In earlier lessons, we went over [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/), [stock market timing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends) and how to [track changing stock market trends](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-handle-changing-stock-market-trends). The concepts and rules covered in those sections are essential to understanding how to buy stocks.




In addition to those strategies, two key factors come into play when searching for the [best stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now/): *what* stocks to buy and *when* to buy them.


This section addresses the first question by looking at [stock ratings](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) and [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) that help you quickly find and evaluate potential [stock picks](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). Here you'll learn to analyze both **fundamentals** (i.e., earnings and other company-related criteria) and **technicals** (i.e., share price, volume and other stock-related factors). The stock ratings in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) instantly diagnose both, That provides a comprehensive look at the health of the company, its stock and the [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/), as well as the general market.


The next section focuses on [Stock Charts And Technical Analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis). It addresses the question of *when* to buy stocks by pinpointing the optimal time to invest with the lowest risk and the highest potential.

It's All Relative
-----------------


With the exception of the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), each of the main IBD stock ratings is relative. They show how your stock compares to all other stocks on the market, instantly separating the leaders from the laggards.


For example, the Earnings-Per-Share (EPS) Rating goes from 1 (worst) to 99 (best). A 95 rating instantly tells you the company is outperforming 95% of all other stocks in terms of both current quarterly and annual earnings growth. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) combines both fundamental and technical analysis to show overall strength, with a 99% Composite Rating meaning the company is in the top 1% of all stocks.


So in one glance at these stock ratings, you can see how your stock compares to all others to improve your potential [stock picks](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Below is a quick overview of each rating.


IBD Composite Rating
--------------------


This gives you an overall score for the stock by combining all other stock ratings into one, with more weight on the EPS and Relative Strength (RS) Ratings.


*Range*: 1 (worst) to 99 (best)


• A 99 rating means the stock is outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of overall fundamental and technical strength.


*What To Look For*: 95 or higher


• The best stocks will often rate 98 or 99 at the time they launch a big price run.


Earnings Per Share (EPS) Rating
-------------------------------


The [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) measures both cuurrent quarterly earnings growth and annual earnings growth. It then compares the company's performance to that of all other stocks.


*Range*: 1 (worst) to 99 (best)


• A 99 rating means the stock is outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of current quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth.


*What To Look For*: 80 or higher


• The best stocks will often rate 98 or 99 at the time they launch a big price run.


Relative Strength (RS) Rating
-----------------------------


You want to focus on the best stocks, those clearly outperforming the rest of the pack. The [Relative Strength (RS) Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is one more way to separate the cream from the rest of the crop. The RS Rating tracks a stock's share price performance over the last 52 weeks, and then compares the result to that of all other stocks. The rating shows clearly if the stock is a market leader or laggard in terms of price performance.


**Tip:** Be sure not to confuse the RS Rating with the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/)*.* The RS line compares the price performance of the stock against that of the S&P 500, which serves as a bellwether for the general market. So a rising RS line shows the stock is a true leader, outperforming the overall market.


*Range*: 1 (worst) to 99 (best)


• A 99 rating means the stock is outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of relative share price performance over the last 52 weeks.


*What To Look For*: 80 or higher


• The best stocks will often rate over 90 at the time they launch a big price run.


Accumulation/Distribution Rating
--------------------------------


Mutual funds and other large investors account for the bulk of all market trading. So it's crucial to track what these [institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-news-performance-reports-investing-ideas/) are buying and selling. The [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) helps you do that by tracking large-volume buying and selling over the last 13 weeks.


*Range*: A+ (best) to E (worst)


• An A+ rating shows that institutional investors are aggressively buying that stock, while an E indicates heavy selling.


*What To Look For*: A, B, C or D rating (the higher the better)


• Like all IBD stock ratings, this score can change quickly. To gauge demand for a stock among large investors, also check [price and volume action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) in the [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/).


SMR Rating
----------


Earnings growth is a key factor that drives stocks, and the [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) tracks the key ingredients that drive earnings: **s**ales growth, profit **m**argins and **r**eturn on equity.


*Range*: A+ (best) to E (worst)


• While tracking [technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) and [market trends](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-handle-changing-stock-market-trends) is crucial, also get to know the story behind the stock, including a stock's revenue growth and the [industry trends](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) behind it.


*What To Look For*: A or B


• A higher rating shows strength in a company's fundamentals by gauging sales growth over the past three quarters, pretax and after-tax profit margins and [ROE](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/return-on-equity-can-help-find-winning-growth-stocks/), which shows how efficiently a company uses its capital.

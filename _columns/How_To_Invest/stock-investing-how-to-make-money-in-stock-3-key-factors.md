When it comes to understanding how to invest in stocks, it can be hard to know where to start. But to stay both protected and profitable in the stock market, focus on three core concepts at the heart of [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). Following this approach will help you zero in on the best stocks to buy and watch at any given time.




While the names, technologies and market trends will change from year to year, you'll find that stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and countless others show strength in each of these three essential factors as they make big price gains.


The IBD Methodology identifies the telltale traits of winning stocks. It covers all aspects of investing in stocks, from [market direction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends) and fundamental analysis of a company's business, to supply and demand and [technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) of a stock's price performance.


While many factors come into play when determining [how to buy stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener) and [when to sell stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks), when you're learning how to invest in stocks, don't overcomplicate it. Staying focused on these three pillars of investing success will keep you grounded as you build on your skills.

1. Manage Risk By Managing Market Exposure
------------------------------------------


Tracking and staying in sync with the general stock market trend is one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). As noted in the section on [market timing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends), over 100 years of market history shows three out of four stocks follow the trend of the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) — either up or down.


That fact underscores this fundamental tenet of stock investing:


**Buy stocks in strong uptrends. Take defensive action when the market weakens.**


You can identify shifting market trends by checking [The Big Picture and Market Pulse](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). Each day, the Market Pulse provides one of five suggested levels of [market exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends/#MarketExposure), ranging from  0% - 20% to 80% - 100%. This is based on multiple factors, including how the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), [industry groups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) and [leading stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) are performing.


This tiered approach also takes into account other factors, such as how many stocks are setting up, breaking out or breaking down. And what is the action and [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) around key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/)? To stay in sync with rising or decreasing risk and opportunity levels, this three-stage system helps investors get gradually in or out of stocks if they start to show signs being overbought or oversold.


So before focusing on the [best stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now/), remember that successful stock investing starts with understanding and staying in sync with the market trend. Keep the odds in your favor by managing your risk/reward ratio based on current market conditions.


2. Focus On Big Earnings Growth Driven By New Product Or Industry Trend
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Here's the second key to successful stock investing:


**Focus on stocks with big earnings and sales growth driven by new products and services.**


Virtually all big winners — including stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet — make their sustained price runs as they post exceptional earnings per share and revenue gains. And these gains typically come from companies as they flash something "new" — a new product, new management, or a new industry trend. This can also apply to stocks that have recently launched a new [initial public offering, or IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/).


When looking for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now/), focus on companies sharing in sync with the four pillars of The [IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-stocks-investing-for-beginners/). You'll find such potential [stock picks](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) using IBD [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), [stock ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener) and the [stock screener](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/).


3. Buy Stocks Top Funds Are Buying — Avoid Those They're Selling
----------------------------------------------------------------


A third essential ingredient for stock investing is this basic concept:


**Buy stocks being heavily bought by large, institutional investors.  

Avoid those they're selling aggressively.**


It's mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and other large money managers that account for the bulk of all trading in the market — not individual investors. Since these professional portfolio managers have the power to significantly move a stock up or down, it's crucial that you pay attention to what they are buying and selling.


You can track the action of [institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/) in a number of ways. IBD regularly reports on what the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-news-performance-reports-investing-ideas/) are doing, including a monthly report on new buys by top money managers. You can also see if large investors are heavily buying or selling individual stocks by monitoring the [IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and the [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


Another vital strategy is to use [stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis). Tracking the price and volume action and behavior at key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) is simply the most timely and objective way to gauge the health of your stocks, without relying on rumors or hearsay. So if you're serious about learning [how to make money in stocks](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Money-Stocks-Getting-Started/dp/0071810110/ref=sr_1_1?crid=QBTNDMKCKPVB&keywords=how+to+make+money+in+stocks+galgani&qid=1658522627&sprefix=how+to+make+money+in+stocks+galgani%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-1), you need use charts to see what large investors are buying or selling right now.

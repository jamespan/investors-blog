**Medpace Holdings** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares consolidate and its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) approaches recent highs.




According to a recent report from Tokyo-based brokerage Minkabu, there are a number of bullish signals surrounding Medpace stock. While the broader market reversed course and ended the day positive, Medpace [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) dipped 2.1% to close at 52.26 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Still, Medpace stock remained within the bounds of a [consolidation](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/price-consolidation-area) and a [buy point](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/buy-point) at 65.19. The stock began consolidating in the second half of September. Shares have climbed 48% year to date, outperforming the broader medical-research group, which has risen about 8%.


"The 5.7% discount to the 12-month high of 65.09 against the 93.4% premium to the 12-month low of 31.75 suggests the stock continues to push for new highs," Minkabu analysts wrote.

Medical-Research Group Proves Its Mettle
----------------------------------------


Medpace stock belongs to the medical-research group, which is ranked No. 39 out of 197 groups that Investor's Business Daily tracks. The group is well represented on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of [elite growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) and includes Medpace, **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)).


[Medical-research stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/life-sciences-drug-development-biotech-big-pharma/) have weathered deeper declines for [biotech and pharmaceutical stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/). Experts say [medical technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-equipment-medtech-2019-preview/) — which includes medical products, research and tools — tends to be a less volatile area of investment.


Medpace belongs to a cadre of contract research organizations. Its peers include **PRA Health** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), **Syneos Health** ([SYNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNH)) and **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)). These firms provide contracted research tools and programs to help biotech, pharma and medtech players with their clinical studies.


Specifically, Medpace provides assistance in Phase 1-4 clinical studies for pharmaceuticals. The company also provides analysis needed for regulatory approval, and performs post-marketing tests of new drugs, according to a Dec. 21 report from Wright Investors' Service.

Medpace stock is also highly rated according to IBD standards. It has a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 99, meaning shares perform in the top 1% of all stocks in [terms of key growth metrics](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/).

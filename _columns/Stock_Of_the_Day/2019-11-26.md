**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the fintech company looks for growth beyond fuel cards. FleetCor stock cleared a buy point on Tuesday.




While it is best known for providing prepaid fuel cards for fleets, FleetCor agreed in March to buy Novicepay, a provider of automated accounts payable services. FleetCor has also opened up its fuel cards to allow cardholders to make additional, authorized business purchases, while testing purchases at **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) using toll cards in Brazil.


The Norcross, Ga., company is part of the elite [IBD 50 stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and among a group of highly rated fintech and payment stocks that have broken out or neared buy range.


The group includes **Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)).


FleetCor Stock Analysis
-----------------------


Shares rose 2.6% to close at 307.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), clearing a 304.75 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a flat base, according to a [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool). Shares also have bounced higher off a recent test at their 50-day average.


Volume was running just above average. Ideally, stocks breaking out should see volume that's at least 40%-50% above average, indicating institutional support.

FleetCor stock has a [95 IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), putting it in the top 5% of stocks based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends.


Its relative strength line, the blue line in IBD charts, has mostly moved sideways since July. That shows it has tracked the S&P 500's performance. But FleetCor's RS line has yet to break out to new highs, which would indicate market leadership.


FleetCor stock already went on a nice run early in the year, rising about 30% after a breakout at the end of February.



Expansion Fuels FleetCor Stock
------------------------------


On Nov. 6, FleetCor reported third-quarter earnings growth of 16% to $3.10 per share, beating views. Revenue grew 10% to $681 million, just above forecasts, nicked by a negative currency impact. Analysts expect more of the same in 2020: 15% EPS growth and 10.6% sales growth, according to Zacks Investment Research.


FleetCor is executing on its "beyond fuel" strategy. In Q3, fuel card revenue made up 42% of the total.


"Our three non-fuel lines of business performed quite well with lodging and toll revenue both up 17% and corporate pay revenue up 24%," CEO Ronald Clarke told analysts on the earnings call.


New bookings rose 14% from a year ago, with over 30,000 new business accounts.


The idea is to expand the network in which current clients can make purchases. For example, clients in Brazil spent $460,000 at **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) last quarter, and that's seen reaching $3 million in 2020.


In September, FleetCor announced that its RFID tags would be factory-installed in all 50,000 Nissan vehicles produced in Brazil each year. In October, FleetCor announced the purchase of Travelliance, which manages lodging payments for airline crews and passengers.


FleetCor's 40%-plus profit margins and healthy free cash flows give it the wherewithal to make acquisitions, a key to future growth.

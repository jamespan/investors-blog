**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as oil prices rise after another surprise move from OPEC+. FANG stock flashed a buy signal.




U.S. oil prices retook the $60-per-barrel level Thursday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and top nonmembers, collectively known as OPEC+, unexpectedly agreed to [increase production in May](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-fall-opec-plus-meet-april-2021-production-cut-extension-saudi-arabia-russia/).


But the pace of increases through July was still seen as cautious and supportive of oil prices. And shale producers like Diamondback Energy are expected to avoid big surges in production that could send oil prices back into a steel slump again.


"While U.S. producers have been a disruptor over the past decade, we currently see this as unlikely in 2021," wrote Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge Group in a note Wednesday. "There have been several factors that have restrained production in the U.S., but what our experts believe is that prices need to be sustained above $60 for at least three months followed by six months of drilling before shale starts to show material growth."


OPEC+ also expects the U.S. shale sector to be more subdued after being at odds for the last several years.


"Drill, baby, drill is gone forever," Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said in March during a [post-meeting press conference](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-opec-meeting-march-2021-saudi-arabia-russia-production-deal/).


But while shale producers collectively should stay in check, Diamondback Energy sees its own average daily oil production rising to 308,000-325,000 barrels per day this year, from its average of 300,000 in 2020.

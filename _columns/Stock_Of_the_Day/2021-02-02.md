Sports betting specialist **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as it breaks out on news that **Ark Next Generation Internet ETF** ([ARKW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARKW)) started a notable position. DKNG stock jumped past a buy point.




Late Monday, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest disclosed a new position of 620,300 DKNG shares at a value of $33.89 million. ARK Fund purchases, especially new or big additions, often spark a lot of follow-on share buying by other investors.


Meanwhile, research firm Benchmark raised its price target for DraftKings stock to $66 from $60. The stock is also grabbing attention lately because **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) recently announced it's allowing sports-betting apps on its store starting March 1.


Famed growth investor Mark Minervini touted the DKNG stock chart on Monday's [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).

DraftKings Stock
----------------


DraftKings stock gapped up 8.55% to 59.31 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). Shares [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) and past a 56.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). DKNG stock is now extended from the 5% buy zone, which runs to 58.88.


DraftKings stock had flirted with a breakout several times in the past few sessions, even narrowly closing above the buy point on Jan. 28, but Tuesday's price-and-volume action was much more convincing.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is still off its early October peak, but has outperformed solidly since the early November stock market rally took hold. The RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, tracks a stock's price action vs. the S&P 500 index. The rising line tells you that DKNG stock is outperforming the benchmark index.


DraftKings stock, an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, has an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93 out of a possible 99. This rating measures a stock's performance over the last 52 weeks vs. all other stocks.


DraftKings has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of just 25, as the company is not yet profitable.



Among other sports betting plays, [**Penn National Gaming**](https://www.investors.com/news/penn-stock-buy-now/) ([PENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PENN)) rose 6.4%, [**MGM Resorts**](https://www.investors.com/news/mgm-stock-buy-now/) ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)) 4.7%, **Caesars Entertainment** ([CZR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CZR)) 7.3% and **Bally's** ([BALY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BALY)) 3.9%. PENN stock hit a new high while MGM and Caesars reclaimed their rising 50-day lines.


Legalized Gambling Fuels DraftKings Growth
------------------------------------------


DraftKings has benefited from the [expansion of legal gambling](https://www.investors.com/news/gambling-stocks-sports-betting-state-ballot-measures/) throughout the U.S. After the last election cycle, 21 U.S. jurisdictions now have made it legal to wager on sports.


Most recently, [New York announced](https://www.investors.com/news/draftkings-mgm-gaming-stocks-rise-as-new-york-cuomo-eyes-online-sports-betting/) on Jan. 5 legislation that would open the door to legalize sports betting. The Empire State is considered one of the Big Four with Michigan, California and Florida that industry experts say could provide the biggest revenue boost for companies like DraftKings and rival Penn National Gaming. Michigan approved sports betting in 2020. California and Florida have yet to pass legislation.


DraftKings' Q3 revenue surged 98% year over year to $132.8 million. The company raised its full-year 2020 revenue outlook to $540 million-$560 million, which represents a 25%-30% annual revenue growth rate. DraftKings reports Q4 and full-year earnings on Feb. 26.


DraftKings also offered 2021 revenue guidance of $750 million to $850 million, which represents 45% year-over-year growth using the midpoints.


The company has been spending big on customer acquisition over the past year, a point of concern for some Wall Street analysts. Others say the high customer acquisition costs are typical for a business in the early stages of growth. DraftKings will air two ads for the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 7. Each 30-second spot for the Super Bowl costs $5.6 million.


DraftKings launched operations in its 12th state on Jan. 24 in Virginia. "Just in time for Super Bowl LV, we are thrilled to bring the DraftKings sports betting experience to Virginia with an abundance of betting options for fans," said Jason Robins, co-founder and chief executive of DraftKings, in a statement.

DraftKings Partners With Pro Teams, Media Giants
------------------------------------------------


[DraftKings](https://www.investors.com/research/draftkings-dkng-stock-buy-now/) has steadily built up its portfolio of professional tie-ups, which are expected to bring it added exposure to new customers. NBA legend Michael Jordan joined the company's board of directors as a special advisor on Sept. 2.


On Sept. 14, DraftKings entered into a multiyear agreement with [**Disney**'s](https://www.investors.com/research/disney-stock-buy-now/) ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) ESPN to become a co-exclusive sportsbook and fantasy sports provider of the media giant.


In October, DraftKings signed a deal to integrate its content with **[AT&T](https://www.investors.com/research/att-stock-buy-now/)**['s](https://www.investors.com/research/att-stock-buy-now/) ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) Turner Sports platforms. The agreement made DraftKings the exclusive sportsbook and daily fantasy sports provider across select Turner Sports and Bleacher Report properties.


It also has partnerships with the NFL's New York Giants and MLB's Chicago Cubs.

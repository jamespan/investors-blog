**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of computer network gear nears a new flat-base entry. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/) of ANET stock also is at a new high.




On a weekly chart, Arista stock has forged an entry point of 134.24. ANET stock has been extended after shares soared on Nov. 2 following its third-quarter earnings report. Arista stock forecast 2022 revenue growth of nearly 30%, well above analyst estimates.


A rival of **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), Arista also announced a 4-for-1 stock split as well as a $1 billion stock buyback program.


Amid supply chain shortages, both Arista and Cisco recently pushed through price hikes that will give 2022 revenue a boost.

ANET Stock: Microsoft, Facebook Big Customers
---------------------------------------------


Arista's biggest growth driver has been network switches that speed up communications among racks of computer servers packed into data centers. Two of its biggest customers have been **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Facebook, whose parent is **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). Facebook plans to hike capital spending on internet data centers next year.


Microsoft and Facebook operate so-called "hyperscale" data centers. They're designed to ratchet up computing horsepower when demand surges.


Arista has been the primary supplier of 100-gigabit network switches to internet companies. A new battle looms as internet companies upgrade to 400-gigabit networks from 100G technology.


Microsoft is expected to lead in data center upgrades to 400G in 2022, analysts say. Meta Platforms may follow in 2023. That could give Cisco and **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) an opportunity to win business at Arista's expense, analysts say.


While Arista's primary customers have been internet companies, it's gaining traction in the corporate market. The company has projected 100% sales growth to $400 million in 2022 for "campus" network switching gear sold to large companies.


Arista Acquisitions Expand Market
---------------------------------


However, Cisco stock is the biggest provider by far of networking gear to enterprise customers — large companies, government agencies and educational institutions.


Two ANET stock acquisitions — Mojo Networks in 2018 and Awake Security last year — targeted the enterprise market. Mojo Networks makes gear for wireless local area networks. Awake Security uses artificial intelligence software to monitor computer networks for hacker activity.


Arista's largest acquisition was Big Switch Networks in 2020. Big Switch makes software for network management software for companies using multiple cloud computing services.


ANET stock has gained 82% in 2021. Shares added 1.1% to close at 132.18 Monday.


The IBD Computer Network group ranks No. 26 out of 197 groups tracked. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Rating of Arista stock is 98 out of a best possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-arista-networks-inc-anet.aspx). The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.


ANET Stock: Institutional Ownership Strong
------------------------------------------


ANET stock owns an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of only B-plus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


For the September quarter, Arista earnings per share rose 22% vs. a year earlier to $2.96, topping estimates of $2.73. Revenue grew 24% to $748.7 million, beating forecasts for $738 million.

**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with UNH stock offering a new buying opportunity, despite coming off intraday highs. That comes as the Dow Jones health insurer said coronavirus costs will be a notable drag on 2021 earnings.




Other health insurers, including **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) and **Molina Health** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)), also rose solidly.


The Dow Jones medical and managed care giant offered 2021 earnings guidance of $17.75-$18.25 per share. That includes a negative Covid-19 impact of $1.80 a share. Wall Street consensus for UnitedHealth earnings next year was $18.32 a share.


While releasing new guidance at its Dec. 1 investor day, UnitedHealth management highlighted long-term targets: Annual EPS growth of 13% to 16%, with about two-thirds driven by operating results and one-third from stock buybacks. The 2021 outlook assumes $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in UNH stock buybacks.

UNH Stock
---------


UNH stock rose 1.4% to 341.19 after rising as high as 354.10 in Tuesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-signal-stock-market-rally-tesla-stock-nio-xpeng-moderna-zoom-move/). The Dow Jones stock is working on a new consolidation and is 7% off its Nov. 9 high.


The bounce from its 10-week line, which began from Monday's intraday low, offers a new buying opportunity.


The 50-day or 10-week moving average is often a place where mutual funds and other big institutions will add shares. As long as the [current stock market uptrend is intact](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), and the 50-day/10-week line is above the prior buy point, investors can buy off the first or second rebound.


However, Tuesday's weak close wasn't a great sign. Investors might want to wait for UNH stock to show more strength before taking a position.



UNH stock is about 5% above the 10-week line, still in buy range.


[UnitedHealth stock](https://www.investors.com/research/unh-stock-buy-now/) surged to a record high on 2020 election results, which greatly diminished chances of major health care reform. Subsequently, UNH stock fell back amid the upsurge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths, before finding support at its 50-day line.


UNH stock is in the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) stock list. Long-Term Leaders have demonstrated consistently strong earnings and stock-price performance, which make them eligible for buying on pullbacks.


Other Health Insurers
---------------------


Among other health insurers, Humana reaffirmed 2020 guidance. Humana stock rose 1.3%, but remains below its 50-day line. **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) reversed to closed down 0.8%. CI stock is working on a short consolidation that could be viewed as a handle to a 15-month cup base.


Medicaid-focused Molina Health stock rose 1.5%, rebounding from its 10-week line like UNH stock but also closing well off intraday highs. **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), another Medicaid-focused insurer, popped 2%, closing above its 200-day line but not its 50-day.


UnitedHealth 2021 Outlook
-------------------------


In a brief morning note, Jefferies analyst David Windley wrote that the UnitedHealth earnings per share guidance for 8% growth is shy of its long-term 13%-16% target. Yet, if not for the $1.80-per-share Covid hit, 2021 "growth would be an impressive 18%."


Windley also highlighted UnitedHealth's outlook for about 13.5% growth in Medicare Advantage members. UnitedHealth expects a range of 750,000 to 800,000 additional Medicare Advantage members, up from the current total of 5.74 million.


UnitedHealth's Optum medical services arm is expected to see its operating profit margin widen in 2021, as the coronavirus pandemic wanes and nonemergency care recovers. However, United HealthCare, the managed care arm, is likely to see its medical cost ratio rebound to more normal levels.

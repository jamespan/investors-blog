Mention **Church & Dwight** ([CHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHD)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), and Arm & Hammer baking soda may spring to mind. You're missing the bigger story. The consumer giant boasts that 40% of sales are driven by new products.




Church & Dwight's OxiClean Odor Blasters cater to consumers wearing more synthetic fabrics. Its L'il Critters gummy vitamins give the kiddos a fruit-flavored alternative to hard pills. Its Nirvana condoms offer "unique sensory experiences."


Those new offerings for 2018 have resonated with buyers, CEO Matthew Farrell said Nov. 11. Church & Dwight earnings and sales topped third-quarter estimates that day, with the company raising full-year sales and cash flow targets.


"Innovation continues to be a big driver of our success," Farrell added, while noting solid sales growth both at home and abroad.


The New Jersey-based company is especially focused on mainland China for long-term growth.

IBD Stock Of The Day Earnings Growth Solid
------------------------------------------


The stock's strong fundamentals are reflected in a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 97. It boasts a solid but not stellar [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 80.

Church & Dwight Stock Offers Defensive Appeal
---------------------------------------------


Consumer staples stocks tend to deliver slow and steady growth, not rapid returns. Church & Dwight earnings growth has been 10% a year for the past three years. Analysts see EPS jumping 18% this year, then slowing to 8% in 2019.


But investors flock to such names in volatile times as safe-haven plays. No matter how ugly it gets out there, consumers will need their laundry detergent, cat litter and toothpaste.


Church & Dwight stock has soared 38% in the past year, handily outpacing larger peers. **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) has eked out a 2% gain over the same period, while **Colgate-Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)) has given up 15%.


Church & Dwight stock has a 1.3% dividend yield.

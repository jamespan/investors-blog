**Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as footwear brands are off to a running start in the new year.




Goleta, Calif.-based Deckers Outdoor produces a variety of lifestyle, running and comfort shoes. Its portfolio includes the Ugg, Teva and Sanuk brands as well as the increasingly popular Hoka running shoes.


Shoe Stocks Find Their Stride
-----------------------------


Footwear stocks are cruising to start the year. **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) has had a bit of a wild run as it handily beat Q4 earnings on Feb. 16. CROX stock is up 26% over the past three months but only up about 14% year to date. **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) has made less progress, climbing only 6.3% so far this year as earnings declined in the past three quarters.


Switzerland-based **On Holdings** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) saw sales leap 55% in 2022, pointing the stock [toward a $5 billion valuation](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/onon-stock-is-barely-breaking-a-sweat-on-its-5-billion-climb/).


Meanwhile, RBC Capital noted last week that sentiment around **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) has turned less negative in recent months, due to China reopening and progress on excess inventories.


In a Feb. 6 research note, BTIG analyst Janine Stichter assumed coverage of Deckers with a buy rating and a 515 price target. She wrote that the Ugg brand's strong execution and resonance with younger consumers should support Deckers' solid, steady growth. Meanwhile, Hoka's continued expansion should continue at a robust pace.


Stichter noted that Hoka generated $1.3 billion in revenue over the last 12 months, suggesting a long runway for the brand. She considers Hoka as "being diversified across product category and geography."  Stichter added that "strong brands will fare best" in the current environment, which fits Deckers' description "to a tee."


Deckers Outdoor Earnings
------------------------


Deckers Outdoor cleared estimates for its Q3 results on Feb. 2 as earnings jumped 24% to $10.48 per share. Revenue growth slowed for the third quarter in a row, climbing 13% to $1.345 billion.


Meanwhile, Hoka sales catapulted 90.8% to $352.1 million. And with spring around the corner, Ugg sales dipped 1.6% to $930.4 million.


For fiscal 2023, Deckers Outdoor forecasts up to 13.8% earnings growth to a range of $18 to $18.50 per share on 11%-12% revenue growth.


"The consistent strength of Deckers results thus far in fiscal year 2023, despite macroeconomic and currency headwinds, are the result of our brand marketplace management actions and dedication to long-term strategic priorities," CEO Dave Powers said in the release. "We believe UGG and HOKA are two of the healthiest, well positioned brands in their respective markets, and with the strength of our operating model, Deckers is poised for continued success going forward."


DECK Stock
----------



DECK stock is actionable after bouncing from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and retaking its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It's arguably breaking a tight [downward-sloping trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) after rising from its 10-day line on Tuesday.

It has a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines a number of technical indicators into one score.

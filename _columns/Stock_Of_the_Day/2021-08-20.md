Rally Sets New Buy Point
------------------------


Investors could have used Thursday's high of 119.25 as a buy point, according to [IBD analysis](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/). The buy zone for that buy point runs to 125.21. A stop-loss sell point would be a decisive close below Thursday's low of 114.65.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Unity stock climbed 5.5% to close at 122.84.


San Francisco-based Unity went public in September 2020 with its shares priced $52. It notched a record high of 174.94 on Dec. 23.


Unity Software makes 3D animation software for video games, advertising and other applications. It also provides tools for creating, running and monetizing games and other content.


The company is not yet profitable, but is headed in the right direction as it gradually reduces its quarterly losses, analysts say.


Unity Stock Is On Two IBD Watchlists
------------------------------------


Wall Street analysts are encouraged by Unity's efforts to diversify its business beyond the video game industry.


"Management sees nongaming vertical adoption picking up pace as vertical customers seek novel digital content to attract customers as well as winning new clients," Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang said in a recent note to clients. He rates Unity stock as outperform with a price target of 125.


Unity stock is on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock lists.

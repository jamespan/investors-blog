Even with the Nasdaq composite logging losses Thursday, [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Interxion** ([INXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INXN)) is bucking tech-stock weakness and retaking a key technical level in heavy volume.




Interxion Stock Action
----------------------


Interxion stock rose 1.7% to 65.07 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), reclaiming its 50-day moving average with conviction after slipping below that level earlier this week. Retaking the 50-day line in heavy volume is bullish action.


Interxion is a Dutch-based company that operates data centers and related services, with its co-location centers serving multiple clients via one physical location.


The network solutions firm, a peer ofÂ **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)), is now trading 3% below a [flat-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) of 67.29.


Keep an eye on the [relative strength](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/) line, which is trending higher Thursday but has yet to reverse a downward trend since peaking in early May. The relative strength line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. A lagging RS line indicates weakness compared with the broader market. On the upside, Interxion stock had an RS line trending higher from December 2016 to May 2018.



Stock Of The Day
----------------


This Stock of the Day has been on a considerable run, gaining nearly 70% since breaking out of a cup base in February 2017. With that climb, Interxion's latest base pattern would not be considered an [early-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). Later-stage bases have a lower chance of success, but they can work.

Interxion has an IBD Composite Rating of 82 out of 99, ranking it No. 5 in the Internet-Network Solutions industry group, behind **Tucows** ([TCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCX)), **Radcom** ([RDCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDCM)), **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) and Akamai Technologies. The CR combines fundamental and technical metrics; a rating of 90 or above is seen as very strong.


Interxion Earnings Growth
-------------------------


Another important factor to note is the company's quarterly financials. Interxion earnings in the March quarter missed analyst estimates. EPS growth slowed to 21% from 43% in the December quarter. Revenue increased 17%, a decline from the 34% growth it saw in Q4.


Tech Stock Reporting Soon
-------------------------


However, upcoming quarterly results in a few weeks could provide a catalyst for the stock. Analysts expect Interxion earnings growth to pick up to 31%.

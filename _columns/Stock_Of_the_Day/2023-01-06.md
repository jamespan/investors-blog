**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The cruelty-free beauty and cosmetics company raced past a new buy point Friday after soaring following its late-July breakout.




Oakland, Calif.-based ELF Beauty is a plant-based, animal-testing-free makeup and skin care company. Its brands include ELF Cosmetics, ELF Skin, Well People and Keys. ELF's moderately priced products are sold online and at department and specialty stores, after shutting down its retail operations in 2019.


Unlike other cosmetics companies, ELF doesn't test its products on animals and it is certified as cruelty free by People For The Ethical Treatment of Animals. And its line of products at affordable price points make it popular among consumers.


ELF Earnings Growth Accelerates
-------------------------------


ELF earnings growth has accelerated for the past two quarters, from -19% to 71% in fiscal Q2 ending in September. Revenue growth has sped up for three straight quarters, including 71% in Q2. But those runs might be ending. ELF earnings are expected to dip 4% to 23 cents per share in Q3 as sales jump 24% to $121.3 million, according to FactSet.


Still, ELF stock is up 85% over the last year as the S&P 500 suffered declines. The outstanding performance garnered ELF Beauty strong institutional support. And the number of funds holding ELF Beauty stock grew to 454 in December from 374 in March.

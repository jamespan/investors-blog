Autodesk Stock: Relative Strength Line At Record High
-----------------------------------------------------


The San Rafael, Calif.-based company provides design software and services for the architectural, construction, engineering and manufacturing industries. It also serves the entertainment and media industries.


Autodesk stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87. That means it has outperformed 87% of stocks over the past 12 months. The best growth stocks typically have RS Ratings of at least 80.


In a bullish sign, the company's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was in record high territory on Monday. But volume was tracking well below average.


Autodesk declined to comment.


Autodesk stock ranks No. 28 on the IBD 50 list. Other software-as-a-service and cloud-computing companies on the list include **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


Adobe stock is approaching a buy point of 350.48 out of a cup-with-handle base. Microsoft stock is trading near its buy point of 175.10 from a recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). ServiceNow has been [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) for the past 10 weeks with a buy point of 363.05.



Autodesk Touted For 'Balanced Business'
---------------------------------------


Autodesk stock ranks fourth out of 11 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Design industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-autodesk-inc-adsk.aspx). That group ranks No. 24 out of [197 industry groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


Autodesk is seeing macroeconomic pressures related to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the company also is showing strength in areas such as renewal rates, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said in an April 15 note to clients.


"Overall, we believe that while Autodesk isn't immune to an economic slowdown, it has a balanced business that is likely more resilient than some might expect, particularly with 95% recurring revenue," Hedberg said. He rates Autodesk stock as outperform with a price target of 205.

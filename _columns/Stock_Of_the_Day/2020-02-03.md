[IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) stands out among software stocks as a leader in software-as-a-service, digital transformation and artificial intelligence. But the company's big appetite for acquisitions has weighed at times on Salesforce stock.




Salesforce stock has formed a new [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after breaking out early last month. The proper buy point is the result of a four-week variant of a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). Salesforce stock also sports a [rising relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), also a bullish signal.


Shares added 1.7% to close at 185.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Salesforce stock lagged many [high-growth enterprise software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/saas-stocks-cloud-stocks/) in 2019 as well as the oft-watched iShares Expanded Tech-Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) ETF. Investors fretted over its organic growth amid the $15.7 billion all-stock deal to buy data analytics firm Tableau Software. Investors wondered whether margin-harming deals would continue.


Following the early January rally, investors have the opportunity to take a new position or add shares if Salesforce clears that 186.54 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Meanwhile, the fierce debate over whether organic growth is slowing significantly as well as the performance of acquired assets goes on.


Salesforce Stock: Debate Over Acquisitions, Organic Growth
----------------------------------------------------------


The company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings in early March. That's the next time investors expect management to comment on synergies coming from the Tableau deal as well as the $6.5 billion purchase of MuleSoft in 2018.

Amid investor angst over mergers, Salesforce continues to make a case that the Tableau and MuleSoft acquisitions, as well as the earlier Exact Target and Demandware purchases, have been well executed.



"We think strong results via acquired assets can shift sentiment in 2020," UBS analyst Jennifer Lowe said in a recent report to clients. She added: "Growth through (mergers) proved a challenge for **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)). But Salesforce's strategy is more offensive than defensive."


Salesforce.com sells software under a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. The company has expanded into marketing, e-commerce and data analytics.


Company officials wouldn't comment further beyond recent remarks made at the company's Investor Day.


Salesforce Builds Strong Management Team
----------------------------------------


Amid the acquisitions, Salesforce has also built a stronger management team, analysts say. In 2018, Salesforce named Keith Block as co-chief executive along with founder Marc Benioff. It's been speculated Benioff could leave one day to pursue political or other interests.


A former Oracle executive, Block joined Salesforce in 2013. Block has focused Salesforce on vertical markets such as consumer, retail banking and the federal government, said Baird analyst Rob Oliver in a January report.


"Co-CEO Keith Block's mantra 'Speaking the language of the customer' has helped drive an inherently horizontal solution more deeply into industries that demand profound domain expertise around their [Digital Transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/) initiatives," said Oliver.


Salesforce recently announced that Chief Product Officer Bret Taylor had been appointed president and chief operating officer. Taylor came to Salesforce via the acquisition of Quip, a company he co-founded. Taylor earlier served as chief technology officer of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


Salesforce in January hired former LinkedIn executive Doug Camplejohn as the new executive vice president in charge of its core Sales Cloud business. San Francisco-based Salesforce was interested in buying LinkedIn before **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) gobbled it up for $26.2 billion in 2016.


Salesforce Stock: Margin Improvement On Horizon?
------------------------------------------------


The Sales Cloud business accounted for 28% of total subscription revenue in the September quarter.


At UBS, Lowe expects Salesforce to remain acquisitive. She estimated that it could spend $6 billion or more on purchases annually.


At an investor day in November, Salesforce forecast fiscal 2024 revenue in the range of $34 billion to $35 billion, implying an annual growth rate of 20% or better. The company didn't promise meaningful profit-margin expansion.


"While M&A has certainly contributed to the healthy growth rates, we see strong momentum in CRM's core portfolio as well," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman in a January report. "We view most of the recent transactions favorably, though we think the negative impact to margins remains a concern for potential future deals."


Salesforce has made small acquisitions to boost its [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) capabilities. The software company continues to integrate its Einstein AI tools into more products. The company last year unveiled new Einstein platform services that enable users to easily build custom AI-powered apps.

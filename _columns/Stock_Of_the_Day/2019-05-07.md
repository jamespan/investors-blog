**Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), and the hot stock market leader has been acting chill lately. But on Tuesday the stock held just 9% below a new [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 95.76 in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).


Most people hear about cryogenics or cryogenic freezing only when it comes to some eccentric celebrity trying to preserve their remains for "future resuscitation."




But in industry and energy, cryogenic freezing applies to a broad range of industrial and energy production processes. The U.S. [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) says cryogenics deals with temperatures of minus 292 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. That's the comfort zone for Chart Industries, which makes equipment to chill, store and transport gases at temperatures approaching absolute zero, or minus 459 degrees.


The liquefaction, transport and regasification of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is one key area of Chart's expertise. Another is the separation and processing of natural gas liquids.


Analysts at Mackenzie & Wood announced in April that "the LNG boom is back." They forecast more than $200 billion in infrastructure spending between 2019 and 2025.


Chart's sales to industrial gas end-users made up 53% of its $1.08 billion in 2018 revenue. Energy industry sales were 47% of that total. Key customers include **Air Products** ([APD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APD)), Praxair (acquired by Linde in March), engineering giant Bechtel Corp., and the largest energy names, led by **ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) and **PetroChina** ([PTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTR)).

IBD Stock Of The Day: Tops In Cryogenic Freezing, LNG, Natural Gas Liquids
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chart operates in three segments. The largest and most profitable is its D&S West unit. It covers the U.S. and Latin America, providing equipment and solutions for the storage and delivery of liquids used in cryogenic freezing, storage and transport of industrial gases and in LNG applications. The unit generated 42% of total 2018 revenue, and reported operating income of $101 million, up 19%, for 2018.


D&S East generated 22% of 2018 revenue. Its operations are similar to D&S West, but it operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. It had a 22% share of total revenue, with a 36% jump in operating income, to $19.3 million.


A Strategic Acquisition Made In Italy
-------------------------------------


The Energy & Chemicals segment deals with natural gas and petrochemical production, refining and processing. This division delivered 36% of revenue, with operating income up 400% in 2018 to $25.5 million. D&S East and E&C profits received a boost during the year from Chart's $235 million acquisition of Italy-based VRV.


The VRV deal also helped boost Chart's long-term debt. The company reported debt due more than a year from now of $533 million at the end of the year and in the first quarter. That was up about 7% from a year earlier.


Chart's [debt-to-equity ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-growth-stocks-earnings-2019/) is 60%, about midway among its top 10 energy equipment making peers, and just above the 50% average.


Its return on equity stands at 7.7%. That is below the 21.6% average of its 10 closest peers. That average, however, is skewed by new issue [Cactus](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-growth-stocks-earnings-2019/) ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)). Year-old Cactus boasts an ROE of 189.1%. Chart's 10 closest peers minus Cactus show an average ROE of 2.7%, putting Chart in strong competitive standing.


Chart reported early on April 18 that its first-quarter earnings soared 117%, boosted by VRV, while sales gained 19%. Both numbers fell short of analyst forecasts. When the market opened, Chart stock turned its early 6.5% gain into a 1% loss.

IBD Stock Of The Day: Chart's Strengths, Flaws
----------------------------------------------


But the stock has proved resilient. It staged a nice breakout above an 80.41 [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) buy point following its fourth-quarter report in February. It rose 19%, then leveled off in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). It has since staged a series of very [tight weekly closes](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tight-weekly-closes-quiet-trade-monster-base/). That is one positive sign of institutional support.


Another is it's [hugging its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-school-using-regenerons-five-year-rally-to-study-support/), quickly recovering from its one deep dip below that line to end at the very top of the week's trading range.


Not all of Chart Industries' technical gauges are positive. Its [Up/Down Volume Ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) is 0.8, below the 1.0 minimum that indicates upward pressure on the stock. Its [Accumulation/Distribution grade](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-key-to-investment-success/) is a so-so C, suggesting institutional shareholders are neither buying nor selling.


Chart's Composite Rating from IBD is a passable but less than stellar 82, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). The [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge the strengths of a company's stock.


But the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is hovering just below highs, pretty much where you'd like to see it ahead of a possible breakout. If that line starts moving to new highs before the stock reaches the buy point, it could signal a power breakout ahead.

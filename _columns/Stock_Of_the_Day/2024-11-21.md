Cloudflare Stock: AI, Crypto Developers
---------------------------------------


On Cloudflare's Q3 conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Matthew Prince said its cloud platform appeals to a wide range of software developers building artificial intelligence and other applications.


"If you look across the AI ecosystem, if you look across the sort of blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, if you look across anywhere where someone is able to start with a blank slate, we're seeing adoption rate in the top startups," he said.


Cryptocurrency prices have jumped since Donald Trump triumphed in the 2024 Presidential election. [Bitcoin rose again](http://nvestors.com/news/bitcoin-price-98000-record-trump-crypto-cabinet-bitcoin-options/) on Thursday, extending its postelection rally. Bitcoin notched a record high above $98,000.


[Generative artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chatgpt-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-in-content-creating-artificial-intelligence-get-ready-for-a-lot-of-disruption/) has been a hot topic for investors since the emergence of ChatGPT maker OpenAI in late 2022. Further, Cloudflare has ties to OpenAI. Cloudflare provides secure links to cloud services when consumers sign up to use ChatGPT, a conversational chatbot.


Nvidia, Microsoft Partnerships
------------------------------


Also, Cloudflare has increased investments in AI infrastructure amid an alliance with chipmaker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Cloudflare has deployed Nvidia AI chips in its global network. The AI networking cards are plugged into computer server PCI slots, lowering capital spending needs.


Meanwhile, Nvidia stock fell on Thursday following its [third quarter earnings report.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-wall-street-reactions-q3-earnings/)


In 2023, Cloudflare announced its "Workers AI" platform and partnerships with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), privately held Databricks and Hugging Face.


In a recent report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said Cloudflare "leverages a global network of PoPs (points of presence) and a serverless architecture."


"Management believes gen AI will be a significant long-term trend and believes the company is ready for the opportunity through its vast network of PoPs that are (Nvidia) GPU-enabled to run edge-based inferencing requests for models," Hedberg added.


"The company also believes they are well positioned for next-gen gen AI companies to build their applications on the Workers platform."


In a June report, Morgan Stanley speculated that there could be upside for Cloudflare stock from Apple's new artificial intelligence services on iPhones. Apple has launched Private Cloud Compute (PCC), a cloud computing based system, for private AI processing.


"We have reasons to believe that Cloudflare is the main provider of Apple PCC," said Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring.

**Brinker International** ([EAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAT)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the Chili's operator rallied along with other restaurant stocks. Brinker flashed a buy signal Wednesday amid its nearly 80% rally this year.




The Dallas-based casual dining company operates Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy. It is coming off historically strong revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, reported on Aug. 14. Both earnings and revenue came in well above analyst predictions last quarter, with profit growing 16% to $1.61 per share and sales totaling $1.21 billion, up 12% vs. a year ago.


However, weak guidance for 2025 sent EAT shares down 10.7% on Aug. 14. Brinker International projected full-year EPS of $4.35-$4.75, up from $4.10 in fiscal 2024. Brinker expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $4.55 billion to $4.62 billion after sales came in at $4.41 billion in fiscal 2024.


While EAT stock tumbled on Aug. 14, hitting an intraday low of 58.85, shares have roared back 30% since then.


Overall, the analysts' view on Brinker heading into fiscal 2025 is that while Chili's same-store sales growth is sustaining high single-digit levels, incremental investments and reluctance to raise menu prices are limiting EPS upside.


Brinker has averaged 16% earnings growth over the past three quarters, but the consensus sees fiscal Q1 profit ballooning 118% vs. a year ago.


More broadly, the 54 stocks in the IBD-tracked [Retail-Restaurants industry group](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) have collectively gained around 19% in 2024.

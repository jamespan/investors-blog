Altair Stock: 2017 IPO
----------------------


The Troy, Mich.-based company earned an adjusted 40 cents a share on sales of $171.5 million in the December-ended quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Altair earnings rose 11% while sales increased 4%.


"Software revenue grew 5.9% to $153.8 million and was driven by high retention rates, new customer growth, and expansions," said RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg in a report. "Upside was due to good execution but also some deals closing sooner than expected. Management also noted that growth continues to be broad-based across geographies and verticals."


Analysts say companies are using simulation software earlier in the product development cycle.


"The company continues to leverage its platform computational intelligence to capitalize on the growing number of users and use-cases of simulation across key industries by emphasizing the democratization of these tools through integrated artificial intelligence and data analytics," said William Blair analyst Dylan Becker in a report.


He added: "This has enabled the company to expand its targeted base to those earlier in the development life cycle, which tend to be less technical, design-focused users. In addition, we believe the growing prioritization of data-driven decision-making and generative AI design capabilities will unlock significant cost savings for Altair's core customer segment over time."


The company went public at 13 on Nov. 1, 2017. The IPO raised $144 million.


Altair belongs to IBD's Computer-Software Design group. That group ranks No. 157 out of 197 industry groups.

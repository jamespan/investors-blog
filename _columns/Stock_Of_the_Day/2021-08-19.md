Nvidia Stock Nears Buy Point
----------------------------


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Nvidia stock rose 4% to 197.98.


Nvidia stock is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 207.43, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


However, aggressive investors could have used Nvidia's move above its Tuesday high of 197.70 as an early entry because it cleared a short downtrend.


Thursday's low of 187.62 is a good stop-loss sell point as that would be a decisive fall below it 10-week moving average line.


In a positive sign, Nvidia stock has surged above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/).

In a note to clients, Muse said he was impressed by the company's accelerating data center sales.


"We continue to view Nvidia as one of the best secular growth stories as the company continues to position itself as *the* AI Compute Platform Company," Muse said.

Cybersecurity stock **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Proofpoint stock is in a buy zone with a rising relative strength line as Wall Street analysts look for more consistency after a fourth-quarter earnings beat. Bullish analysts expect a 2018 acquisition to be a growth driver.




Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection. It's a member of IBD's Computer-Software Security group, which [ranks No. 14 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-14-2019/). (Learn more about the cybersecurity stocks at [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).)


In addition, Proofpoint touts a highest possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99 and a Relative Strength Rating of 90. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) are other cybersecurity stocks with Composite Ratings of 99.


The relative strength line, meanwhile, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. A rising line signals outperformance.

Furthermore, Proofpoint stock formed a cup chart pattern before climbing above an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 121.72. The base has a depth of 41%. That's a reason for caution. Bases with depths of more than 40% often are unable to meaningfully advance.


Proofpoint stock edged up 0.4% to close at 124.09 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Email protection is just one part of the much larger [cybersecurity market](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/).


Proofpoint Competes With Microsoft
----------------------------------


Notably, Proofpoint stock sports an [Accumulation-Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-key-to-investment-success/) of A+. The Accumulation-Distribution Rating analyzes a stock's price and volume trends over the prior 13 weeks.


After a rough patch in mid-2018, Proofpoint's fourth-quarter profit beat estimates. The cybersecurity firm said adjusted earnings were 37 cents a share, up 27% from a year ago, topping estimates of 35 cents.


In fiscal 2019, analysts project EPS growth of 12% to $1.65. In 2020, analysts estimate better EPS growth of 36% to $2.25.


Proofpoint competes with **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)), **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)), **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) as well as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


"We believe concerns about Microsoft's refreshed email-related product are proving to be exaggerated," said Shaul Eyal, an Oppenheimer analyst in a February report.


Proofpoint's Wombat Acquisition A Bright Spot
---------------------------------------------


Proofpoint has been positioning itself as the cybersecurity vendor for "people-centric" security, with a broad range of offerings for protecting employees from attacks.


Analysts expect upside from Proofpoint's acquisition of Wombat Security Technologies. Proofpoint bought Wombat, a spinoff from Carnegie Mellon University, for $225 million in early 2018. Wombat specializes in detecting phishing scams.


In phishing scams, hackers send fake emails that are designed to trick company employees into clicking on a link that sends them to a bogus webpage. There, hackers aim to obtain pass codes and other personal data.


Analysts also expect Proofpoint upside from international growth. The cybersecurity firm has revamped its sales force and is hiring overseas.


"Overall we found management's tone to be much better vs. 90 days ago," RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg said following its Q4 earnings report. "They believe they have the sales structure and products in place to deliver 20%-plus organic growth for 'several years to come.' "

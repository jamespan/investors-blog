The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, remains near its all-time high.


The flat base is a key weapon in any canny investor's armory. The [pattern reflects unusual strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). Instead of bending lower in a weak market, a stock won't cede much ground. This means a stock wants to run higher.


Wingstop [scored a double beat back in May](https://www.investors.com/news/wingstop-shake-shack-q1-earnings-stock-buy-point/), and kept its full-year unit-growth outlook at 10%. Its full-year forecast was for "low single digit" domestic same-store sales growth.



Stock Of The Day Branches Out
-----------------------------


The company is also exploring new areas, such as a [home delivery partnership with DoorDash](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/finance/wingstop-soars-tech-innovations-continued-growth). The chicken-wing restaurant chain is using the alliance to test delivery to customers' front doors in Las Vegas, Chicago and Austin, Texas.


Wingstop stock boasts a solid, but not ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 85, which means it is in the top 15% of stocks tracked. Its Relative Strength Rating, which scores a stock's price performance over the last 12 months, is a more impressive 94.


Wingstop earnings have topped views for the past six quarters. Wingstop stock has a muscular three-year EPS growth rate of 27%.

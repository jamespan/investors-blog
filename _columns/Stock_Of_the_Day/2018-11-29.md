**Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) is the IBD Stock of the Day, with this month's midterm election results and accelerating earnings and revenue growth driving the Medicaid health insurer's shares higher. Centene stock was up slightly Thursday, nearing a new buy point.




Shares are in a consolidation going back to September with a 148.34 buy point. Shares reclaimed their 50-day line on Wednesday, indicating solid investor support. Centene stock has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/).


The relative strength line is also just off record highs. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Stocks holding up in a troubled market could emerge as leaders when investors' optimism returns.


Centene stock climbed 0.8% to 141.94 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). Molina stock was up 4%, moving back above its 50-day line. **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) also focuses on Medicaid managed care. Industry giant **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) rose 0.6%, hitting a new high as the Dow Jones stock rallies for a fifth straight session.


Centene Earnings, Sales Growth Pick Up
--------------------------------------


Revenue growth has accelerated for the past three quarters. Centene earnings per share jumped 33% in the third quarter, picking up from 13% in Q2.


However, Centene stock fell nearly 5% on Oct. 23 on its Q3 report, then kept retreating until finding support at its 200-day line on Oct. 29, when the S&P 500 index hit a low.


Election Results: Centene Stock Wins
------------------------------------


Centene provides health care services to government health programs. November's midterm election results bode well for Centene. Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah will [likely expand membership in Medicaid managed care](https://www.investors.com/news/humana-earnings-humana-stock-election-results-lift-health-insurers/).


With the Democrats retaking control of the House , the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature health law that Republicans have long tried to repeal, is likelier to endure. That preserves the Medicaid expansion and the ObamaCare exchanges, another area where Centene has gained customers. A Democrat-led House is also likelier to resist health spending cuts.


Centene Earnings Get Fidelis Boost
----------------------------------


Centene earnings, Zacks said, "have been supported by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, expansion in new programs in many of its states," and other acquisitions.


The company closed its $3.75 billion acquisition of New York insurer Fidelis Care in July. Fidelis offers health insurance via Medicaid, Medicare and other programs and had more than 1.6 million members as of last June.


As of the third quarter, Centene got about 80% of its total sales from its managed care segment, according to Zacks analysts. That division offers coverage through Medicaid and other government-backed programs.

**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as strong earnings and weaker political risks put shares in a buy zone Wednesday with another entry point also near.




The positive earnings report from the Dow Jones Industrial Average component also helped fuel a rally in managed care stocks. Just two days earlier, managed care stocks including UnitedHealth, **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)) and **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) had sold off, seemingly on an unexpected bout of "Medicare for All" nerves. That came as Bernie Sanders' odds of winning the Democratic nomination pulled nearly even with Joe Biden's in betting markets.


UnitedHealth Earnings
---------------------


UnitedHealth's fourth-quarter earnings rose 19% to $3.90 a share, 12 cents ahead of estimates. Total revenue climbed 4.3% to $60.9 billion, just below estimates of $60.98. The company's Optum health-services arm saw 8% revenue growth to $29.8 billion.


Management reiterated 2020 EPS guidance issued at its Dec. 2 investor day: $16.25-$16.55. Going into Q4 earnings, analysts expected UnitedHealth earnings per share of $16.45 this year. That would represent 8.9% growth vs. 2019 results.


CEO David Wichmann touted the company's latest Medicare Advantage enrollment period as its "strongest ever." He said its Medicare Advantage offerings, including growth of the dual-eligible population served by both Medicaid and Medicare, would serve 700,000 more people in 2020, toward the upper-end of December's guidance.

BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said the comfortable EPS beat came despite a higher-than-anticipated tax rate. He also cited a better-than-expected 82.5% medical cost ratio and rising health plan reserves as among the positives. But he did note that higher operating costs partly offset the lower medical costs as a share of premiums.


UnitedHealth's model aims to contain health costs for its managed care arm, partly by insourcing health services to its own cost-efficient locations. The company expects long-term EPS growth of 13% to 16%.


CFRA analyst Colin Scarola hiked his price target on UnitedHealth stock to 352 from 338 and upgraded his rating to strong buy from buy. He wrote that the marriage of UnitedHealth's managed care and services arms "affords competitive advantages for both segments."



UnitedHealth Stock Analysis
---------------------------


UNH stock climbed 2.8% to close at 296.41 in above-average volume Wednesday, helping lift the overall Dow Jones index. That's just below the all-time intraday high of 300 touched on Dec. 20.


UnitedHealth stock has been on a roll since investors rushed back into the managed care sector on the strength of the Dow component's Q3 earnings. UnitedHealth went on to a 36% gain over 10 weeks. But it took just over a year for UNH to eclipse its December 2018 peak of 287.94.


As political risk seemed to spike for the managed care group following the Democrats' House takeover in November 2018, UnitedHealth stock entered a long consolidation starting January 2019. UNH stock fell as much as 28%, bottoming in mid-April.


The stock finally cleared a 272.59 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) the week of Nov. 15. Shares have since climbed above the 5% chase zone, which maxed out at 293.57. However, UnitedHealth's stock chart offers two other potential buying opportunities.


A weekly chart shows that UnitedHealth rebounded bullishly after testing its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) earlier this week. After a breakout, the first or second test of support at the 10-week line followed by a robust rebound is considered a buy signal.


But a second potential buying opportunity is looming. A push through resistance at the 300 intraday high could offer a further chance to add shares.


2020 Election Risks: Diminished, But Not Forgotten
--------------------------------------------------


The recovery for UnitedHealth stock and the managed care group gathered steam as Warren's path to the Democratic nomination seemed to run into a wall after she released a $20.5 trillion tax plan on Nov. 1 to pay for Medicare for All.


Since then, she has not too subtly backed away from her idea, saying Medicare for All would wait for her third year in office. First, she'll focus on expanding coverage and implementing a public option. On the campaign trail, she emphasizes that Americans would have a choice between public and private insurance.


In addition to Warren's retreat, which seems to confirm that Medicare for All is a pipe dream, other political risks have receded. The White House abandoned a plan to target prescription benefit managers such as UnitedHealth's OptumRx and **CVS Caremark** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)). Then President Donald Trump rejected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's legislation enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices.


Meanwhile, Trump's reelection prospects have brightened. The January IBD/TIPP Poll showed Trump trails Joe Biden by just 2 points, within the margin of error. If the economy keeps its momentum, as seems likely, Trump's prospects may continue to improve.


So what is there to worry about? Trump remains unpopular. Despite the advantage of incumbency, the election may be close. While Medicare for All isn't a real risk, other health care reforms with a more realistic shot could prove disruptive. And even if Democrats don't retake the Senate, and can't pass sweeping legislation, the regulatory power of the president over managed care companies and stocks shouldn't be underestimated.

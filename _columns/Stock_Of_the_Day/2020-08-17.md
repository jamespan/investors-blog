**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the e-commerce giant has developed a new flat base that is closing in on a buy point.




Amazon is showing a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The new formation portends a buy point of 3,344.39, or 10 cents above its July 13 high. An aggressive entry at 3,247.57 is also available. Shares have found resistance around the 3,247 price level three times since July 21. A surge above that resistance area could lead to new price highs.


Amazon stock climbed 1.1% to close at 3,182.41 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The company has demonstrated a resistance to Covid-19. As the infection rate of the coronavirus spread — shutting down businesses and forcing consumers to shelter at home — Amazon was well-positioned to benefit in the shifts in consumer behaviors and equally significant shifts in how companies conduct business.

However, due to the overall impact of Covid-19, Amazon recently [postponed Prime Day](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-prime-day-officially-postponed-due-to-coronavirus-impact/) to sometime later this year. It's a two-day sales event that pulls in huge sales. It's been postponed as Amazon currently struggles to keep up with demand.


Since hitting a one-year low on March 16, a time when pandemic fears bashed the markets, Amazon stock has nearly doubled.


Multiple Business Units Propel Amazon Stock
-------------------------------------------


The company has multiple business units that should bring robust revenue growth and rising profit margins over the next several years.


The company reported [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/will-amazon-earnings-report-support-the-stocks-sizzling-growth/) on July 30 that blew past Wall Street estimates. Adjusted earnings of $10.30 per share jumped 97% from the year-ago period, smashing expectations of $1.48.


Earnings powered above estimates even though it spent $4 billion during the quarter on coronavirus-related costs as previously announced. In addition, the company plowed more than $9 billion into capital projects, including fulfillment, transportation and Amazon Web Services.


Revenue soared 40% to $88.9 billion, comfortably above estimates of $81.4 billion. That was its strongest revenue growth in nine quarters.


Among its various business units, Amazon said it increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 160% and tripled grocery pickup locations. Online grocery sales tripled in the second quarter when compared with the same period last year.


Revenue from its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, rose 29% to $10.8 billion.


Third-Quarter Revenue Outlook Above Estimates
---------------------------------------------


The company provided third-quarter revenue guidance of $87 billion to $93 billion. That was above analyst estimates at $86.4 billion and representing growth of about 29% at the midpoint.


The resulting tidal wave of new demand for household and home office supplies has created bottlenecks and shortages, which Amazon has addressed.


In order to fulfill spiking demand, Amazon hired [100,000 additional workers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-plans-to-hire-100000-raise-wages-to-address-coronavirus-impact/) and then added [another 75,000 workers](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/amazons-actions-to-help-employees-communities-and-customers-affected-by-covid-19?utm_source=gcaweb&utm_medium=prweb&utm_content=COVID-19_roundup).


Last month, Amazon expanded its push into self-driving vehicle technology when it announced [plans to acquire Zoox](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-vehicles/), a six-year-old startup, for an undisclosed amount. Reports said Amazon paid more than $1.2 billion.


Amazon Has Strong IBD Composite Rating
--------------------------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows that Amazon stock has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Amazon stock currently outperforms 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


It also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 92, which measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months against that of all other stocks.


It has a healthy [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1) of 93, which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth with all other stocks.


The company currently holds the No. 1 spot among its peers in IBD's Retail/Internet industry group. It's followed by **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) then **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).

A pullback for airline stocks has positioned **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) for a possible rebound. That gives investors a couple of clear entries to Delta Air stock, Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




Airlines turned in a powerful advance, rising 47% from mid-March to late July. Fuel costs, potential union strikes and concerns over China's economy all challenged investor confidence data showing the industry was recovering to pre-pandemic travel levels.


The 20-stock group pulled back almost unanimously. Delta and **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) dropped 11%. **American Airlines Group** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) fell almost 18%. Domestic players also took their licks.


The holdout was tiny **SkyWest** ([SKYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKYW)), rising 8% in July as the others fell, adding a third straight monthly advance. On Monday, SkyWest shares traded up 161% since the start of the year.

Delta Air Executes Picture-Perfect Pullback
-------------------------------------------


Delta Air sat on a year-to-date gain of nearly 36% Monday. That slightly lagged United's 40% tally, but easily topped American's 24% advance.


But looking at its charts, Delta Air stock never touched its 50-day line, finding support at its 10-week line. Shares never came close to a prior bottoming-base buy point of 40.30. Volume was below average.


American's pullback cut well below its 10-week moving average. United also undercut that key level of technical support, though not by much. Both undercut bottoming-base buy points.


United's share price had eased to its 10-week level. On a daily chart, [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) shows UAL stock moving back above its 50-day line.



That suggests institutions are holding on, or even stepping in to buy at that 50-day/10-week level. This is why it is considered a level of technical support. And it suggests the stock may well be primed for a jump when more buyers step in.


Charting Delta Stock's Buy Points
---------------------------------


So if Delta shares overtake Monday's intraday high of 45.42, they're fair game for investors. That [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) would get a little reinforcement if the stock powers past its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which currently hangs at about the 45.77 level.


While [buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/) for most bases extend 5% above their buy point, rebounds get a 10% entry margin. That would make Delta in season through 49.97. Those a little more bold could maybe chase shares through 50.34 â€” 10% above the 21-day level.


Delta Air earnings growth averaged 296% over the past four quarters, slowing to a still impressive 86% gain in Q2. Revenue growth averaged 36%, slowing in the second quarter to a 13% increase.


It gets IBD's [No. 2 ranking](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-delta-air-lines-dal.aspx) among the stocks in the Transportation-Airline industry group. Panamanian airline **Copa Holdings** ([CPA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPA)) holds the top ranking. It reports second-quarter results Aug. 10.

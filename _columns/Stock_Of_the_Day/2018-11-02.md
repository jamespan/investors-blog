**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), breaking out of a long consolidation after reporting strong fiscal fourth-quarter results and a U.S. same-store sales revival.




Starbucks Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------


Shares gapped higher, rising 9.7% to 64.32 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), clearing a 62.04 buy point from a nine-month, first-stage consolidation. Starbucks stock hit a record 65.68 intraday. Shares had been moving sideways since 2015, so Friday's move can be seen as clearing a three-year consolidation.


During that long coffee break, Starbucks earnings kept rising in the double digits every quarter.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is now at a 15-month best after lagging for several years.


Starbucks stock is currently on track for its best weekly gain since 2012.


Early last month, Starbucks stock got a boost when activist investor Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital disclosed a [$900 million stake](https://www.investors.com/news/starbucks-stock-bill-ackman-pershing-square-stake/).



Starbucks Earnings
------------------


Starbucks earnings rose 13% to 62 cents a share on revenue of $6.3 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research had expected Starbucks earnings per share to rise 7% to 59 cents on 9% revenue growth to $6.2 billion.


Comps rose 3% globally, powered by 3% growth in average tickets.


After lackluster U.S. comparable sales gains of 2%, 1% and 2% in the prior three quarters, Starbucks recorded a 4% U.S. gain and beat estimates across the board.


The overall comps included 4% growth in the Americas and U.S., a 1% rise in China-Asia Pacific and 2% growth in its Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. That beats Consensus Metrix projections for 2.2% global same-store sales growth, including 2.8% comps in the Americas market.

Starbucks stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94 out of 99.


Starbucks Touts China Growth, Delivery Push
-------------------------------------------


Management said China, its fastest-growing market, drove double-digit total transaction growth. Starbucks announced in August a retail partnership with Chinese commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) that includes Starbucks delivery in Beijing, Shanghai and 30 cities in China by the end of 2018.


Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said on the earnings call that he is "very optimistic" about Starbucks delivery in China, adding that it will be "delivery unlike any other competitor is doing in the market." The company, which has also tested delivery in Miami, will share more details on their investor day on Dec. 13 in New York City.


"We continue to believe (same-store sales) growth could inflect in FY19 with the rollout of delivery to (more than) 2000 units by the end of the calendar year," wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan of the rollout in China, a key growth market. "Nevertheless, we remain cautious with respect to the transient nature of both nascent competition and cannibalization from accelerated unit growth."


Starbucks Earnings Guidance
---------------------------


For 2019, Starbucks expects $2.61-$2.66 in per-share earnings and consolidated revenue growth of 5%-7%. The midpoint of that outlook beats current analyst views for $2.62 per share and 5% sales growth.


My Starbucks Rewards now has 15.3 million members as of the end of the quarter, marking 15% year-over-year growth. Loyalty members account for almost 40% of tender in the U.S., said Starbucks COO Rosalind Brewer on the earnings call, calling it the "strongest growth rate in seven quarters."


The Starbucks earnings report also comes after **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) reported strong results and announced plans to drop the word "Donuts" from its stores as it looks to take more market share away from Starbucks in coffee.


Dunkin' rose 0.5% to 72.11 Thursday. Dunkin' stock is consolidating in a flat base just below its 50-day line.

**Credo Technology Group** ([CRDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRDO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares rebound off their 21-day exponential moving average.




A supplier of high-speed connectivity products for internet data centers, Credo in January pulled off one of this year's rare technology initial public offerings. Credo's products help speed up communications among racks of computer servers and storage devices packed into data centers.


Credo's products also are built into 5G wireless infrastructure equipment. Its biggest customers are big technology companies that operate so-called "hyperscale" data centers. They're designed to ratchet up computing horsepower when demand surges.


Stifel initiated coverage of Credo in February.


In a note to clients, Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg said: "Credo is in the early innings of a large and fast-growing market opportunity, driven by multiple product ramps, including its SerDes (serializer/deserializer 'chiplets'), optical digital signal processors, line-card physical layer devices, and 'Hi-Wire' active electrical cables."


Copper Interconnect Cables A Growth Driver
------------------------------------------


Credo's copper interconnect cables operate at 100 gigabytes per second, 200G, 400G, and 800G speeds.


The active cabling targets the deployment of next-generation server platforms coming from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)).


Craig-Hallum analyst Richard Shannon says **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is Credo's initial customer for the active electrical cables.


"Recent market research suggests (active electrical cable) adoption on a per-server level could approach 75% in a few years, suggesting strong growth potential for many years," Shannon said in his note to clients.


CRDO Stock: Next-Generation Data Center Bandwidth
-------------------------------------------------


Mizuho Securities expects Credo to take market share.


"Credo's (cables) drive 50% to 70% lower switch/cable power consumption, 50% lower silicon footprint, and compact cabling with tight bend radius enabling greater rack density," Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a note.


In fiscal 2023, Credo has targeted revenue of $200 million, up 88%.


In a September report, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said: "Despite the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and a more challenging cloud capital spending outlook, we continue to believe that Credo's strategic role in enabling next-generation bandwidth needs in a cost- and power-effective envelope as well as the company's idiosyncratic design wins will support a robust growth trajectory."

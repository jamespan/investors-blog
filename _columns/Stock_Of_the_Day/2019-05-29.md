**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it finds support at its 10-week line amid an ongoing stock market correction.With its strong fundamentals and excellent technical performance, Mastercard stock is one to watch for when a new market uptrend takes hold, along with several other payment stocks.




Even though the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/what-is-the-stock-market-how-does-the-stock-market-work/) is in correction, don't just sit on the sidelines. It's time to build up watch lists with potential investments.


Payment stocks are holding up better than almost any other group, with [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock Mastercard leading the way. Other good candidates include archrival **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and digital payments leader **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)). So are **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)). They are currently near buy points or new highs.


Mastercard Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------------


The credit card giant rose 13 cents to 253.56 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Mastercard stock is currently in profit-taking zone after breaking out from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) on Jan. 31, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Shares are up 34% so far in 2019.



Mastercard stock has been consolidating throughout May, moving sideways and finding support at its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/10-week-moving-average-serves-multiple-purposes/). A rebound from this technical benchmark, the weekly chart counterpart to the 50-day moving average, could offer an opportunity for existing holders to add shares or aggressive investors to step in.


However, investors should largely avoid new buys in the current stock market correction.

With Mastercard stock holding steady while the major averages retreat, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been hitting new highs, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provide, has been on an almost continuous uptrend since the start of 2011.



Mastercard stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 98, which puts it in the top 2% of stocks tracked. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mastercard-inc-cl-a-ma.aspx) shows its strong fundamentals are key to its high rating, with Mastercard earnings growing by an average 29% over the last three quarters. EPS has also grown by the same amount over the last three years, during which revenue grew by 17%.


Several trends are benefiting payment stocks. Chief among these is the increasing use of electronic payments over cash and checks. While this process has been underway for some time on the consumer front, [business-to-business is set for rapid growth](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/). Mobile payments are also seen as an ongoing driver of growth.


Last September, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider said the Mastercard stock will benefit from increasing share in the "underpenetrated" European market, which could boost Mastercard earnings. He also believes it is perfectly poised to lead in the B2B market, which is seen as [offering a $1 trillion opportunity for payment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/?preview_id=3729964).


Other Payment Stocks Fly High
-----------------------------


The overall Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors is rated No. 9 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, and


Visa stock slid 0.6% to 162.73 Wednesday. Dow Jones stock looks a lot like rival Mastercard. Visa stock has been making serene progress in 2019, and has been receiving support at its 10-week line. Its relative strength line is also at record highs. Visa stock has Composite Rating of 98. Visa earnings are very strong, with EPS growing by 25% over the past three years.



Among other top payment stocks, [PayPal stock](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) is also finding support at its 10-week line, with its RS line at highs. PayPal fell 1.5% to 110.08 on Wednesday. Its focus on digital payments has helped it become a leader, and PayPal gave [analysts an upbeat view for growing revenue from Venmo](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-earnings-pypl-stock-q1-2019-venmo/), its person-to-person mobile payment service, when it reported earnings last month. PayPal stock has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99.


Meanwhile Brazilian payments stock PagSeguro Digital stock retreated 1.7% to 32.24, holding above a 31.74 buy point after sinking to 31.31 intraday. Shares cleared a  [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) cleared last week, but in low volume. PagSeguro stock did surge 18% in heavy volume in the two days after earnings, nearly reaching the 31.74 entry on May 16. It also has a Composite Rating of 99, and its mammoth 71% gain in 2019 has seen it take the lead in the competitive [Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-may-28-2019/).


Finally Euronet Worldwide stock is extended after getting support at 10-week line. The former [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) operates a lucrative network of ATMs, mostly located in Europe and India, and is continuing to expand into other overseas markets. It has a Composite Rating of 97. Euronet Worldwide stock sank 1.35% to 155.91.

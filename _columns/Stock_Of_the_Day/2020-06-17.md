Alteryx Stock: Long Period Of Double-Digit Growth
-------------------------------------------------


Revenue in the first quarter jumped 43% from the year-ago period to $108.8 million. The company has posted double-digit revenue growth per quarter going back more than four years.


However, it missed quarterly revenue estimates, mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused "an abrupt and significant change in customer buying behavior late in the quarter," Chief Executive Dean Stoecker told analysts in a conference call after its [first-quarter earnings report](https://investor.alteryx.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alteryx-Announces-First-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx).


It lost 10-cents per share in the quarter, vs. a 4-cent profit a year earlier. But it was profitable in the prior 10 quarters. The company has pulled full-year 2020 guidance.


"We are in an unprecedented time and there is much that is unknown," Stoecker said in the conference call. "What we do know is that leveraging data and analytics is equally, if not more, important in uncertain times."


Offers Second-Quarter Projections
---------------------------------


The company did provide guidance for the second quarter, however.


Alteryx expects revenue in the range of $91 million to $95 million, an increase of 10% to 15%. That was below analyst estimates and would be its slowest growth in more than four years. It expects an adjusted loss in the range of 12 cents to 18 cents per share.


The massive volumes of information generated and used for decision making in business today fuel the booming business of data analytics and Big Data companies. The application of data analytics affects organizations across practically every industry and takes an active part in developing strategies for their success.


"The need for a data driven culture has never been greater," Stoecker said. "We are confident the Alteryx platform can help organizations unify the data, analytic processes and people to see success in digital transformation."

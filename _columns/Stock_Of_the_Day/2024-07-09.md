Howmet Aerospace is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday. HWM stock flashed a buy signal as it rebounds back toward record highs.




Pittsburgh-based **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)) provides engine components and metal parts for the defense, aerospace and transportation industries. Its products include airfoils, rings, forgings and alloys for aero engine and industrial gas turbines, as well as titanium ingots, fastening systems and forged wheels. Among its key customers, Howmet supplies various bulkheads for the **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) F-35 Lightning II, which forms the structure of the jet. It also manufactures the fan blades for **RTX's** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)) Pratt & Whitney PurePower Geared Turbofan Engine. The PurePower engine is utilized by high-volume commercial aircraft, such as the **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)) A320neo.


Meanwhile, Howmet Aerospace has reported strong fundamentals this year amid a recovering commercial aerospace market and a rebound in air travel.


The company's quarterly earnings increases ranged from 26% to 36% gain over the last four quarters, on 14% to 18% revenue growth.


For its Q1 results reported May 2, [Howmet delivered a 36% earnings increase](https://www.investors.com/news/howmet-aerospace-stock-breakout-q1-results-guidance/) to 57 cents per share. Revenue jumped 14% year-over-year to a record $1.82 billion, driven by a 23% increase in commercial aerospace sales. Free cash flow came out to $95 million for the quarter, which marked the first time Howmet achieved positive cash flow in a Q1 period.


The results beat FactSet earnings expectations of 52 cents per share on $1.74 billion in revenue.


Howmet also hiked its 2024 earnings outlook to range from $2.31 to $2.39 per share, up from its previous outlook of $2.10 to $2.20. It now forecasts revenue to range from $7.225 billion to $7.375 billion, increased from $7 billion to $7.2 billion. The guidance boost was ahead of FactSet estimates of a 20% earnings increase to $2.21 per share on 7.6% sales growth to $7.14 billion.


The company plans to boost its third-quarter dividend by 40% to 7 cents per share. Howmet on Feb. 26 paid a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share.

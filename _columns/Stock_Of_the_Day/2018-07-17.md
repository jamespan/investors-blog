**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), amid a retail rally that now appears to be extending through the summer.




The parent of Anthropologie, Free People, Bhldn and its flagship namesake stores, Urban Outfitters has built an apparel and accessories brand that appeals to millennials and teens. The company also owns a number of restaurants through its Vetri Family arm.


Urban Outfitters Stock, Earnings
--------------------------------


After a rocky 2017 that saw shares sink as low as the 16 price level, Urban Outfitters stock is now nearly triple that, hitting a new high of 48.24 in mid-June.


Shares took a little knock on July 12, thanks to [disappointing quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-american-eagle-stock-urban-outfitters-stock-peers-miss-sales/) from **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)) and **Buckle** ([BKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKE)), sending Urban Outfitters stock briefly below its 50-day moving average intraday.


But Urban Outfitters stock has since found support at the 50-day and [10-week lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/10-week-moving-average-serves-multiple-purposes/). Its weekly chart offers a look at a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) that's forming with a 48.34 entry point.


Urban Outfitters stock rose 3.2% to 45.92 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It's a solid share price rebound from the 50-day line, but the below-average volume rules it out as a buying opportunity.


Urban'sÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is now at levels last seen in late 2016, with a Relative Strength Rating of 96.


The last three quarters have been marked by accelerating earnings and sales growth, with profit rising 3%, 21% then 280% from the prior-year quarters.


The company has now topped analyst expectations for the last four quarters on both the top and bottom lines.

Retail Sector Stocks Rallying
-----------------------------


Peer **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)), another brand that caters to millennials and teens, is also having a good year. That stock is also finding support at its 50-day line after getting shaken up last week, and has mostly kept abreast of the key level.


American Eagle Outfitters stock rallied 2.6% to 23.85 on Tuesday, also rebounding from its 50-day line in light volume.


Urban Outfitters currently ranks No. 6 in IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group. **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) [leads the pack](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/apparel-retailer-lululemon/), buoyed most recently by a 16.3% single-session stock spike after a well-received earnings report in late May.

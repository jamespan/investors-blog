It's a pretty safe bet that many of the global efforts to find coronavirus treatments and vaccines run through the syringes and vials made by midsize **West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), based in Exton, Pa., which has helped WST stock of late.




And while you might well have not heard of West Pharma, it's also a solid wager that many of those frantically working to end the global Covid-19 pandemic have.


"The pandemic remains our priority," West Pharma Chief Executive Eric Green said on the company's recent second-quarter earnings conference call. "Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in vaccine development.


"We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale-up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates."

Its work boosted WST stock to an all-time high of 288.65 on Sept. 2. WST stock climbed 1% to close at 275.38 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The company provides products and services designed to help its customers deliver safe and effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently. It calls itself a leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines.


WST Stock Rises Along With Profit, Sales Growth
-----------------------------------------------


West Pharma doesn't identify its customers but says they include the leading biologic, generic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and additional medical device companies in the world. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of revenue. The company says its 10 largest customers accounted for 44.3% of 2019 sales.


In July, West Pharma posted its biggest year-over-year gains in earnings and sales in at least the past 18 quarters. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 40% to $1.25. Sales rose 12% to $527.2 million. According to Zacks, both results handily beat analyst expectations.


Moreover, the company hiked its full-year outlook. West Pharma expects adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.25. That's up from its earlier estimate of $3.52 to $3.62. At the midpoint, profit would rise 30%. That would be its biggest bottom-line jump since 2006.


The company now expects sales of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion, up from its earlier estimate of $1.95 billion-$1.97 billion. At the midpoint, sales would rise 11%, its biggest gain since 2007.


Revenue growth is both related to coronavirus treatments, and non-Covid-related, William Blair analyst John Kreger said in a research note at the time. He maintains an outperform rating on WST stock.


Coronavirus Treatment Helps, But No Vaccines Yet
------------------------------------------------


The big jump last quarter actually came with little help from coronavirus vaccine makers, Kreger said in a recent note.


"The Covid-19-related work at present is mainly in the therapeutic area, and the company has seen little to no impact as of yet from vaccine," Kreger wrote. He said the company could see "material" upside from vaccine-related sales starting early in 2021, though he also pointed out there is a lot of uncertainty.


In a post-earnings research note, Jefferies analyst David Windley said West Pharma is well-positioned for the oncoming rush of demand for Covid products. He said West Pharma has weathered the Covid pandemic well.


"It has sustained growth in its core business and layered Covid work on top of that, evidenced by its clean beat-and-raise results," wrote Windley. But he rates WST stock a hold on its high valuation.


'Underlying Demand Growth' Seen In Business
-------------------------------------------


In the July earnings release, CEO Green said, "We continue to see underlying demand growth in our existing business for our high-value products and in high adoption rates from customers who are developing therapeutics and vaccines to address the Covid-19 pandemic."


In its March 25 proxy statement, West Pharma said it was issued more than 150 patents in 2019 alone, which it said shows it is "making good progress to develop and deliver the next generation of packaging and drug delivery advancements that will drive our future growth."


WST stock tested its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) last week but has bounced above the key support metric. WST stock has formed a four-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point of 279.64.

PVH stockÂ is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it breaks out on earnings, with the owner of iconic American apparel brands recovering from the pandemic on strong international growth.




**PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)), formerly Phillips-Van Heusen, owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. On Tuesday, the leading global apparel company hiked its outlook for the full year after crushing Q2 earnings estimates.


Analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse raised their price targets on PVH stock after the beat-and-raise report. Credit Suisse has an outperform rating on the stock.


For Q2, PVH posted earnings of $2.72 per share, beating estimates by $1.52. Revenue jumped 46% to $2.31 billion, driven by sales in Europe. Analysts were expecting $2.14 billion. In the year-ago quarter, PVH earnings and revenue plunged, with virtually all of its stores closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.


The Tommy Hilfiger brand grew 41% year over year. The Calvin Klein brand grew 56%, and Heritage Brands grew 37%.


Digital revenue grew 35% in Q2. Digital sales made up a quarter of total revenue.


"Our international performance was particularly strong, which performed above 2019 pre-pandemic levels," CEO Stefan Larsson said in a statement.


"Looking ahead, we are pleased with our recovery, which has been faster than expected across both global brands," he added. But North American sales are expected to remain challenging, he said.


Still, the company raised its full-year outlook, despite Covid uncertainty. It expects revenue to increase 26%-28% vs. 2020, up from a prior view for a 22%-24% gain. It forecasts EPS of $8.50 vs. a loss of $1.97 in 2020, up from a prior view for EPS of $6.50.

PVH Stock
---------


Shares gapped up 15.1% to close at 120.58 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). PVH stock topped a 116.79 cup-with-handle buy point, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The buy zone extends to 122.63.


Shares are also bouncing back above their 50-day line after dipping below it Tuesday.


The relative strength line for PVH stock is rising but still below the consolidation peak. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.


PVH's efforts to streamline operations and pursue higher-growth opportunities are paying off. In August, the fashion company completed the sale of its Heritage Brands, which includes Izod, Van Heusen and Arrow, to focus on its higher-return businesses. Earlier in April 2020, it sold the Speedo brand.


International markets are another key strategic priority. PVH says that focus is helping it win in the apparel marketplace, "supercharged by e-commerce" growth.


However, a string of recent earnings and revenue declines weigh on key IBD ratings for PVH stock. It earns an EPS Rating of 70 out of 99 and a Composite Rating of just 65 out of 99.

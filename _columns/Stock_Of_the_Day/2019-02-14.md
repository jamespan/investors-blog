Specialty chemicals and materials manufacturer **Ingevity** ([NGVT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NGVT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Ingevity earnings more than doubled, sending Ingevity stock soaring past a buy zone to a record high on Thursday.




Based in North Carolina, Ingevity produces a variety of carbon materials and specialty chemicals. It carries a range of proprietary formulated products. It came public in May 2016.


Ingevity Earnings
-----------------


Ingevity earnings per share surged 138% to $1.07, the company reported late Wednesday. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected 78 cents. Revenue also bested views, jumping 21% to $279 million. Those were the best year-over-year gains in several years.


"In what is seasonally a slower quarter, we realized higher volumes and improved price and mix. Our profitability was additionally aided by lower raw materials costs," Ingevity CEO Michael Wilson said. "These positives were partially offset by higher freight and distribution costs, higher spending related to plant outages and increased legal expenses."


Ingevity sees 2019 revenue of $1.30 billion to $1.36 billion vs. analyst views for $1.233 billion.

**Ingevity** Stock Explodes
---------------------------


Shares shot up 11% to close at 107.87 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) in massive volume. Ingevity stock surged past a 104.92 buy point from a 21-week double bottom base, [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows.


The [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) is shaped like the letter W. An important distinction is that the second leg down should undercut the first. IBD founder William O'Neil, says the undercut of the second leg - even by just a penny - is a necessary shakeout as a final purge of weak holders before the stock can advance.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) jumped to a record high along with the stock. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ingevity-corporation-ngvt.aspx) further bolsters the security's case. It has a very good, but not quite ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 92. And while its EPS Rating of 69 is mediocre, it has an excellent average EPS growth rate of 72% over the past three quarters.


Its 3-year EPS growth rate of 27% is also excellent. Ingevity stock is also seeing rising institutional ownership. This is important, as the I in [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) stands for Institutional Sponsorship.

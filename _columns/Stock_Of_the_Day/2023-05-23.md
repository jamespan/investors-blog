**Alamos Gold** ([AGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday. Gold stocks are pulling back alongside gold prices after surging on bank crisis concerns, presenting a potential entry for Alamos. Alamos Gold stock joined IBD's [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) roster on Tuesday.




Canadian-based Alamos Gold operates three mines across North America with more than 1,900 employees. Alamos produced 457,200 ounces of gold last year and is ramping up operations.


The company released a shining Q1 earnings beat in late April. Revenue spiked 36% to a quarterly-record $251.5 million to mark thee quarters of accelerating sales. Earnings climbed to 12 cents per share from 5 cents in 2022. Gold production surged 30% year over year to 128,400 ounces in the first-quarter and the company forecasts producing 480,000 to 520,000 ounces this year.


Gold Price
----------


Gold-mining stocks tend to rise or fall with the price of gold, but their moves are more dramatic. Extended moves above or below a miner's cost of production can either charge or extinguish profitability.


Gold stocks and gold-related shares have pulled back as the dollar strengthened and Treasury yields rebounded. Gold prices retreated this month to $1,973 per ounce on Tuesday, down from a near-record high at almost $2,050 per ounce on May 4. Gold hit its record high, above $2,067 an ounce, in August 2020.


Gold is a safe haven, an asset in which investors harbor cash during periods of economy uncertainty. Therefore, gold prices bolted higher in March during the string of bank failures as investors flocked to perceived safe haven assets. Spot gold prices briefly eclipsed $2,000 per ounce in late March after trading around $1,813 on March 8 prior to Silicon Valley Bank's failure.


The U.S. dollar index DXY edged up 0.4% Tuesday, and is up 1.7% over the past month. Still, the index is flat year to date. Meanwhile, 10-year Treasury yields rose the past week to hover near two-month highs as investors backed out of bonds.


The approaching June 1 debt-ceiling deadline is giving investors cause to seek safe havens, including gold or gold mining stocks. The last time the government flirted with default in the summer of 2011, gold prices surged to a then-record $1,920 an ounce.

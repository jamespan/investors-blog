Artisan Partners Asset Management is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Milwaukee-based active-investment fund manager continues to ride momentum after a stellar 2020. On Thursday, APAM stock cleared a buy point from a 13-week consolidation, hitting its highest level since 2014.




Last month, IBD recognized the **Artisan Small Cap Investor** ([ARTSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARTSX)) fund as No. 5 among the Best Small-Cap Funds, based on a 10-year average annual return of 18.66%. That included a lofty 61% return in 2020.


In all, 10 Artisan funds were recognized for beating their benchmark in all four periods examined: one year, three years, five years and 10 years through the end of 2020.


Artisan Stock
-------------


Artisan stock rose 5% on Thursday to 56.56 clearing a 55.35 buy point from a 13-week consolidation, according to a [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The breakout came on heavy volume, indicating institutional buying.


APAM stock had rallied as high as 55.25 on Jan. 14. That came just after Artisan Partners announced its year-end total for assets under management of $157.8 billion, up from $134.3 million at the end of September.



Artisan's relative strength line is still a bit below its January high, meaning it has slightly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent months. Asset managers are getting some renewed attention, helped by a strong earnings report from industry giant **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)).


APAM stock has a strong 98 IBD Composite Rating, outperforming 98% of all stocks. That combines technical and fundamental factors into a single rating. The biggest stock market winners often have an IBD Composite Rating of 95 or higher before they make their big moves.


Artisan earnings and sales growth has accelerated for the past two quarters, to 41% and 25%, respectively, in the latest quarter.


Artisan Business Trends
-----------------------


The asset manager says 16 of 17 strategies launched prior to 2020 have exceeded their benchmarks, after fees. In 2020, the firm generated $30 billion in investment returns, including $11.3 billion above benchmark.


That included $7 billion in net cash inflows, a notable change after net cash outflows in recent years. That reflected investors transitioning some cash out of Artisan's first-generation strategies. Now inflows to new funds have overtaken outflows.


In Q1, assets under management grew to $162.9 billion, up 3.2% in the quarter.


Artisan characterizes itself as a "high value-added investment firm," saying it stays away from fads and gives its managers a high degree of freedom.


In 2020, Artisan set up an investment group in China focused on post-venture investing. It focuses on disruptive, fast-growing public and private companies at an early stage of growth. The firm launched the Artisan China Post-Venture Strategy on March 1.

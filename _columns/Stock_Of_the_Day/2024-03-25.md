**Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chip design firm is seen benefiting from China's efforts to boost its use of domestic processors. Arm stock surged above a downward trendline on Monday.




The [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/7bf0f79b-dea7-49fa-8253-f678d5acd64a) reported Sunday that the Chinese government is looking to phase out **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **AMD** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) chips from its PCs and servers in favor of domestic alternatives.


"Arm could be a potential beneficiary of the new regulations given the likelihood that many of the alternative processors are based on Arm's architecture," Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said in a client note Monday.


In other Arm news, the Cambridge, U.K.-based firm last week announced a [partnership with Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-arm-team-up-power-startups.html#gs.6d5u2j) to help chip startups.


Together, the companies will provide essential intellectual property and manufacturing support, while also making financial assistance available, to foster innovation and growth for startups developing a range of devices built on Arm-based designs and manufactured by Intel Foundry.

Penumbra stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the medical technology company breaks out following a five-day run.




The [medical technology company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/) makes medical devices used to help patients experiencing a stroke or other vascular conditions. **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)) acknowledges a growing field of competitors, including the likes of **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) and **Stryker** ([SYK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYK)).


In the U.S., a growing number of medical technology companies are launching aspiration devices. These are vacuum-like devices that aim to remove a blood clot. Aspiration is growing in popularity. And Penumbra beat giants like Medtronic and Stryker to the market in 2014.


"Penumbra believes that competitors like Medtronic's entry into the aspiration field and ongoing conversation about aspiration will continue to help (lift) the overall aspiration market opportunity," Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a recent note to clients.

Penumbra Stock Enjoys Weeklong Streak
-------------------------------------


Shares of Penumbra climbed nearly 13% over the previous five sessions, and continued that sprint for a sixth outing on Monday. In midday action on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Penumbra [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) jumped 3%, near 165.60, though its [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/) remained below average. Shares surged above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 162.60 out of a [cup](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). The light volume was sign of weakness for the breakout, although volume sometimes picks up in the days after the breakout.


Biegelsen has an outperform rating and 180 price target on Penumbra stock.


The lion's share of Penumbra's revenue comes from medical devices that [treat strokes](https://www.penumbrainc.com/patients-caregivers/brain-conditions/). In this condition, a blood clot either originates in the brain or forms elsewhere in the body and travels to the brain through the bloodstream. This deprives the brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients.


In the [first quarter](https://investors.penumbrainc.com/investors-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Penumbra-Inc-Reports-First-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results/default.aspx) ended March 31, Penumbra brought in $81.47 million in sales of its devices to remove those blood clots. In constant currency, neurovascular sales rose 16.5%.


But its best growth comes from the medical technology company's efforts in [vascular conditions](https://www.penumbrainc.com/patients-caregivers/body-conditions/) like acute limb ischemia. This is a medical emergency in which blood flow to a limb decreases due to a blood clot. Penumbra's medical devices aim to remove the clot.



First-quarter sales of vascular devices popped 51.8% in constant currency to $49.97 million. The vascular market is much bigger than the 150,000 patients Penumbra is initially targeting with its [medical device called Indigo](https://www.penumbrainc.com/peripheral-device/indigo-system/), according to Biegelsen.


Competition In Medical Devices Drive Growth
-------------------------------------------


Penumbra estimates 60%-65% of stroke procedures in the U.S. use one of its medical devices — aspiration or stent retriever, Biegelsen said.


"Management believes that the increased competition is a positive because it reinforces Penumbra's long-standing view that aspiration first is the best treatment paradigm and more players are helping to grow the aspiration market faster," Biegelsen said.


Further, the medical technology company hopes to release "potentially transformational" new medical devices this year and next in stroke treatment, he said. The market outside the U.S. is also a significant opportunity, especially in China and Brazil.


On the vascular side, Penumbra's peripheral vascular business is underappreciated, J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a recent report. Marcus has an overweight rating and 170 price target on Penumbra stock.


Penumbra's Indigo system can remove blood clots from the arteries and veins in the peripheral vascular system. Today, that medical device is used in 10% of patients who have a blood clot in their peripheral vascular system, Biegelsen said.


"The peripheral business remains underappreciated, especially as it's poised to grow about 30% in 2019 and represents more than 35% of full-year revenues," Marcus said. In 2023, he expects peripheral vascular sales to be $404 million vs. $536 million in neurovascular sales.


Highly Rated Medical Technology Company
---------------------------------------


Penumbra stock has an Investor's Business Daily [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 91 out of a best-possible 99. The rating scores a company's key growth metrics against all other stocks. So Penumbra stock ranks in the top 9% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Shares also have a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 87 out of a total 99. The RS Rating pits a stock's 12-month performance against all others, putting Penumbra stock in the top 13%.

**Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as NVCR stock rebounds off its 10-week line and offers investors a buying opportunity.




Shares of the cancer treatment specialist are on a tear in 2020. On a year-to-date basis, NVCR stock had launched more than 44% as of Wednesday's close. This comes amid five quarters of triple-digit profit growth and years of quarterly sales growth. Shares climbed 2.9% to close at 125.26 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Even the coronavirus pandemic hasn't slowed NVCR stock. The company reported 44% sales growth in the third quarter. Executive Chairman William Doyle emphasizes that treatment for Novocure's patients isn't optional.


"These are deadly cancers that we're treating," he told Investor's Business Daily. These patients have "the worst possible medical diagnoses."

NVCR Stock Could Be A 2021 Story
--------------------------------


Novocure was founded in 2000 to test a theory that electrical fields could prevent cells from splitting, a process called mitosis. In cancer, mitosis occurs uncontrolled and, as a result, clumps of abnormal cells become tumors.


Its medical devices are body-worn bandages that transmit targeted electrical fields to disrupt cancer-driving cell division. So far, Novocure is approved to treat glioblastoma and mesothelioma, respectively cancers of the brain and lungs.


But the company isn't stopping there. In 2021, Novocure will unveil data from studies in cancers of the liver, lungs, stomach and ovaries. In 2022, analysts expect to see the results of a study testing the technology on brain cancer that migrated from the lungs.


Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar says NVCR stock is a 12-month idea.


"We'd recommend purchase for investors with that investment horizon as there are plenty of catalysts the next few years that keep us supportive," he said in a recent report to clients. Bednar has an overweight rating and 140 price target on NVCR stock.


Strong Sales, Earnings Growth
-----------------------------


Bullishly, NVCR stock aligns with [CAN SLIM rules for investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). The company just posted 350% growth in adjusted earnings to 9 cents per share. In the same period, sales popped 44% to $132.7 million.


Analysts polled by FactSet expect that trend to continue. This quarter, they call for the company to double its year-earlier earnings to 8 cents per share and for sales to rise by a third year over year to $131.8 million.



Those metrics show up in the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) for NVCR stock. Shares have a CR of 93 out of a best-possible 99. The score pits a stock's technical and fundamental metrics against all other stocks. On that bar, NVCR stock ranks in the top 7%.


Shares also have a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) — a measure of 12-month performance — of 93. *Keep tabs on [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital) for more stock ratings.*


NVCR Stock Appears Actionable
-----------------------------


Twice this year, NVCR stock has joined [Investor's Business Daily's Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Most recently, it joined the list on Nov. 4.


Shares are now getting solid support at their [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-why-the-10-week-line-offers-follow-on-buy-points/), putting NVCR stock in a follow-on buy zone from 114.77 to 126.25. On the daily chart, shares also are approaching a trend line. Investors could wait for NVCR stock to hurdle that level, around 126, before adding shares.


Yet another option: NVCR stock appears to be building the right side of a base, which would offer the savvy investor another [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) down the road.

Aerospace parts maker **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it closes in on a buy point after building a bullish base.




Defense stocks have been rising in recent months amid escalating global tensions and their relative safety vs. overall market volatility. TransDigm stock rose in line with the broader [Aerospace/Defense Industry Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-28-2019/) despite posting preliminary revenue results that are below analyst estimates.


The Cleveland-based company supplies a variety of key aircraft components, including actuators, power controls, ignition systems and gear pumps. In March, it added to its exposure to the OEM and aftermarket sectors by acquiring Esterline Technologies for $4 billion.


Its customers include fellow aerospace and defense stocks **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) and **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)). TransDigm supplies components for Boeing's F-15 fighter and Lockheed's F-35 stealth fighter.


Late Monday, the [Pentagon awarded Lockheed a $7 billion contract for 114 F-35s](https://www.investors.com/news/f35-lockheed-delivery-time-improved-pentagon-awards-contract/), covering part of a $34 billion handshake deal for production lots 12, 13 and 14, which include 478 jets.


And while Boeing's 737 Max remains grounded with deliveries on hold and production ratcheted back, rival **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)) is still scoring huge orders. On Tuesday, [Airbus won a 300-jet order from Indian discount airliner IndiGo](https://www.investors.com/news/airbus-a320-30-billion-indigo-order-grounding-looms/) worth roughly $30 billion, marking one of the largest deals ever for the narrow-body A320.

TransDigm Stock
---------------


Shares closed down 0.3% at 525.97 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), reversing earlier gains after rising as high as 539.68. TransDigm stock has formed a flat base with a potential 542.20 buy point, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). It is a second-stage base. IBD research has found such early stage bases have a higher chance of success.


A bullish sign for the stock is it recently [punched back above its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). Previously, the stock surged after an earnings gap-up in early August, but it has been consolidating since Sept. 5.


The [relative strength line for TransDigm stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is just off record highs. It has pulled back slightly during the recent consolidation.


TransDigm stock has a 91 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Earnings are a big driver for the stock, which is [reflected in its EPS Rating of 94](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/). The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-transdigm-group-inc-tdg.htm) tool shows TransDigm earnings have grown by an average of 21% over the past three quarters. While this is strong, it is just shy of [CAN SLIM requirements](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). They are also quite lumpy, struggling to build a consistent period of acceleration.


UBS analyst Miles Walton backed his buy rating on TransDigm stock in August, also giving it a price target of 605, due in part to the Esterline deal.


"For the first full quarter of Esterline ownership, the business performed very well as sales rose 9% yoy with EBITDA margins hitting 24.6% (not fully comparable to historical levels but worth noting the roughly 1000 basis points of improvement)," he said in a research note.



Cloud Hangs Over TransDigm Stock
--------------------------------


While the firm has yet to finalized its financial results, it did release some preliminary figures Tuesday. It projected sales of $1.525 billion-$1.545 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, below the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.66 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.


The firm also announced a proposed offering of senior subordinated notes, with the proceeds to be used to redeem all of its outstanding notes due in 2022. Remaining proceeds will be used for general purposes, which could include potential future acquisitions.


TransDigm also was recently accused of price gouging by the Pentagon. A Defense Department inspector general's report released in February found it was earning "excess profits" from the department. The report looked at 47 parts and found that TransDigm's profit margins were 1,000% or more for 17 of them.


Last year, the Defense Logistics Agency paid $4,361 for a [drive pin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/pentagon-contractor-s-9-400-profit-on-half-inch-pin-challenged) that should cost $46, Bloomberg reported. The House Oversight and Reform Committee asked for a refund of the $16.1 million that TransDigm overcharged in defense contracts. The company initially pushed back on the decision before agreeing to repay.

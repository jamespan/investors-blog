**On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)), the running-shoe maker backed by tennis star Roger Federer, was Monday's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). ONON stock shot up Tuesday morning after the company's first earnings report since coming public, indicating a buy signal on possible earnings.




On Monday, ONON stock was touted as a an [earnings options play](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) ahead of its third-quarter results.


The setup for the stock arrives two months after On Holding's IPO, and after more people embraced outdoor activities last year due to indoor restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. But On and other shoemakers could face pressure on their supply chains, following manufacturing shutdowns in Vietnam that only recently ended.


On Holding Earnings
-------------------


On Holding earnings per share came in at 0.04 Swiss franc (4 cents). Revenue jumped 68% to 218.04 million Swiss francs ($235.20 million). Those appeared to be above analyst estimates. The company also guided higher for 2021 and 2022 revenue.


On Holding, citing "recent events in Vietnam," said it expects a "transitory" impact on business in Q4 and the first half of 2022. But the company guided higher for full-year 2021 and 2022 revenue.


ONON Stock
----------


ONON stock jumped nearly 10% to 39.95 before the open in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). After the open ONON stock rocketed 24% higher from Monday's close, to 45.30. On Holding stock blasted past the 39.90 buy point of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The cup-with-handle pattern is ONON stock's first ever, making it an IPO base.


Monday's ONON Stock Options Trade
---------------------------------


Buying a stock ahead of its earnings report can be risky. But IBD's options strategy can help soften the threat to investors if a stock takes a big hit after an earnings report. Using an option provides a defined risk — what you paid for the option — while still benefiting from any potential upside.


As of late-morning trade on Monday, the Dec. 17 expiration call for ONON stock with a $40 strike showed a midpoint of around $2.03 per contract.


That means if you buy one call option at $2.03, you have the right to buy 100 shares of ONON stock at 40 by as late as Dec. 17.


The risk of this trade, by IBD's measurement, is about 5.4% — or 2.03 divided by the then-stock price of 37.73, multiplied by 100.


As of Monday afternoon, [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/?src=APA1BQ) switched from a quarter-position in ONON stock to an earnings option equivalent of a half position.


ONON stock has a 76 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 67.


On Holding Earnings Estimates
-----------------------------


Wall Street expects On Holding to lose 12 cents per share during the third quarter, according to FactSet. Sales were seen coming in at $198.3 million. ONON stock debuted on Sept. 15.


On's running shoes, it says, are designed around the concept of "soft landings followed by explosive takeoffs." Over the years, the company has expanded its appeal beyond athletes to outdoor and travel enthusiasts, it said in its IPO prospectus. On sells running and hiking shoes, along with vests, hoodies and other apparel.


Still, 97% of On's footwear last year was made in Vietnam. Vietnam is reopening after the coronavirus pandemic shut down factories earlier this year. But other footwear makers, like **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), [have felt the impact from those closures.](https://www.investors.com/news/crocs-stock-slips-ahead-of-earnings-after-big-buyback-growth-plans/)

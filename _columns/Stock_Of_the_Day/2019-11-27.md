Contract manufacturer **Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it earns plaudits for diversifying its business and improving profitability. Jabil stock is trading near a 13-year high following a recent breakout.




The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company saw its shares gap up after it delivered better-than-expected [fiscal fourth-quarter earnings](https://investors.jabil.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jabil-momentum-continues-another-strong-year) on Sept. 24. Jabil stock hit a recent high of 39.73 on Nov. 12. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Jabil rose 0.3% to 39.34.


On Sept. 11, Jabil stock touched a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 32.34 out of a 10-week [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. But [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/) was only 4% higher than usual that day. Over the next week or so, Jabil stock pulled back, almost triggering a [sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


After it posted upbeat quarterly results, Jabil stock surged back into the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) of the earlier [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). It then marched progressively higher until it reached the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/), where it still is now.

Double-Digit Sales Growth For 7 Straight Quarters
-------------------------------------------------


Jabil stock now has formed a bullish [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/). The buy point is 39.83.


Jabil earned an adjusted 88 cents a share on sales of $6.57 billion in its quarter ended Aug. 31. On a year-over-year basis, Jabil earnings rose 26% while sales climbed 14%. It was the company's second quarter in a row of accelerating earnings growth. Jabil has now posted seven straight quarters of double-digit gains in sales year over year.


Analysts expected Jabil earnings of 86 cents a share on sales of $6.61 billion, Zacks said.


Jabil Sales Gains From 5G, Cloud, Other Markets
-----------------------------------------------


"Our revenue was driven higher by targeted end-markets in the areas of 5G, cloud, energy and health care," Chief Executive Mark Mondello said in a news release. "Looking ahead, we expect the positive momentum to continue as we remain committed to driving margin expansion and delivering strong cash flows, derived from a well-balanced stream of revenue."


For its fiscal first quarter, Jabil guided to adjusted earnings per share of 93 cents on sales of $7 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its outlook. Those figures would translate to growth of 3% in earnings and 8% in sales.


Jabil provides design, manufacturing, supply chain and other services for a host of industries, including electronics, health care and automotive.


Reducing Its Exposure To Major Customer Apple
---------------------------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is a major customer, for which Jabil makes casings for the iPhone and other products. But Jabil has diversified away from its reliance on Apple in the past year. For instance, in late 2018, Jabil entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)).


In its fiscal 2019, Apple accounted for 22% of Jabil's revenue. That's down from 28% in 2018 and 24% in 2017 and 2016, according to RBC Capital Markets.


At the same time, Jabil has been diversifying its business within Apple.


"Historically, casings were almost all of its business with Apple; today, it makes up less than one-third of Jabil's business with Apple," RBC analyst Robert Muller said in a Nov. 12 report.


Jabil makes a component or part for almost every Apple product today, Muller said.


"This diversification within Apple allows Jabil to better weather changes in consumer demand for various products," Muller said.


Profit Margin Expansion Seen
----------------------------



Jabil is now focused on improving its profitability, he said.


"Following high revenue growth in 2018 and 2019, maturing contracts should drive operating margin expansion," Muller said. The "diversification strategy, both overall and within Apple, is working, which should reduce earnings volatility."


Jabil stock has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-jabil-inc-jbl.aspx). That means it is in the top 1% of stocks in key fundamental and technical metrics.


It ranks first out of 15 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Contract Manufacturing industry group. That group currently is No. 2 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

**O'Reilly Auto Parts** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). O'Reilly stock, up 81% from its April 2018 low, tested a new buy point in Tuesday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). The auto parts retail group has been a stock market leader for quite a while, with **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) and **Monro** ([MNRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNRO)) at or near record highs.




O'Reilly Auto Parts serves the individual or do-it-yourself (DIY) and commercial or do-it-for-me (DIFM) customer.


O'Reilly's dual-market approach is seen as the best developed among national auto parts retailers. Rivals include AutoZone, **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) and Genuine Parts. Other group members include Monro and **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), which sells salvaged vehicles and is the current top-rated in this group.


O'Reilly Auto Parts and its peers benefit from the rising number of miles driven in the U.S. and increasing age of vehicles on the road. In a slowing economy, consumers are more likely to hang onto their existing cars and fix up old cars rather than buy new cars.

[U.S. new auto sales slumped in Q1](https://www.investors.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4405087&action=edit), new data showed Tuesday, while [used car sales are hitting their highest level](https://www.edmunds.com/industry/press/used-vehicle-market-poised-for-record-sales-in-2019-according-to-new-report-from-edmunds.html) since the recession.


An [IBD Stock Of The Day column](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/oreilly-auto-parts-oreilly-stock-buy-point/) Jan. 3 flagged O'Reilly stock as one that tends to do well when the stock market wilts. But that doesn't always translate to big gains when the stock market roars ahead.


O'Reilly Auto Parts Stock: Technical Analysis
---------------------------------------------


Shares of O'Reilly rose 0.7% to 394.33 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). O'Reilly stock briefly topped a 394.52 [base-on-base entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) as it pegged an all-time high intraday. Trading volume was well below average Tuesday. Investors should look for breakouts coming on volume that's 40%-50% above normal.


O'Reilly stock built the [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) entirely above the 50-day moving average, a bullish sign.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), tracking a stock's performance against the S&P 500, has been moving sideways for several months. O'Reilly stock didn't really fall during the severe correction late last year. Shares continued to move sideways during the current stock market rally until breaking out following earnings in early February.


O'Reilly Auto Parts stock has nearly doubled in the past year amid a series of breakouts, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). That could narrow the potential for future gains.


O'Reilly Stock Has Great Fundamentals
-------------------------------------


O'Reilly stock earns a superior [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 97. Earnings were a key driver, with the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-woodward-inc-wwd.aspx) showing that it averaged EPS growth of 19% over the past three years. O'Reilly earnings growth rose by an average 36% over the last three quarters.


That backs an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 96, but analysts see O'Reilly earnings growth slowing to 10% this year and 11% in 2020.


Sales growth in the past looks more humdrum. It averaged 6% over the past three years, as well as in the last two quarters.


On the technical side, strong institutional demand for shares and solid average volume back O'Reilly stock, which earns an [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Relative+Price+Strength+(RS)+Rating+or+Relative+Strength&termid=1) of 93.


The [Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-o-reilly-automotive-inc-orly.htm) is rated No. 9 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD.


AutoZone stock rose 1.2%, right at record highs. Genuine Parts stock dipped 0.5%, holding just above a buy point cleared Monday. Monro stock slid 2.2%, dropping back into the 5% chase zone. Copart stock climbed 1.6%, now slightly extended from the buy zone. Advanced Auto Parts stock lost 0.2%, working on a buy point from a consolidation going back to mid-November.


O'Reilly Earnings Await
-----------------------


O'Reilly earnings missed views in early February but shares still rose as the company said same-store sales growth could pick up this year.


On April 24, O'Reilly earnings for the first quarter are due. Analysts expect O'Reilly earnings per share to rise 12%.


Its earnings will kick off reports from competitors in the auto parts retail sector.

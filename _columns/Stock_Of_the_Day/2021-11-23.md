**Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) is the **[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/),** as crude oil prices rose Tuesday despite President Joe Biden's decision to release strategic reserves. PXD stock is flashing an early entry as it closes in on a buy point.




Oil prices are reversing higher, after recently hitting seven-week lows. U.S. crude oil prices rose 2.3% to $78.50 a barrel.


Biden announced the release of 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The release is not a huge amount, and the decision had been in the works for a while, so the market had likely already priced in the move.


Other major energy-consuming nations, including China, India, Japan, Korea and the U.K. are also releasing reserves, in an effort to pressure OPEC+ to hike production.


"American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic," the White House said in a [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/23/president-biden-announces-release-from-the-strategic-petroleum-reserve-as-part-of-ongoing-efforts-to-lower-prices-and-address-lack-of-supply-around-the-world/).

**Pioneer Earnings**
--------------------


The oil and gas exploration company's sales and earnings have exploded in the last three quarters, as demand for oil has spiked amid a post-pandemic economic reboot. 


In the third quarter, Pioneer earnings per share shot up to $4.13 vs. 17 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Sales surged 146% to $4.46 billion.


FactSet analysts see Pioneer earnings of $4.70 a share for its fourth quarter, vs. $1.07 for the same period last year. They expect sales to pop another 176% to $5.12 billion.


CEO Scott Douglas Sheffield said in a call with investors on Nov. 4 that he sees a tight oil market over the next several years that would support prices of up to $100 a barrel.


"Unused capacity in OPEC+ is going to be used up in the next two years. There's no extra supply," he said. "I'm a firm believer that we're going to be in an $80 to $100 scenario over the next several years, if not higher."


Earlier this month, Pioneer agreed to sell its Delaware Basin assets to **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) for $3.2 billion.

However, the market is seeing a lot of sector rotation again. That's boosting oil stocks right now, but if crude prices fall again, those stocks will likely come under pressure again.

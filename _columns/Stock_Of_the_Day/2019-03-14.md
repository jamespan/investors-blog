Textbook and online education provider **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), after triggering a key profit-taking rule thanks to a powerful post-breakout surge.




The California-based company broke out from an 18-week consolidation on Jan. 10. A strong earnings report a month later propelled Chegg to new heights on the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/what-is-the-stock-market-how-does-the-stock-market-work/).


Shares finished 1.3% higher at a fresh record closing high of 41.23 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), 25% above its 32.92 buy point, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Chegg stock is also showing strength, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) at a new high. This means the stock continues to outperform the broad market, which itself is strong since the beginning of the year.


After a run-up of 20%-25%, [it's a good time to take at least partial profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) because many stocks consolidate after gains of that magnitude.


IBD founder William J. O'Neil says one of the secrets to investing is to hop off the elevator on the way up, rather than riding it back down again. Selling a stock can give you a margin of safety, and you can always buy again if it goes on to form another base.

How To Play Chegg Stock
-----------------------


But the [profit-taking sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/) can be also have different triggers depending on how you are timing your trades.


If your timeline is shorter, you could take half profits at 20% and let the rest ride until it closes below the 10-day moving average. If it's a little longer, a close below 20-day avg can function as an exit sign.


For those looking to hold longer term, a close below the 10-week moving average in heavy volume or a [climax run](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/) can be signals for when you should take some money from the table.


Of course, if you did not buy Chegg stock then you can now add it to your watch list in case it goes on to form a new base. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chegg-inc-chgg.aspx) shows it has been performing well, which is why it has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 98. This puts it in the top 2% of all stocks tracked.


Its three-year earnings per share growth rate is 137%. And over the last three quarters, Chegg's earnings growth has averaged 255%. Its stock market performance has been a key reason for the its [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 97.


Chegg Evolves Beyond Textbooks
------------------------------


The education-focused company has moved on from its legacy textbook rental service, pressured by growing competition from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Barnes & Noble Education** ([BNED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNED)).


It now runs this part of its business in partnership with private operator Ingram Content. Ingram provides the books and carries out the distribution, while students set up the rentals on Chegg's website. Ingram gets 100% of the fee and pays Chegg a 20% commission.


Chegg opted not to leave the market because it provides a funnel for sales leads. The real money comes when it sells digital services to the 6 million-7 million students per year who rent textbooks through the site.


The main product is Chegg Study, a $14.99 per month service that offers a vast online library of textbook content for science, math, business and engineering subjects. Other products include Chegg Writing and Chegg Tutors, which provide virtual online academic coaching.

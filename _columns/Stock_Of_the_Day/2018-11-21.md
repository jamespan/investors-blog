**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, as the Dow Jones industrial average component is showing signs of life while other financial stocks get pulled lower by concerns about higher borrowing costs and global chafing over trade.







American Express Stock
----------------------


The credit-card giant is making its way through a flat base with a 111.87 buy point. The stock was also holding into its 50-day line. Investors will often buy a stock if its price hits that level if they believe the company is strong enough to justify it.


American Express stock rose 0.4% at 106.50 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), outpacing the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell less than a point. Fellow Dow Jones financial component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) lost 0.75%


American Express issues its own credit cards directly, the way banks do. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) (another Dow Jones index component) or **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) do not. Instead, those two companies provide the payment-network infrastructure for credit-card transactions.


AmEx has a Composite Rating of 90 out of a best-possible 99. The stock is up some 7% so far this year.


Last month, AmEx's [Q3 earnings beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/american-express-earnings-q3-american-express-stock/), and management raised its full-year profit outlook.


"We delivered strong results this quarter driven by higher Card Member spending, fee income and loans," CEO Stephen J. Squeri said in a statement.


Other Financial Stocks Falter
-----------------------------


The rating for American Express stock compares to a 78 for rival card issuer **Discover Financial Services** ([DFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFS)), which is down around 10% so far this year. **Capital One** ([COF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COF)), down 12% this year, trails them both, with a rating of 58.


Throughout 2018, financial stocks have run up against questions over when tax cuts might turn into loan growth. The flatter yield curve, which indicates greater long-term investor optimism about the economy when it isn't flat, has also worried bank investors. Executives have signaled that the U.S. economy is sturdy enough to withstand any fallout from international tensions.


"The economy is still very strong, and that's across wages, job creation, capital expenditure, consumer credit," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon [said last month](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-earnings-q3-jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo/). "It's pretty broad-based, and it's not going to be diminished immediately."


American Express Marks A First In China
---------------------------------------


Earlier this month, the company said it became the "first foreign payments network allowed to build a network in mainland China."


American Express received preliminary approval from the country's central bank to begin building its network business via a joint venture with LianLian, a fintech services company there.


The green light from China gives AmEx access to a massive economy, but one subject to occasionally unpredictable regulations.


The move also could pit AmEx against UnionPay, the government-backed firm in China that handles card transactions.


The joint venture with LianLian would also enable charges on American Express branded cards to be settled by the joint venture. Mastercard, Visa and American Express are [only permitted to issue co-branded cards](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/09/business/american-express-china/index.html), often in collaboration with UnionPay, according to CNN.


Still, AmEx faces an investigation by the FBI into what is suspected to be misleading pricing practices in its foreign exchange unit. That segment makes up a small portion of American Express' business.

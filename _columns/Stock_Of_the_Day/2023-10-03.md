**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm shows strength after posting better-than-expected earnings in its recent quarterly report. PANW stock is hovering below a buy point.




On Aug. 18, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reported adjusted earnings of $1.44 a share for its [fiscal fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-stock-friday-earnings-announcement/) ended July 31. Earnings per share jumped 80% year over year and topped Wall Street's target of $1.29 per share.


Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks' sales climbed 26% to $1.95 billion in the period. That was just below the Street's consensus estimate of $1.96 billion.


"Our strategy is resonating with a growing number of our customers, driving continued consolidation, to deliver superior security outcomes," Chief Executive Nikesh Arora said in a [news release](https://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/news-releases/news-release-details/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-7).


He added, "We were delighted with the reception in the market for our AI-based security automation platform, XSIAM."


PANW Stock Is In Consolidation
------------------------------


PANW stock surged 15% in its first trading session after the earnings report.


Since then, Palo Alto Networks has seesawed around its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). PANW stock has been [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) for the past 14 weeks around a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 258.88, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), PANW stock slid 2.5% to 230.97.


Aggressive investors could use a bounce off its 50-day line as an early entry point, if PANW stock tops Friday's high of 238.34. But with the [stock market in correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-m-in-can-slim-why-market-direction-is-key-to-winning-in-stocks/), investors should also be cautious.


In a recent note to clients, Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala reiterated his overweight, or buy, rating on PANW stock with a price target of 304. He favors Palo Alto for its exposure to the public-sector security market.


"The public sector has been notably strong this year, followed by health care and pharma," he said.


Also, Palo Alto is benefiting from customer demand for vendor consolidation of cybersecurity tools.


"With the average enterprise deploying over 50 different security tools, the demand for vendor consolidation remains high and PANW is a leading beneficiary given its broad platform," Fodderwala said.

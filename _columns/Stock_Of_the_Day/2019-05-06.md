**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it sets up new buying opportunities after rebounding from a key technical support level.

Chipotle earnings plunged in 2016 due to the food illness scare, giving the company a -15% EPS growth rate over the past five years. That's why the stock has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 61. But the situation is improving. The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg.aspx) shows earnings have grown by an average of 50% over the past three quarters. Revenue growth has accelerated for the past four quarters, to 14%.


Chipotle is still working to regain public trust after a string of food-safety issues, and last month the firm revealed it had [received a new subpoena related to earlier incidents](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q1-2019-chipotle-stock/). Before the latest disclosure, management reported positive results from its "For Real" marketing campaign.


The Newport Beach, Calif.-based chain also has been working to improve stores. The initiatives translated to much-stronger-than-expected Q4 2018 earnings, while last month it also posted strong first-quarter earnings.


Chipotle has been making efforts to freshen up menu offerings, and to increase customer flow through initiatives such as mobile order and pay, and DoorDash delivery.



Analyst Hungry For Chipotle Stock
---------------------------------


Piper Jaffray managing director Nicole Miller Regan told Investor's Business Daily earlier this year that she is [bullish on Chipotle stock](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/restaurant-stocks-starbucks-stock-mcdonalds-stock-chipotle-stock-winners/).


"I would consider 2019 still a year of transition, but their same-store sales tell you they're on the right track," the analyst said. "A new management team and a shift in culture goes a long way."


Miller Regan believes that new [Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-taps-taco-bell-chief-as-new-ceo-in-major-culture-shift/), previously Taco Bell chief executive, has been making the right moves so far to regain trust.


And while Chipotle stock is now trading above 700, there could be even more upside ahead for investors if everything goes right for the stock.


"Our bull case scenario implies shares could reach the $800 per share or higher level as the broader recovery plays out over time," she said.

Twilio Called Integral To Digital Transformation Plans
------------------------------------------------------


Twilio formed its current base in a swoon following its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 26. The company beat Wall Street's estimates for the September quarter, but its [earnings guidance disappointed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twilio-earnings-twlo-stock-news-q32020/).


During its recent swoon, Twilio stock found support at its [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


San Francisco-based Twilio offers a cloud communications platform for voice, text, chat, video and email applications.


Twilio is the leading Communications Platform as a Service provider, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in note to clients after the company's third-quarter earnings report. As such, it is "an integral centerpiece of customer digital transformation plans," he said. Walkley rates Twilio stock as buy with a price target of 385.


Organizations have accelerated their digital transformation efforts because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The health crisis has fueled the work-from-home boom and boosted e-commerce activity.


Twilio Stock Rated Buy On Growth Potential
------------------------------------------


Twilio management has guided to 30% annual organic revenue growth over the next four years.


Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reiterated his outperform rating on Twilio stock on Nov. 16 after meeting with the company's chief financial officer, Khozema Shipchandler. The meeting helped to underscore the company's growth potential, Wood said. Wood has a price target on TWLO stock of 375.


Twilio stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-twilio-inc-cl-a-twlo.aspx) tool. The Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Twilio Ranks No. 14 In Enterprise Software Group
------------------------------------------------


However, Twilio stock ranks No. 14 out of 83 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group. That group ranks No. 72 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.


Twilio stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96. That means it has outperformed 96% of stocks over the past 12 months.


But [TWLO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/twlo-stock-buy-now/) has lost some steam lately, which is reflected in its sideways-moving [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/).

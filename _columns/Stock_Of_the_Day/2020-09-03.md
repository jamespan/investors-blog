**Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) amid a broad sell-off in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite. The provider of cloud-based networking and cybersecurity services sent a sell signal as it tumbled through its 10-week moving average line.




San Francisco-based Cloudflare has been on theÂ IBD Leaderboard, though with only a one-quarter position. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.


Cloudflare earnings and revenue topped June-quarter analyst estimates while revenue guidance came in slightly above Wall Street targets. However, many stocks begin to fail well before the fundamentals suggest trouble.


That's where the 10-week moving average comes in. A stock that [closes below its 10-week line often sends a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).

Not only is Cloudflare stock well below its 10-week line now, it also is below last week's low and the low of the week ended Aug. 14.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Cloudflare fell 7.1% to 36.23.


Cloudflare stock holds a respectable IBD Relative Strength Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. The best stocks own ratings above 80. But, Cloudflare's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been weakening since late July.


Cloudflare Stock: Sell Signal Kicks In
--------------------------------------


At the same time, the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of Cloudflare stock has dropped to C+ from B, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. On an A+ to E scale, the rating measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Investors that recently bought Cloudflare stock and are down 7% to 8% should sell. Investors down a bit less could do the same.


If investors bought shares in Cloudflare stock in June when the stock broke out near 31, they could sell part of their position now and wait for Friday's close. If Cloudflare stock closes decisively below the 10-week line (2% or more) on a weekly chart, that's a very strong sell signal.


The Cloudflare initial public offering, which priced at $18 a share last September, raised $525 million. Venrock Associates, which started out as the venture arm of the Rockefeller family, was among early investors.


Stock Consolidated After Earnings Report
----------------------------------------


Cloudflare offers a wide range of software-as-a-service products that leverage a global cloud network. The network spans nearly 200 cities and interconnects over 8,000 networks globally.


About 10% of the Fortune 1,000 companies are paying customers and 10% of the top million websites use at least one Cloudflare solution, according to a Morgan Stanley report. Cloudflare specializes in security as well as speeding up internet services.


Cloudflare stock plunged in early March as the coronavirus spread globally but rebounded along with other technology stocks, particularly software companies.


Started in 2009, Cloudflare on Aug. 6 reported an adjusted 3-cent loss per share. Revenue jumped 48% to $99.7 million. Analysts expected Cloudflare to report a loss of 6 cents per share on revenue of $94.1 million for the period ended June 30.


The next day, Cloudflare stock jumped to an all-time high of 45.28 in intraday trading. But, it could not hold the gain and closed down 3% on Aug. 7.


Cloudflare stock consolidated as the Nasdaq rose through August. Many technology stocks became [extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). While it's OK for a relative strength line to drift down during a consolidation, in Cloudflare's case it weakened a lot.

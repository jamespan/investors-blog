Apple Stock In Narrow Trading Range
-----------------------------------


Earlier, on June 30, Apple stock hit a buy point of 137.17 out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), according to a daily MarketSmith chart.


Apple stock has been trading in a narrow range since it posted blowout results for its fiscal third quarter ended June 26, thanks to strong iPhone sales. Lately, it has found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


[Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) could offer an additional buy point if it breaks its current short downtrend. Also, if it keeps moving sideways for two more weeks, it would form a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


All Eyes On iPhone 13 Launch
----------------------------


The next potential catalyst for Apple stock likely will be the introduction of the company's [iPhone 13 handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-investor-focus-shifts-to-iphone-13-launch/) in September. The new models will be Apple's second-generation 5G smartphones after the current iPhone 12 series.


On Monday, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 184.


In a note to clients, White said, "Apple has enhanced its value proposition (during the Covid-19 pandemic) by introducing new innovations (and) supporting a more digital lifestyle."


He believes the iPhone 13 launch in September will be the next mover for Apple stock.


Apple Car In The Works?
-----------------------


Meanwhile, [the Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/08/693_313622.html) reported Monday that Apple has been in talks with multiple Korean companies about supplying components for the rumored Apple electric vehicle. Apple has held "early stage talks" with LG Electronics, SK Group and Hanwha Group, the article said.


Apple stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89 out of 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-inc-aapl.aspx). IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


But Apple has a mediocre [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 66 out of 99. The Relative Strength Rating shows how a stock's price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks.


Also, Apple stock has an [IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of C-, indicating lackluster institutional buying of shares.

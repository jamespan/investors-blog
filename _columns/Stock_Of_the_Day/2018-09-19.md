**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) is the IBD Stock of the Day as the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart breaks out into buy range Wednesday amid robust demand in the aviation sector.







The aerospace giant is racing to fill all its orders and could hike output of its best-selling 737 aircraft to a record level of 63 per month.


Local records show Boeing and the city of [Renton, Wash., reportedly signed leases](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2018/09/18/boeing-737-production-63-per-month-renton-factory.html) at the airport near the 737 factory, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal, allowing the plant's three assembly lines to produce 21 jets a month.


That would quicken the pace even further from the current pace of 52 a month as well as aid plans for an increase to 57 a month in 2019.


A further ramp up in production would come despite recent headaches with suppliers **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) and **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)), whose delays have prevented Boeing from delivering finished 737s to customers.


But there are signs that bottleneck is clearing. Boeing [delivered 64 aircraft in August](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-delivery-delays-737-china-demand-raised/), including 48 737s. That was up from 39 aircraft deliveries in July, including 29 737s.


Boeing also saw a big jump in August orders, with China demand seen growing stronger-than-expected over the next 20 years.

Stock Of The Day: Sizing Up Boeing
----------------------------------


Shares rose 0.45% to 365.22 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), surpassing a 364.64 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) buy point in a base-on-base formation. But Boeing stock closed well off its session high of 371.23.


Rival **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)) gained 1.1% as shares continue a test of the 50-day moving average.


After a steep run-up last year, when Boeing was the top-performing Dow Jones industrial average stock, shares have basically moved sideways since February, forming three bases over the last seven months.


Similarly, its relative strength line has changed little, but since July it has hit a consolidation peak, a bullish sign. Now investors may want to watch for the trend line to move into new high ground.


Boeing stock's [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 94 reflects sold technicals and fundamentals. An [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 92 highlights average earnings growth of 65% over the past three quarters.


But earnings deceleration in the June quarter and tepid top-line growth offset the positives.


Aerospace And Defense Stocks
----------------------------


The easing of production and delivery bottlenecks bodes well for Boeing and Airbus. Both struggled to meet demand for planes in the past year, while airline traffic surged.


Now Trump's trade war with China and recovering oil prices are potential headwinds.


Still, airline and defense stocks have made notable recent moves. **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)), **L-3 Technologies** ([LLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLL)) and **Curtiss-Wright** ([CW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CW)) continue to flirt with buy points but were mixed in Wednesday trade.

**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the medical aesthetics player rockets 60% above its initial public offering price just last month.




The medical aesthetics company went public on Aug. 8 with an IPO priced at 14 per share. In morning trading on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), InMode [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) soared 12.9% to close at 25.27, touching a record intraday high of 25.85. InMode stock closed 60% above its IPO price on Tuesday.


The stock on Wednesday cleared a 23.83 entry point in a [narrow IPO base,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) as well as the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) that goes up to 25.02.


On Tuesday, UBS analyst Matthew Taylor initiated coverage of InMode stock with a buy rating and 28 price target. He expects sales to grow at a 20% compound annual rate from 2020 to 2022. Further, InMode "is very profitable" with high gross margins, he said in a report to clients.


"InMode is a burgeoning company in the aesthetics/wellness space backed by proprietary platforms underpinned by key (intellectual property), long development timelines and clinical data that give it a healthy moat," he said.

InMode was founded in 2008. Generally, it can take some time for medical companies to become profitable. But InMode has been profitable for several years. In the second quarter, InMode posted adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share. That grew 109% year over year.


On an as-reported basis, InMode earnings more than doubled year over year to 45 cents per share in that quarter.


Medical Aesthetics Player Goes Public
-------------------------------------


The medical aesthetics company makes devices that use radio-frequency technology. Its products run the gamut from plastic surgery, gynecology and dermatology to otolaryngology (ears, nose and throat) and ophthalmology.


Last month, pop star [Paula Abdul signed on](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-aesthetics-ipo-inmode-stock-rises-paula-abdul-endorsement/) to be a brand ambassador just as the medical aesthetics player reported $38.8 million in second-quarter sales, up 55% year over year. The company said the results were in line with expectations.


So far, physicians and customers appear impressed with InMode's offerings, UBS' Taylor said.


"Feedback has been excellent with doctors calling their products 'state of the art' and best in class," he said. "The company also has good brand recognition, a reputation for quality and we found no evidence of safety issues."



Targeting Women's Health, Aesthetics
------------------------------------


The market for medical aesthetics is massive. It will be worth almost $19 billion by 2024, according to research firm Markets and Markets. Financial Buzz put the market at $22.2 billion by 2025.


InMode's products allow patients to avoid surgery, Taylor said. Further, he sees room for growth in women's health, otolaryngology and ophthalmology, "backed by a robust research and development engine."


Taylor says InMode stock deserves a premium compared with other aesthetic players. The market is led by **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)), the maker of Botox, breast implants and fillers for wrinkles. **[AbbVie](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abbvie-stock-buy-now/)** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) [is acquiring Allergan](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abbvie-stock-new-cash-king-buys-botox-maker-allergan-diversify-humira/) for $63 billion.


InMode Stock Has High Ratings
-----------------------------


InMode stock is highly rated, according to Investor's Business Daily's standards.


Shares have a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) and [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 99.

Semiconductor equipment vendor **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it nears a buy point ahead of its fiscal first-quarter earnings report. Aehr stock has formed a cup-with-handle base.




The Fremont, Calif.-based company hasn't set a date yet for its fiscal Q1 earnings release, but it is likely to be in early October.


Aehr stock rocketed 18.2% on July 14 in response to the company's [fiscal fourth-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/aehr-stock-chip-gear-maker-beats-q4-targets/). It notched a record high of 54.10 on Aug. 1 before pulling back in the recent consolidation.


The company forecast accelerating sales and earnings growth thanks to strong demand for test gear for silicon carbide, or SiC, semiconductors used in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure.


Aehr also is seeing growth in equipment for testing silicon photonics devices used in data and telecommunications infrastructure.


Electric Vehicles Fueling Growth
--------------------------------


Aehr makes semiconductor test and reliability qualification equipment. Its recent growth has come from systems for test and burn-in of SiC power chips, mostly for electric vehicles. Burn-in is a stress test of a component to detect problems.


"Aehr Test provides complete production solutions for improving quality, reliability, and yield of semiconductors such as silicon carbide devices used in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, silicon photonics devices used in data centers and 5G infrastructure, and also for new applications such as optical input/output (I/O) and co-packaged optics devices that are on the horizon," Chief Executive Gayn Erickson said in a recent [news release](https://www.aehr.com/2023/08/aehr-test-systems-to-participate-in-the-jefferies-semiconductor-it-hardware-communications-technology-summit-on-august-29-2023/).

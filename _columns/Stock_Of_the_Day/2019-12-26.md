**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) is the [IBD Stock Of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the provider of e-commerce services on Thursday hit a new high and touched a [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).




Canada-based Shopify provides a cloud-based, software-as-a-service e-commerce platform that businesses use to build websites and sell goods online and across multiple sales channels. This includes mobile and social media, and brick and mortar storefronts.


It also offers customer relationship management software so businesses can do targeted marketing for their clients. The company helps more than 1 million merchants worldwide to sell, market and manage their products across digital channels. In return, it earns subscription fees. It also offers add-ons such as digital payments and shipping.


Shopify held its initial public offering in May 2015 that raised $131 million, with shares pricing at $17 each. The company turned profitable soon after its stock market debut.

CLOSE




Shopify stock climbed 2.3% to close at 408.75 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The stock broke out of a 16-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) and moved past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 409.71 before falling just short of it at the session's end. The buy zone extends to 430.20.


Shopify Stock Performance In 2019
---------------------------------


Shopify stock has doubled thus far this year. Shares kept trending higher during stock market pullbacks in May and August, an especially bullish sign given the massive run-up in price since 2017.


The large-cap stock previously cleared a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 349.54 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Dec. 3. The stock popped 6% the following day after reporting [Black Friday sales jumped](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-pops-company-reports-holiday-ecommerce-jump/) more than 60% vs. a year ago.


One note of caution is that Shopify's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) lags below a high point reached when the stock hit a high of 409.61 on Aug. 27. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. A rising line points to outperformance.


Further, Shopify reported [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-earnings-shopify-stock-q32019/) on Oct. 29 that missed earnings estimates as the company swung to a loss amid high investments. The news sent shares down, though bulls focused on international growth. Shopify reported a loss of 29 cents a share, vs. a 5-cent profit in the year-ago period. Revenue jumped 45% to $390.6 million.


Shopify is building a U.S. distribution network to store and ship products for its merchant customers. It plans to spend $1 billion over five years and, in the process, hopes to take on e-commerce behemoth **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Recently Shopify raised $600 million in a secondary offering.


For the December quarter, Shopify forecast revenue of $477 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. analysts' consensus estimate of $470.6 million.

The group ranks a decent No. 51 among [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-27-2018/) in recent performance.

ServiceNow stock has consolidated amid a broad sell-off in technology companies. ServiceNow stock is down nearly 10% from September. But the IBD Computer-Software Enterprise group has dropped 17% over the same period.


ServiceNow has a Relative Strength Rating of 88. That means its stock has outperformed nearly nine out of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 index. With its recent gains, it's clawing back closer to a technical buy point of 206.29.


ServiceNow: How Much Growth Left In ITSM?
-----------------------------------------


ServiceNow makes information-technology service management software, or ITSM. Its self-service tech portal enables company employees to access administrative and workflow tools.


Founded in 2004, the software maker prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software,**CA Technologies** ([CA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CA)) and others.


With about $1.92 billion in sales last year, the company has set a goal of hitting $4 billion in revenue in 2020.


One unknown is how much growth is left in the software maker's core ITSM market.


"Whether ITSM is in the bottom of the third or in the seventh-inning stretch, we admire ServiceNow's unwavering platform-of-platforms vision," BTIG Research analyst Joel Fishbein said in a recent report to clients.


ServiceNow Cloud Platform Key
-----------------------------


"The company is replacing older on-premise systems in the same way other companies like Salesforce, NetSuite (part of **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL))) and Workday have re-platformed existing applications with on-demand cloud offerings," he added.


Samad Samana, a Jefferies analyst, recently met with company management.


"According to the company, it has only penetrated about 50% of the ITSM opportunity within its installed base of over 5,000 enterprise customers," Samana said in his note to clients. "We see plenty of room to drive new annual contract growth with ITSM."


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) could be a new rival. Atlassian acquired OpsGenie for $295 million in September. OpsGenie offers an incident management platform for tech departments.


The software maker has expanded from its core ITSM business into tools for human resources, customer service management and security.


In early 2017 ServiceNow named John Donahoe, former chief executive of **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), as its CEO. Donahoe was president and CEO of eBay from 2008 to 2015.


ServiceNow A Takeover Target?
-----------------------------


ServiceNow continues to make small acquisitions to build out a broader software platform. But some analysts also view it as a takeover target.


Baird analyst Colin Sebastian recently speculated that Alphabet-unit **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) could target ServiceNow. He says ServiceNow would help Google's cloud-computing business gain traction in the corporate market.


At Piper Jaffray, analyst Alex Zukin wrote: "We continue to believe that ServiceNow is a unique asset that a number of strategic vendors (Google, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) or Oracle) could be interested in acquiring."

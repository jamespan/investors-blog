**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The yogawear leader finally has a new CEO, and its several consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth point to strength despite heavy competition. Now investors are looking for Lululemon stock, a member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), to find support off a key technical level and potentially form a new buy point.




Yogawear Is Still In
--------------------


The athleisure wear category remains hot and very much on trend, with gym-style clothes still prominently in fashion. The **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) [entry into private label clothes](https://www.investors.com/news/target-amazon-private-label-exclusive-brands/) has not helped to ease any rivalries.


Still, despite the competition, Lululemon has shown staying power, with total comparable sales up 20% in its most recent quarter, including retail comps of 8% and direct-to-consumer revenue growth of 62%.


The company operated 411 stores as of the close of its fiscal first quarter, ended in April.

New Lululemon CEO From Sephora
------------------------------


[Lululemon this week named Calvin McDonald](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-ceo-calvin-mcdonald-named-sephora-veteran/) as its new chief executive. Most recently, he served as president and CEO of the Americas segment of Sephora, the popular prestige beauty retailer that has helped drive growth at parent company LVMH.


Cowen analyst John Kernan called 46-year-old McDonald a "solid hire for the company," noting his Glassdoor ranking as Top CEO in Beauty last year and his "five years of success at the helm of Americas for Sephora — a leader in product innovation, digital and store experience."


Lululemon Stock
---------------


Shares fell 3.6% to 120 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), dropping below the 50-day moving average for the first time in four months. If Lululemon stock can rebound strong in high volume from that key support level, it would offer a new buying opportunity.


The stock has been consolidating for several weeks but hasn't formed a proper base. But if Lululemon stock breaks beyond its 130.49 peak, it would be a buy at 130.59.


Now Lululemon shares are up more than 50% in 2018.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, recently hit highs not seen since 2013. The RS line has pulled back in the last few weeks.


Lululemon Earnings
------------------


Lululemon earnings growth has accelerated for the last three quarters. Revenue growth has sped up for the last four quarters, and Lululemon stock has gapped up after the last four sets of quarterly results.


Retail Stocks A Mixed Bag This Week
-----------------------------------


Elsewhere in the athletic apparel space, shares of sportswear retailer **Columbia Sportswear** ([COLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COLM)) plunged 7.7% Friday on poorly received quarterly results. The North Face parent **VF** ([VFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VFC)) dipped 1% for the week after the prior week's near-10% gain. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) stock fell 1.6% Friday but is near highs after a 10-week line rebound earlier this week. **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)) edged up 0.3% but shares are still below their 50-day and 200-day lines.


But retailers have been no stranger to IBD Stock Of The Day, with **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)), T.J. Maxx parent **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and teen-focused value retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) making appearances on the hot list.


Burlington Stores and Dollar General tested their 50-day lines Friday. Urban Outfitters stock tumbled 4.8% as it fell decisively through that key level. TJX and Five Below sank Friday but are still modestly above their 50-day averages.

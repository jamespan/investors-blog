**PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), on Wednesday joined digital payments rival **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) in allowing customers to buy, sell and hold Bitcoins. PayPal stock climbed on the launch of its cryptocurrency service, moving into a buy zone, while Square stock fell.




San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal said customers will be able to use its online digital payment system to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and other virtual coins. In addition, its customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the [26 million merchants on its network](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2020/PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency/default.aspx) starting in early 2021, the company said. PayPal has 346 million active accounts worldwide.


PayPal has dabbled in cryptocurrency. But in October 2019, PayPal withdrew from **Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) Libra cryptocurrency project.


PayPal stock jumped 5.5% to close at 213.07 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Its stock has a [cup-and-handle entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) of 209.12. With Wednesday's gain, PayPal stock moved into a 5% buy zone. [Bitcoin also surged, hitting highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-brink-fresh-2020-high-133849430.html) not reached in more than a year.

PayPal belongs to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). It's a curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.


PayPal Stock: How Profitable Will Bitcoin Service Be?
-----------------------------------------------------


Both PayPal and Square are building two-sided digital payments ecosystems, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash app, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's Venmo, Zelle and others.


The Square Cash App had 30 million active users as of June 30.


In 2018, Square enabled Cash App users to buy and sell Bitcoins. During the June quarter, Bitcoin sales of $875 million generated $17 million in profit for Square.


In a note to clients, Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri described the new PayPal cryptocurrency service as "another monetization tool, similar to Square, a pass-through revenue item, with no/little margin contribution."


Further, Square in early October said it had purchased about $50 million in Bitcoin. Square stock fell 2.6% to near 181 on Wednesday. Square stock is [extended after a big rally](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/).


PayPal Earnings Due Soon
------------------------


PayPal reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 2. It's expected to release preliminary 2021 guidance.


PayPal reported June-quarter earnings, revenue and total payment volume from merchants that topped estimates as e-commerce boomed amid Covid-19. Total payment volume rose 29% to $222 billion amid the coronavirus lockdown. Analysts had projected total payment volume of $210.73 billion.


Heading into third-quarter earnings, PayPal stock holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93 out of a possible 99.


In addition, PayPal stock has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Former Parent EBay Phasing Out PayPal
-------------------------------------


San Jose, Calif.-based **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) spun off PayPal in 2015. The former parent is phasing out the use of PayPal for its online marketplace. PayPal garners about 9% of total payment volume from eBay.


PayPal's digital payment checkout button is widely accepted among online retailers. More than 80% of the top 30 internet retailers accept PayPal's digital payment system, Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said in a recent report to clients. He called PayPal "the preferred digital wallet option for non-**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) merchants."


On the other hand, PayPal and Square have been battling in the small business market, MoffetNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis said in a recent note. Their rivalry has heated up as small businesses cope with the coronavirus pandemic.


"Over the past two decades, PayPal and Square have built their businesses on the innovative 'master merchant' model, aggregating the risk of millions of micro- and small businesses to extend the reach of digital payments to an underserved segment of the market," Ellis said. Both PayPal and Square provide short-term loans to small businesses.


PayPal Stock: 'Contactless' QR Codes
------------------------------------


While a big player in e-commerce, PayPal aims to build a bigger business in in-person retail sales. The coronavirus emergency presented a new opportunity.


In May, PayPal rolled out its [QR-code digital payments system](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-payments-gain-ground-covid-wary-shoppers-seek-safety/) for micro-merchants, small businesses and large retailers.


Merchants display a QR code on a device, like a terminal, or print it out and have it on display on a tabletop, like at a farmers market. These usually are black-and-white square images often found on packaging. Consumers download a PayPal app and use a smartphone camera to scan the QR code and make a payment.


In July, PayPal announced a partnership with CVS to make the contactless, QR-code payments available in all of its 8,000 U.S. stores.


Meanwhile, **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) on Wednesday introduced its QuickAccept service for merchants. QuickAccept's smartphone credit card reader competes with products from Square and PayPal. JPMorgan aims to set itself apart with a same-day deposit feature for merchants.

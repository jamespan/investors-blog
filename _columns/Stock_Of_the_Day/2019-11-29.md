**Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)), a company that manages fertility benefits for big companies like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Google, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The company went public in October, and Progyny stock has now formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/).




Progyny Stock
-------------


The Progyny IPO priced at $13 per share, below its expectations for $14 to $16 per share. But the stock climbed sharply following its Oct. 25 debut. On Nov. 19, shares touched a high of 29.29. That high marked the beginning of the IPO base. Add 10 cents, and you get a buy point of 29.39.


Progyny stock has an 87 Composite Rating. Its EPS Rating is 76. The company's market value stands at around $2.2 billion, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


While it's tempting to buy an IPO when it first goes public, it's a good idea to see the stock shake out and consolidate. While in hindsight, Progyny stock has soared since its IPO, plenty of new issues quickly fizzle. Longtime leader **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) sold off sharply from its IPO debut, not regaining those first-day highs for more than a year.


An IPO base can be as short as 10 days or even less, though they can sometimes be months long.

Progyny Earnings
----------------


Investors will get a deeper look at financials and industry trends when Progyny reports its first quarterly results as a public company on Wednesday. Analysts expect Progyny earnings of two cents per share on revenue of $60.8 million, according to Yahoo Finance.


Progyny already is profitable to go along with triple-digit revenue growth. Meanwhile, many of the this year's splashiest IPOs, like **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) and **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), are big money losers.


Other IPOs, or IPO attempts, have run up against Wall Street skepticism. Plant-based hamburger maker **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)), which debuted in May, shot higher than flamed out. Workplace-sharing startup WeWork pulled its IPO, after questions about financial disclosures and other company practices.


Progyny stock fell 1.3% to 26.64 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today).


Revenue Doubles
---------------


For the first six months of this year, Progyny's revenue came in at around $103.4 million, more than double a year earlier. Net income from continuing operations for the first half of 2019 was $4 million, compared to losses over the prior three years.


Progyny tries to help employees access fertility treatments and related medications. The company offers benefits packages called the Smart Cycles, which include medical services for a full course of fertility treatment, including diagnostic testing and access to new technology, according to a company IPO prospectus.


Members also get access to patient care advocates, who offer support and guidance related to the treatment process. Progyny also has a pharmacy benefits service, called Progyny Rx, that provides access to medications for fertility treatment.


'Poor Insurance Coverage'
-------------------------


In the Progyny IPO filing, the company says it envisions "a world where anyone who wants to have a child can do so," adding that the prevalence of infertility affects one in eight couples in the U.S.


"Despite its high prevalence and its recognition by the World Health Organization, or WHO, as a disease since 2009, access to treatment has previously been limited by poor insurance coverage in the United States," the company said in the filing.


However, in 2017 and 2018, Progyny's three biggest customers accounted for more than 10% of its total revenue, meaning revenue could suffer if one of them bailed. Google made up 24% of the company's revenue last year. Microsoft accounted for 14% of Progyny's revenue last year. Those figures were smaller in the first half of this year.


Progyny is also going up against a wide array of rivals — including insurance giants like **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)). It also competes against newer benefit managers like Carrot Fertility and Maven Clinic, the prospectus said.


"While we do not believe any single competitor offers a similarly robust and integrated fertility and family building benefits solution, we compete primarily with health insurance companies and benefits administrators that also provide fertility benefits management services as part of their overall health care coverage," Progyny said in the filing.

GoDaddy is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares in the website-hosting firm break out in high volume following an acquisition that boosts its e-commerce capabilities. GoDaddy stock moved into a buy zone with Thursday's rally.




The website-hosting firm formed a [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) from October through March. GoDaddy stock popped in late February when revenue topped estimates. It then traded in a tight zone.


The company has shifted focus from longer-term contracts tied to its internet domain-name registration business to shorter-term contracts related to web hosting, Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Olson said in a recent note to clients. The shift gives GoDaddy more opportunities to upsell customers to new services, he said.


In early 2019, GoDaddy launched GoCentral Online Store, an e-commerce platform that processed customer payments on behalf of merchants. GoDaddy on Wednesday said it acquired Sellbrite to boost its e-commerce strategy. Terms were not disclosed.

With Sellbrite in the fold, GoDaddy added a new feature to its e-commerce platform.


The [Marketplaces feature](https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/news-releases-details/2019/Entrepreneurs-Can-Now-Easily-Sell-Everywhere-with-the-Launch-of-GoDaddy-Marketplaces/default.aspx) will enable GoDaddy's small-business customers to list their products across **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Walmart.com** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and Jet.


GoDaddy Creates Online Marketplace
----------------------------------


"We believe that the launch of Marketplaces bolsters GoDaddy's e-commerce offering and opens up a new upsell opportunity to both new and existing customers," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Naved Khan said in a note to clients.


Website design firm **Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX)), a rival of GoDaddy, also has expanded its product offerings. Wix in mid-December rolled out its new Ascend-branded marketing tools aimed at small businesses.


GoDaddy stock surged 4.7% to close at 79.55 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Shares pushed above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 77.50.


GoDaddy reports first-quarter earnings on May 2. Analysts estimate that profit will pop 450% to 11 cents a share. But GoDaddy is among stocks valued on growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, rather than earnings per share.


Key GoDaddy Financial Metrics
-----------------------------


In addition, analysts use unlevered free cash flow. That's a company's cash flow before taking interest payments into account.


Investors focus on EBITDA or unlevered free cash flow because GoDaddy runs a subscription business and has a heavy amortization load due to numerous acquisitions.


"With an installed base of over 18 million subscribers and an ability to leverage strong brand recognition to add over 1 million subscribers annually, GoDaddy has been able to drive consistent double-digit growth with margin expansion translating into strong (unlevered free cash flow) growth," Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Essex said in a recent report.


Furthermore, he said GoDaddy is targeting annual unlevered free cash flow growth in the 18%-20% range.

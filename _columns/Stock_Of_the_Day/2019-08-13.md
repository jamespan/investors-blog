Amgen stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the biggest biotech company prevailed in a patent battle against **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)), protecting nearly $5 billion in 2019 sales in the U.S.




The [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) flirted with a breakout Tuesday. In early trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Amgen [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) briefly topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 210.29 out of a large consolidation. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) ended the day up 0.2% to 206.12. After three days of sharp gains, a normal pullback is possible.


Shares have been on a three-day run following a judge's decision Friday to [validate two patents](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-buy-point-judge-upholds-enbrel-patents/).


One patent protects the protein underlying blockbuster drug Enbrel. The other protects a method of developing it. The New Jersey judge's decision confirms Enbrel's patented life until 2028-29. In 2019, analysts estimate the arthritis and psoriasis drug could generate $4.6 billion in U.S. sales.

"Don't bet against Amgen lawyers," according to Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat. That's what his mentor told him earlier this year. As it turns out, "he was absolutely right."


Biotech Company's Biggest Drug Protected
----------------------------------------


Enbrel is Amgen's biggest moneymaker. In 2018, Enbrel generated $5.01 billion in global sales. Nearly all of that, 96%, came from the U.S. This year, analysts expect Enbrel to bring in roughly $4.6 billion in U.S. sales alone, Credit Suisse analyst Evan Seigerman said in a recent report.


That's part of the reason Novartis subsidiary Sandoz is trying to sell a copycat. Sandoz developed an [Enbrel biosimilar](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biosimilars-rival-biologics-amgen-abbvie-roche/) — a nearly identical copy of a [biologic drug](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceuticals-and-biologics-differences/) — and gained Food and Drug Administration [approval in 2016](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-sandoz-enbrel-biosimilar-delayed/).


But, in the wake of that approval, Sandoz's biosimilar has been wrapped up in a patent battle.


Prior to the judge's decision, Sandoz had said it would launch that drug, dubbed Erelzi, in 2020. Now, that seems "both unlikely and ill-advised," SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report. Doing so could land Sandoz in hot water with financial liabilities.


Porges kept his market perform rating on Amgen stock. Credit Suisse's Seigerman reiterated his outperform rating on Amgen stock.


Amgen Stock Rises On Enbrel Decision
------------------------------------



The biggest [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) already expects Enbrel sales to erode over time. Enbrel generates about 22% of Amgen's total revenue and 25%-30% of its operating profit at a roughly 60%-70% operating margin, Porges said.


But the blockbuster drug first gained approval in 1998. Price compression, new innovative drugs and, eventually, biosimilars will erode Enbrel sales, Credit Suisse's Seigerman said. He calls for Enbrel sales to decline 8% on a compound annual basis over the next five years.


Meanwhile, other biosimilar-making biotech companies will likely think twice before taking on Amgen, CFRA analyst Kevin Huang said.


"While the decision does not preclude future aspiring Enbrel biosimilar manufacturers from contesting Amgen's Enbrel patents, we think that the recent decision will be a significant deterrent," he said in a report.


He raised his price target on Amgen stock by 20 to 215. He has a hold rating on Amgen stock.


Amgen Stock Ranks Ninth In Biotech Group
----------------------------------------


Amgen stock ranks No. 9 out of 543 stocks in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amgen-inc-amgn.aspx) tool. It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89, meaning it has outperformed 89% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.


The top stock in the biotech industry group is **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)). Celgene stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.


The biotech group ranks No. 60 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

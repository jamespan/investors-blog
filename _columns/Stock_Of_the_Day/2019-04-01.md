**Paylocity Holding** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the provider of payroll and human capital management software forms a flat base coming out of a deep cup chart pattern. Paylocity stock trades about 4% below a technical buy point.




Headquartered in Schaumburg, Ill., Paylocity's market in payroll and HCM software is crowded. Rivals include **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Cornerstone OnDemand** ([CSOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSOD)).


Paylocity has been grabbing customers from service bureaus **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)) and **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)), analysts say. It focuses on the small and midsize business market.


"We believe PCTY is well-positioned in the large payroll/HCM market, in particular due to its focus on SMBs," Jefferies analyst Samad Samana said in a recent report to clients. "Around 50% of PCTY's new business continues to come from the service bureaus, and the rest from a mix of local/regional payroll providers and from replacing in-house solutions."

Paylocity's nine straight quarters of revenue growth in the mid-20% range has helped shares.


Paylocity Cup Depth Could Be Issue
----------------------------------


Paylocity stock formed a cup chart pattern over nearly six months. The base had a depth of 40%.


That's a reason for caution. Bases with depths of more than 40% often are unable to meaningfully advance.


However, Paylocity has formed a flat base that could mitigate the depth of the cup chart pattern.


Shares in Paylocity rose a fraction to close at 89.27 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Paylocity stock has a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 92.60.


Paylocity Belongs To Hot Software Group
---------------------------------------


The stock is a member of the IBD Computer-Software Enterprise group. The group is [ranked No. 3](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-29-2019/) out of 197 industries.


Solid sponsorship is a strong point for Paylocity stock. Institutional investors include Columbia Acorn, Wasatch Core Growth, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity OTC Portfolio. Steven Beauchamp has served as chief executive since 2007, another sign of stability.


Terry Tillman, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, has a buy rating on Paylocity stock.


In a February report, Tillman said he expects Paylocity to "maintain solid business momentum, inclusive of consistent low-to-mid-20% recurring revenue growth, while expanding adjusted EBITDA margins well past 30% as the business achieves operating leverage"

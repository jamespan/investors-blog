**Logitech International** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of peripherals for PCs and mobile devices is seeing accelerating sales growth. Logitech stock is approaching record high territory after its monster March-quarter earnings report.




On April 29, the Lausanne, Switzerland-based company crushed Wall Street's targets for its [fiscal fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/logitech-stock-news-peripherals-maker-smashes-march-quarter-targets/) ended March 31. Logitech earned an adjusted $1.45 a share on sales of $1.54 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 83 cents a share on sales of $1.1 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Logitech earnings jumped 245% while sales increased 117%.


It was the company's third-straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth. Logitech also has posted six consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Logitech stock rose 3% to close at 119.60. Earlier in the session, it broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 117.24, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. It climbed as high as 119.85 on Wednesday. That's just below its all-time high of 120.24, reached on Feb. 16.


The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) for Logitech stock from its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) extends to 123.10, based on [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


Work-From-Home Trend Boosts Logitech Sales
------------------------------------------


Last year, the work-from-home and school-at-home trends during the Covid-19 pandemic boosted Logitech sales. The company continues to benefit from those trends as well as the expected hybrid work environments post-Covid.


"In our view, the pandemic is going to be a multiyear event and the market is currently treating it as binary (2020 — the year of the pandemic, and 2021 — the year of the recovery)," D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in a note to clients April 30. "For that reason, we see Logitech as well positioned for multiple years and not just calendar 2020."


Forte rates Logitech stock as buy with a price target of 135.


Logitech also plays in such burgeoning trends as esports, online video games, podcasting and video streaming.

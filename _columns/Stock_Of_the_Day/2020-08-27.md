**Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical** ([RARE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RARE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as analysts say the maker of treatments for ultrarare and life-threatening diseases has an attractive pipeline of drugs.




With three products already on the market and several more getting close, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical — with the apt ticker of RARE — is expected to double its sales for a second straight year.


Its growth and promise propelled RARE stock to 91.77 on July 8, its highest price since January 2016. RARE stock has formed a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 91.02.


Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical stock now is looking for support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). It closed solidly above that line on Thursday.


The Novato, Calif.-based company has focused on serious, debilitating genetic diseases since its start 10 years ago. It started recording revenue in 2018, with $50 million. Sales jumped to $100 million last year. Analysts polled by FactSet expect sales to reach $210 million this year and $330 million next year.

"We continue to view RARE's pipeline, diversified across development stage and disease indication, as attractive," Canaccord Genuity analyst Arlinda Lee said in a recent research note. She rates RARE stock at buy, with a price target of 92.


RARE Stock Sports High Composite Rating
---------------------------------------


Wedbush Securities rates RARE stock as outperform, with a 12-month price target of 95.


"Bottom line, we see RARE holding a strong combination of commercial execution, pipeline breadth and cash runway," Wedbush analyst Laura Chico wrote in a recent note. Ultragenyx has cash and equivalents of $817 million as of June 30.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), RARE stock rose 0.5% to 83.99. It has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92 out of 99. The rating shows how a stock's price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks.


RARE stock sports an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 88 out of 99. That puts it among the top 12% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical measures. However, the best growth stocks usually have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


In the second quarter, the biotech stock reported a rare profit. It posted earnings per share of 41 cents, swinging from a loss of $1.72 a share in the year-earlier period. However, analysts polled by FactSet expect losses to resume for at least the next three quarters. Sales jumped 124% to $61.7 million in the June quarter.


The company aims to address diseases with unmet medical needs for which there are no approved therapies.


Biotech Stock Got Third And Fourth Approvals In June
----------------------------------------------------


Its product Dojolvi treats patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders. It's the only such treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That approval just happened on June 30. LC-FAOD is a rare genetic disorder of fatty acid metabolism that can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as heart attacks.


Another drug, Crysvita, is a prescription medicine for adults and children 6 months of age and older with X-linked hypophosphatemia. XLH is a disease where the body doesn't retain enough phosphorus. Bones can weaken when there is not enough phosphorus.


In addition, the biotech stock and Tokyo-based partner Kyowa Kirin in June got approval for Crysvita to treat adults and children 2 years of age and older with fibroblast growth factor 23 — related hypophosphatemia in tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO, when the tumor cannot be located or removed.


Also, its Mepsevii treats children and adults with Mucopolysaccharidosis VII. Known as MPS VII or Sly syndrome, the disease is a progressive condition that affects most tissues and organs. Some affected individuals don't survive infancy, but others live into adulthood.


Dojolvi for LC-FAOD and Crysvita for TIO became the third and fourth approvals for Ultragenyx.


The biotech stock has promising gene therapy candidates in clinical trials, including a treatment for Hemophilia A. At least three other treatments for rare diseases are in clinical trials, with prospects analysts call promising.

**Shoals Technologies Group** ([SHLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLS)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The provider of solar power equipment recently raised $1.9 billion with an initial public offering that drew heightened attention in a hot market. Shoals stock approached a buy point in Friday trading.




Since its [IPO on Jan. 27](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shoals-ipo-initial-public-offering-solar-stocks-shls-fslr-enph-sedg/), Shoals stock has formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a buy point of 41.86. Shoals stock climbed 5.3% to close at 40.17 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Many IPO stocks stumble before they find their footing. Risks can be reduced and rewards reaped by waiting for IPO stocks to form their first base before investing.


Based in suburban Nashville, Tenn., Shoals provides an array of gear needed to operate solar energy systems, according to the [Shoals IPO filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1831651/000119312521015486/d801436ds1a.htm). Moreover, it provides the components needed to carry electric currents from solar panels to solar inverters and ultimately to the power grid. This includes cable assemblies, wireless monitoring systems, junction boxes, transition enclosures and splice boxes.

For its IPO, the company offered 77 million shares. Shoals stock priced at $25 each, above the expected price range of $22 to $23.


Shoals Stock Bolstered By Revenue, Earnings Growth
--------------------------------------------------


A big positive of Shoals is that it's profitable and growing at steady double-digit rates. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Shoals reported revenue of $136.7 million, up 28% from the year-ago period. Net income was $29.5 million vs. $17.3 million.


Solar stocks have rallied since the election of President Joe Biden, who made green energy initiatives a big part of his campaign. In addition, the outlook for solar stocks is bolstered by investors speculating on an [environmental infrastructure boom](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/renewable-energy-stocks-alternative-energy-zero-emissions/). Solar stocks that have benefited from the boom include **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)), **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)).


When it comes to investing in IPO stocks, new issues don't play by the usual rules. [New IPO stocks can be volatile](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-ipo-stocks-lessons-from-facebook-snap/), as **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and many others have shown.


Biggest Stock Market Winners
----------------------------


However, the biggest stock market winners typically make their major price moves within a few months or years of their IPO. So it pays to identify and track companies that are getting ready to go — or have recently gone — public, helping you to find the proper [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


IBD provides plenty of tools to help investors make smart choices. These tools include the home-study program [IPO Trading Strategies,](https://www.investors.com/product/home-study-kit-ipo-trading-strategies/) as well as the [IPO stocks to watch](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) feature. Further, IBD can keep you updated with [IPO news and analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) and help you learn how to trade [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).


No matter how much hype there might be surrounding a new company getting ready to go public, resist the temptation to buy a stock right when it has its IPO.


You can greatly reduce your risk and still reap big rewards by waiting for the stock to prove itself before you invest. As a rule, look for companies that have the [CAN SLIM traits of winning stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) and let it form an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) and break out first.


Investors studying IPO bases are partly blinded because new issues don't have enough trading history to generate tools like the Relative Price Strength Rating, as compiled in IBD's proprietary research tool, [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Volume comparisons are difficult, too.


Shoals Stock: Healthy IBD Composite Rating
------------------------------------------


In the case of Shoals, however, it already has a healthy [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94 out of a top score of 99. The best stocks will often rate 98 or 99 at the time they launch a big price run. The [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is 68. Ideally, look for stocks with a rating of 80 or higher.


IBD's Energy-Solar industry group tracks solar energy leaders. That group ranked a noteworthy No. 4 on IBD's list of 197 industry groups on Friday. The leading stocks in the group are Daqo New Energy, First Solar, Enphase and then Shoals.

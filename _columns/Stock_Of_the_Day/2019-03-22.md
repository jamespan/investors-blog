Q2 Stock Benefiting From 'Favorable Economic Environment'
---------------------------------------------------------


Its December-quarter earnings report showed a good acceleration in sales growth. Its revenue rose 30% year over year to $67.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared with 21% growth in the third quarter.


"A favorable economic environment supported record bookings for the platform business," Chief Executive Matt Flake said in the [earnings news release](http://investors.q2ebanking.com/investor-relations/news/investor-news/investor-news-details/2019/Q2-Holdings-Inc-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2018-Financial-Results/default.aspx). "We also meaningfully expanded our total addressable market through the acquisitions of Cloud Lending, a comprehensive lending and leasing platform, and Gro, a digital sales and onboarding solution."


He added, "The strength of our platform business combined with an expanded product offering gives me confidence we are poised to deliver accelerated revenue growth in 2019."


Earnings Forecast To Drop As Sales Surge In 2019
------------------------------------------------


Wall Street expects the company's revenue to rise at least 25% for the next four quarters. For the full year, Q2 Holdings forecast sales to grow 27% to $307 million. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance. Its sales rose 24% to $241.1 million in 2018.


Meanwhile, Q2 earnings are expected to sag in 2019 before rising again in 2020. Analysts forecast the company's adjusted earnings per share to fall 53% to 14 cents in 2019 and rise 243% to 48 cents in 2020.


On Feb. 28, KeyBanc Capital Markets reiterated its overweight rating on Q2 stock and raised its price target to 83 from 77. KeyBanc analyst Arvind Ramnani came away from the company's first investor day impressed with Q2's strategy.


"The company's continued product innovation has led to a significantly larger market opportunity," Ramnani said in a note to clients.


A number of large funds have added Q2 stock to their holdings, including Columbia Acorn Fund and Wasatch Core Growth Fund. New and added positions in the stock have outnumbered distribution of late by a factor of 172 to 104.

Paycom Software is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the provider of workforce management software nears a buy point, albeit with a [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) chart pattern and questionable institutional support. Paycom stock has consolidated since it reported second-quarter earnings on July 29.




While Paycom second-quarter earnings topped views, with guidance also above analyst estimates, the stock could be huffing and puffing after a strong run.


Paycom stock has nearly doubled in 2019. The maker of human resources and payroll-processing software is trading just below an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 246.95. Shares ended Monday's regular trading session up nearly 1% to 243.66.


Paycom's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 97 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). That's a bullish signal. That means it has outperformed 97% of all other stocks. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.

Paycom's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at new highs, also a bullish signal. IBD's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), drawn in blue in all [IBD charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) and in [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Paycom Stock: Institutional Support Weak?
-----------------------------------------


However, Paycom stock has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of D+. That's a red flag. The rating runs from a best possible A to a worst-possible E.


It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A declining Accumulation/Distribution Rating would be a clue that institutional buyers are bailing out.


Meanwhile, Paycom stock is forming its [first base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) since breaking out in February. It's a [fifth-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/), making a new entry riskier than normal.


Paycom EPS growth has modestly accelerated the last two quarters. Paycom's second-quarter adjusted earnings rose 27% to 75 cents a share, with revenue rising 31% to $169.3 million.


Analysts expected Paycom earnings of 70 cents on sales of $164 million for the period ended June 30.


For the September quarter, analysts estimate Paycom earnings growth of 29% to 67 cents a share.


Paycom Stock: Employee Self-Service Focus
-----------------------------------------


The provider of human-resources and payroll-processing software has expanded its direct-sales strategy by adding regional offices. That has enabled it to take more customers from service bureaus **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)) and **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)).


Paycom has focused on getting customers to adopt its "100% employee engagement" target. That means all changes to data in a company's human resources database are completed by employees.


Through the employee self-service initiative, Paycom aims to improve customer retention. Retention increased to 92% in 2018, up from 91% the prior year.


"The employee self-service sales model is working and seems a differentiating factor vs. competition," Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a recent report to clients. "The addition of a new inside sales force, announced this quarter, which can handle smaller clients and new geographies could be another driver."


In addition, the software maker has upped spending on a national marketing campaign. It also plans to spend more on research and development.


Oklahoma City-based Paycom ranks No. 7 on the [IBD 50 roster](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of fast-growing companies.

Churchill Downs CEO Eyes Illinois Expansion
-------------------------------------------


During the firm's last earnings call, CEO Bill Carstanjen said the Illinois Gaming Expansion Bill signed in late June offers opportunities. The law authorizes six new casinos in the state, and Carstanjen said Churchill Downs "expects to participate in a bid."


Carstanjen also said the firm's Rivers Casino in Des Plaines plans to exercise the right to expand from 1,200 gaming positions to 2,000. The CEO also said the bill gives its Arlington Park property the right to install up to 1,200 gaming positions, which include slot machines and table games.


The executive was also "excited about the potential of the Illinois sports wagering market," which both online and mobile, and brick-and-mortar opportunities.


In March 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that effectively banned sports betting in most states. The ruling has spurred several states to legalize or move to legalize sports betting.


Analyst Rates Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


JPMorgan analyst Daniel Politzer is rating Churchill Downs stock as neutral with a 140 target.


"CHDN is executing well across its existing businesses and has various opportunities ahead, especially as it relates to the Kentucky Derby and Illinois gaming expansion," he said in a Sept. 25 research note.


Politzer said there are "a number of growth levers ahead" such as more gaming positions at its Rivers Casino and the 2020 opening of a new facility in Oak Grove in southwestern Kentucky.

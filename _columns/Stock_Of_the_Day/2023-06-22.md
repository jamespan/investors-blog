**Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as investments in artificial intelligence are seen boosting sales of semiconductor equipment from Lam and others. LRCX stock is in a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern.




Lam Research along with chip-gear industry peers **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) are bouncing off their [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) lines.


On Thursday, LRCX stock rose above a recent pullback, offering a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 615.80. Also, a move above its June 14 high of 630.72 would offer an early entry within a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/), based on [IBD analysis](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), LRCX stock rose 2.3% to close at 619.87.


Lam Research Riding 'AI Wave'
-----------------------------


Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis on Tuesday raised his price target on LRCX stock to 575 from 475 but kept his equal-weight, or neutral, rating.


The "AI wave" will boost spending on leading-edge semiconductor capital equipment, lifting sales for Lam as well as Applied Materials and KLA, Curtis said.


"We still believe the semi cap correction is not over, but it's not often $150 billion falls into the model," he said in a note to clients. "We now model double-digit growth in the AI market through the end of the decade, reaching $100 billion in 2027, still short of AMD's recent $150 billion forecast."


On April 19, Lam Research topped Wall Street's targets for its [fiscal third quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lrcx-stock-lam-research-disappoints-with-outlook/) but disappointed with its outlook for the current period.

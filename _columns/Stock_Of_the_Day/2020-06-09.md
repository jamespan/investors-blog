**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares bound into a new buy zone.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), VRTX [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) surged 2.2% to close at 270.85. Shares bounced off their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), presenting a new buying opportunity. VRTX stock broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) in April, and spent the last two months skipping into and out of a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/).


Analysts have bullish expectations for Vertex revenue in 2020. CFRA analyst Kevin Huang calls for 37% sales growth after the biotech launched its newest cystic fibrosis drug, Trikafta. Trikafta gained Food and Drug Administration approval in October and accounted for 10% of last year's sales.


"We expect Trikafta sales, in its first full year, to surpass $3 billion," Huang said in a May note. He kept his buy rating and 297 price target on VRTX stock.

VRTX Stock Buoyed On Cystic Fibrosis Drugs
------------------------------------------


Vertex is a powerhouse in cystic fibrosis treatments. The company sells a total of four medicines with Trikafta being the latest to gain U.S. approval. Trikafta can treat up to 90% of patients with the lung-wasting disease. The remaining 10% will need another approach.


On the latter point, Vertex is working with **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) to develop a cystic fibrosis treatment for that 10%, JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a report last month. Kasimov has an overweight rating and 281 price target on VRTX stock.


Already, the majority of eligible patients have switched to treatment with Trikafta, he said. Vertex calls for Trikafta uptake among patients to mirror its older drugs. Next, the drug could gain approval in the U.S. and Europe in patients ages 12 and older. Then, it could be approved for patients ages 6-11.


It will begin "subsequently working down the age groups" in terms of approvals, he said.


Expanding Outside Of Cystic Fibrosis
------------------------------------


This year is also one of transition for VRTX stock.


Now that Vertex has gained Trikafta approval in the U.S., the [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) is moving beyond its sole focus on cystic fibrosis. A key piece of that effort lies in its plans to tackle alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD. AATD is a genetic disease that affects the liver and lungs.


Vertex estimates there are 100,000-200,000 people worldwide with severe AATD. Only about 10,000 of those patients receive what's known as augmentation therapy. In this therapy, patients receive blood plasma from healthy donors to augment the level of a deficient protein in the blood and lungs.


This is a $1 billion market. But it's also burdensome, requiring weekly infusions. Vertex hopes to solve those issues, Kasimov said.


The biotech also is working on gene-editing approaches to blood diseases with **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)). It's also targeting Type 2 diabetes after acquiring Semma Therapeutics.


Strong Rated Biotech Stock
--------------------------


Kasimov is positive on the long-term upside for Vertex in cystic fibrosis.


"Vertex's prevailing dominance in the (cystic fibrosis) space, potentially meaningful bottom-line leverage and advancing pipeline could sustain its competitive position and add to the company's overall strategic value," he said.


Notably, VRTX stock is also one of four biotech companies with a perfect Investor's Business Daily [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99. The rating puts VRTX stock in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical growth metrics.


Further, shares have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 89. The RS Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. This puts VRTX stock among the upper echelon of leaders with RS Ratings of 80 and above.


Representatives of Vertex didn't immediately return a request for comment.

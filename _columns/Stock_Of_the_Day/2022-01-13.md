**Ashland Global Holdings** ([ASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASH)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as shares of the specialty chemicals maker find support at a key level. ASH stock initially rose on Thursday, but then reversed.




Wilmington, Del.-based Ashland provides additives for the construction, pharmaceuticals and personal care industries. Its products enhance or improve a broad array of coatings, including batteries, cement, water-based paints, as well as creams and lotions, household disinfectants, and vitamins and medicines.


The company serves four main sectors: Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Life Sciences covers the pharmaceutical, nutrition and agricultural industries. Personal Care encompasses skin care, hair care, oral care and household items. Specialty serves the architectural coatings, construction and energy industries. And Intermediates covers electric vehicles, agricultural and pharma industries.


Among those segments, life sciences brought in 35% of the company's total $2.38 billion revenue for the fiscal year ended in September. Specialty adhesives were 31%. Personal care and household products generated 28% of the total. Regionally, about 36% of sales were in Europe, with 32% in North America and 23% in the Asia Pacific region.


Ashland's products are geared toward some core businesses of pharma, personal care and coatings. Then, it leverages these technologies to scale across multiple other markets.


"Our key engines are our core businesses ... that's where we invest most of the research," money said CEO Guillermo Novo in a November earnings call with investors. "But then, we have very strong positions in markets like nutrition, like construction, like in performance specialties, energy and resources. And we can adopt those technologies for those applications and get that needed scale."

**Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the lithium play shows signs of strength, coming off mixed third-quarter earnings this week. ALB shares advanced Friday, close to an early buy point.




Charlotte, N.C.-based Albemarle is the world's largest lithium producer and one of the biggest providers of lithium for electric batteries. The company already supplies the crucial metal to EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Along with its lithium segment, the chemical manufacturing company also has bromine and chemical catalyst divisions.


Albemarle stock is up about 15% for the year so far as lithium prices continue to be elevated. Lithium carbonate spot prices climbed to a record $80,000 per ton, up more than 190% from a year ago. The precious metal rose to 577,500 yuan per ton this week in China, the biggest EV market and a huge user of lithium.


The company announced on Oct. 19 that it had been awarded around $150 million worth of funds from President Joe Biden's infrastructure law to work on expanding U.S. lithium battery manufacturing.


Albemarle is also likely receive federal support through the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act, which includes millions of dollars in tax incentives for domestic battery technology. Albemarle has the only operating lithium mine in the U.S. currently.


Late Wednesday, the lithium producer [topped third-quarter earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/lithium-stocks-livent-earnings-albemarle-earnings-lthm-alb-stocks/) but missed on sales views. EPS surged 614% to $7.50 while revenue grew 152% to $2.1 billion. The company reported that its lower than expected revenue number was primarily a result of its bromine segment.


However, the company's lithium business surged 318% to $1.5 billion, or 72% of total company revenue.


Overall earnings and sales growth accelerated for a third straight quarter.


Albemarle had raised its full-year earnings forecast several times this year. But this time, ALB narrowed full-year revenue guidance to a range of $7.1 billion-$7.4 billion, with the top end slipping from $7.5 billion. The lithium giant also focused its full-year EPS guidance to $19.75-$21.75 vs. the previous $19.25-$22.25 range.

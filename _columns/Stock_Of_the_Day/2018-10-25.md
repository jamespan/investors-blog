**Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares sidestep a broad biotech sell-off.




The biotech sells vaccines for [various biological and infectious threats](https://emergentbiosolutions.com/products) including anthrax, smallpox, typhoid and cholera. It also makes treatments for anthrax poisoning, botulism, chemical threats and opioid overdose.


In August, Emergent Bio announced a $270 million plan to [acquire privately held PaxVax](http://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=202582&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2370392) to expand its efforts in infectious diseases. The following month, Emergent Bio unveiled a $735 million buyout of [private firm Adapt Pharma](http://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=202582&cat=news&id=2371735&p=RssLanding), which works in opioid overdoses.


The latter announcement helped Emergent Bio stock break out from a second-stage base. The company is in the early stages of its run after two years of consolidation. Emergent Bio stock advanced more than 3% to top a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 56.04 out of a flat base. Shares rose as much as 18.7% from that entry last month.

CLOSE




But the broader [pullback in the biotech market](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/biotech-companies-market-correction/) this month had Emergent Bio stock only 4.4% above that buy point as of Wednesday's close. Shares have declined 11.1% this month. Meanwhile, [shares of biotech companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) have plunged nearly 20%.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Emergent Bio stock jumped 3.1% to close at 60.33.


Acquisitions Bolster, Diversify Sales
-------------------------------------


Chardan analyst Keay Nakae was bullish on Emergent Bio's acquisition announcements in August and September. He sees PaxVax as aligning strategically with Emergent Bio's core strengths. Further, Adapt Pharma broadens and diversifies Emergent Bio's sources of revenue.


Adapt Pharma makes Narcan, a nasal spray that combats heroin or opioid overdoses. It competes against other forms of the drug, but Narcan is needle-free and less expensive.


"It can be purchased over the counter without a prescription at large chain drugstores at a cost around $130 to $140 for a kit that includes two doses, with lower pricing available to qualified group purchasers," Nakae said in a September note to clients.


He kept his buy rating and 66 private target on Emergent Bio stock.


Emergent Bio To Report Earnings
-------------------------------


Next up, Emergent Bio is set to report its [third-quarter earnings](http://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=202582&cat=news&id=2371215&p=RssLanding) after the close on Nov. 1. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for Emergent Bio to report adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share on $188 million in sales.


On a year-over-year basis, adjusted profit would decline from 73 cents a share in the [year-earlier period](http://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=202582&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2314090). The company's earnings have a tendency to be lumpy during certain quarters.


But sales would rise nearly 26% from $149.4 million. Emergent Bio has posted year-over-year sales growth for the past six quarters.


Emergent Bio stock has high ratings by IBD's standards. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 95 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it's ranked in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


It also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/) of 92 out of a top rating of 99. Emergent BioSolutions stock ranks second out of 516 biotech companies. It trails only **Biospecifics Technologies** ([BSTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSTC)), which has a CR of 96 and an RS Rating of 97.

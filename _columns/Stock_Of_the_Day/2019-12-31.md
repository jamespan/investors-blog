**StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the fast-growing, Warren-Buffett-backed Brazilian payments stock makes another run at a buy zone. This time, an X-factor turning from headwind to tailwind, or at least neutral, could make a difference for StoneCo stock.




StoneCo stock, a member of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list, seems to check a lot of boxes for growth stock investors: It is in the hot payments industry, with fast-growing revenue (55% in U.S. dollars) and profit (70%), and it's in the suddenly in-favor emerging-market sector. Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) is a notable StoneCo stock investor. So are several T. Rowe Price funds and several other A+ funds.


StoneCo stock has recently gotten the better of another 2018 Brazilian payments IPO, **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), in terms of share performance. But several other payments stocks — notably long-term leaders **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)) — have been performing better with less volatility.


StoneCo stock is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), along with Mastercard stock and Fiserv stock. Mastercard stock and Visa stock are in buy range. Fiserv stock is slightly extended.

StoneCo Stock Analysis
----------------------


Amid modest stock market gains Tuesday, StoneCo stock climbed 4% to 39.89, back above a 38.47 handle [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as well as an alternative entry of 39.55. Shares are peaking above a short-term trendline from late November. On a weekly chart, StoneCo stock is rebounding from its 10-week line.



StoneCo stock initially broke out past 38.47 and 39.55 on Nov. 22, following earnings. But after a few days, StoneCo stock tumbled below those entry levels. On Dec. 3, shares plunged as low as 35.03, undercutting the 50-day line and dropping nearly 9% from the 38.47 buy point. That would normally trigger the 7%-8% automatic sell rule, but shares almost immediately rebounded, to close higher. Since then, shares have been trading around the buy point. Trading has been relatively tight in recent weeks, especially for the volatile StoneCo stock.


At the end of this week, Stone Co stock likely will have another short base, with a potential 41.98 entry.



Brazil Currency, Economy On The Mend
------------------------------------


StoneCo has seen explosive growth despite Brazil's economic struggles. But the macro picture could be turning more helpful. Brazil's economy grew 0.6% in the third quarter, the fastest since Q1 2018. Brazil's currency, the real, dived to a record low against the dollar in late November — just days after the third-quarter StoneCo earnings report. That took the real 16% below its level vs. the dollar when StoneCo went public.


In recent weeks, the dollar has softened against international currencies, including about 5% vs. the real. That's happened as the U.S. and China sealed a trade deal expected to take pressure off the global economy. Meanwhile, the Fed said it didn't expect any rate hikes before 2021 as policymakers aim to stoke inflation past the 2% official target.


Brazil Payments Stocks
----------------------


StoneCo stock and PagSeguro stock are leading Brazil's payments sector, with plenty of encouragement from the government. A relatively low 40% of Brazil consumption is paid for with debit and credit cards. The government, with an eye on collecting more taxes, has a mandate of 60% within three years.


Brazil also has an unbanked population of around 60 million. Many of them use official boleto vouchers — a form of printable scrip — to make payments. On top of that, merchant transactions traditionally take 30 days to settle, and customers habitually opt to pay in installments.


StoneCo Momentum
----------------


That helps explain why StoneCo's business of providing the digital infrastructure to modernize Brazil's retail sector is surging. StoneCo added 68,700 small and midsize business customers in the third quarter, lifting its total to 428,900. That includes about 100,000 — up 30,000 from Q2 — that use StoneCo software solutions to handle accounting and run other aspects of their businesses, both online and off.


Now StoneCo is seizing the opportunity to gain market share in financial services. In March, the company started providing working capital to its customers. Through Q2, it had disbursed loans to 3,000 clients. That jumped to 13,000 by the end of Q3.


StoneCo earnings surged 900%, 467%, 467%, 157% and 70% in the last five quarters. Sales growth has cooled to a still-hot 55% in the third quarter. Analysts expect StoneCo earnings to soar 93% for the full year and a robust 43% in 2020.


Other Payments Stocks
---------------------


PagSeguro stock rose 2.7% to 34.16 on Tuesday, moving back above its falling 50-day line. Shares are still well below its August all-time high of 53.43.


Mastercard stock edged up 0.3%, Visa stock added 7 cents and Fiserv stock gained 0.1%. Fiserv is just beyond the 5% chase zone.

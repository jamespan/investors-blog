Shares in Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), have rallied some 39% in 2021. But the big run of Google stock may not be over, as shares have grabbed a new entry point amid its relative strength line notching new highs.




With 2021's gain, Alphabet stock has outperformed other FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) — as well as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). GOOGL stock bulls trumpet a rebound in digital advertising as Covid-19 vaccinations expand, boosting global economies as industries such as travel normalize.


While the internet search business still drives advertising growth, Google also is getting a boost from its cloud computing business and video website YouTube. Unlike Netflix, YouTube's revenue comes from advertising while it's also building up subscription fees.


In e-commerce, Google aims to be a stronger rival to Amazon through partnerships with **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)).


Google Stock: Artificial Intelligence Strength
----------------------------------------------


Google stock's strength in artificial intelligence spans digital advertising, the [Google Cloud Platform](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-cloud-computing-contract-starlink/), YouTube and consumer hardware products. At a Google developers conference in mid-May, the company demonstrated how it uses AI tools in a wide range of applications, including Google Workspace, Google Maps, virtual reality, voice-based search and photos.


"We continue to be impressed with Google's technology innovation and AI leadership," Bank of America analyst Justin Post said in a review of Google's I/O developer conference.


Google is one of many [artificial intelligence stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) to watch.


At the conference, Google also disclosed that its Android operating system for mobile devices now has 3 billion users worldwide. GOOGL stock broke out to an all-time high on April 5 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Alphabet's favor in a copyright dispute with **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) involving Android mobile software.


Google stock also popped after Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that blew past estimates. The company also authorized $50 billion in additional GOOGL stock buybacks.


GOOGL Stock Forges Flat Base
----------------------------


From a technical view, Google stock has consolidated and forged a flat base entry point of 2,431.48. As of June 4, it trades 2% below that proper buy point.


But Google stock at one point on Friday traded above its June 2 high of 2,393.73, giving aggressive investors an earlier buy point. GOOGL stock withstood a test of its 10-week moving average. It also is back above its three-weeks-tight entry. Shares climbed 2% Friday to close at 2,393.57.


Google stock holds an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a best possible 99.


The Composite Rating is a blend of the other five IBD stock ratings: the earnings per share or EPS Rating, Relative Price Strength Rating, Accumulation/Distribution Rating, Industry Group Relative Strength Rating and the SMR Rating. The latter measures sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. The all-encompassing Composite Rating helps investors easily measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


Also, Google stock belongs to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/?). The Leaderboard is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.


Google Growth Accelerates As Coronavirus Crisis Ebbs In U.S.
------------------------------------------------------------


Rebounding from the coronavirus pandemic, Google's earnings and revenue growth has accelerated for three quarters.


Google earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, rose 166% to 26.29 per share in the first quarter. That included gains on equity investments.


Gross revenue, which excludes traffic acquisition costs, [jumped 34% to $55.31 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-google-earnings-googl-q12021/).


The Department of Justice on Oct. 20 filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. The Justice Department charged that Google has harmed competition and consumers by monopolizing internet search and search-related advertising. A legal battle likely will drag on for years.


According to [IBD MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/?), GOOGL stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of 76 out of a best possible 99. But its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/) is at new highs.

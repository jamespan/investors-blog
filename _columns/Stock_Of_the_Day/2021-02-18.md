[Wells Fargo stock](https://www.investors.com/research/wells-fargo-stock-buy-now/) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the bank holds in a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) after reportedly showing progress toward eventually ending limits on its size.




The bullish signal comes after the lender had been scarred for years by a scandal involving the creation of fake consumer accounts.


Other bank stocks, like **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), have also rebounded in recent months, as the coronavirus vaccine rollout lifted hopes of a broader economic recovery.


But while bank stocks tend to do well with the economy, they rarely outperform the broader market for extended periods.


Wells Fargo Stock
-----------------


Wells Fargo stock rose 1% to close at 36.96 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). That followed a 5% gain on Wednesday, when shares first cleared a 35.20 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a short consolidation. The stock is right on the edge of the buy zone, which tops out at exactly 36.96.


The relative strength line has also spiked, clearing a short-term high. Shares, which were added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Wednesday, have gapped above an upward-sloping 50-day average, another bullish signal.


However, **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) is still far from the highs it reached in 2018. And its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is a weak 29, of a possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) stands at 24. Investors could sell the stock once it reaches 50, roughly where it was trading at a year ago.


The boost for Wells Fargo stock came after Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/wells-fargo-wins-fed-acceptance-for-overhaul-plan-tied-to-cap?sref=6RafMK8w) on Wednesday that Federal Reserve officials "privately signaled" that they accept Wells Fargo's proposal to repair its risk management and governance practices.


The Fed in 2018 placed limits on Wells Fargo's size in the wake of the scandal, in which the bank for years created millions of phony accounts in consumers' names in an effort to hit sales goals. The scandal led to scrutiny of some of Wells Fargo's other businesses, executive departures and settlements.


Over that time, Wells Fargo stock has lagged other bank stocks. And Wells Fargo has more work to do before the Fed's asset cap can be lifted.


As Raymond James analysts explained, the bank has to complete four steps to remove the cap. It completed the first — submitting plans to improve governance — in September. The Fed's acceptance of those plans, as reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday, would be the second. The bank also has to execute those plans and undergo outside review.


"We believe the earliest that the cap would be removed would be late 2021 but believe that it is most likely a 2022 event," the Raymond James analysts said in a research note on Wednesday.

Bank Stocks Rebound
-------------------


The rebound for Wells Fargo stock and other bank stocks comes as growth stocks remain shaky.


The yield curve — which looks at the gap on rates on short-term and long-term government debt — has steepened, indicating longer-term economic optimism.


While the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program and efforts to keep interest rates low have helped the economy, low interest rates hurt banks' profits. But that hasn't stopped other bank stocks from making bullish moves.


JPMorgan stock also recently moved into a buy zone, clearing a 141.20 entry earlier this week. And Goldman Sachs was added to [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) on Wednesday as well.

NLight Earnings Beat Drives LASR Stock Higher
---------------------------------------------


LASR stock has been on a run since it hit an all-time low of 9.04 in March during the coronavirus stock market crash.


NLight stock is technically [extended](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/extended--op-in-price-cp-) beyond the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) of its recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). However, on Wednesday it hit an alternate buy point of 33.22 from a short consolidation, according to IBD chart analysis. That new buy point is an aggressive entry, so any position taken there should be small.


The Vancouver, Wash.-based company surprised investors on Nov. 5 with its September-quarter results. NLight earned an adjusted 12 cents a share on sales of $61.7 million in the [third quarter](https://investors.nlight.net/news-releases/news-details/2020/nLIGHT-Inc.-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx). Analysts expected NLight earnings of a penny a share on sales of $57.3 million. In the year-earlier period, NLight earnings were 1 cent a share on sales of $43.8 million.


For the fourth quarter, NLight guided to sales of $59 million to $65 million. The midpoint of $62 million would represent year-over-year growth of 45%. That would be its fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating sales growth after 41% growth in the September quarter.


Aerospace And Defense Market Fuels Sales Growth
-----------------------------------------------


NLight makes high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers used in the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets. Aerospace and defense accounted for 42% of the company's third-quarter revenue. Industrial markets contributed 35% of sales, with microfabrication bringing in the remaining 23%.


In November 2019, NLight bulked up its business with the acquisition of privately held Nutronics. NLight estimated that the acquisition of Nutronics would add $25 million to $40 million to its 2020 sales.


"The key driver of our performance in the third quarter was the strong execution of our strategy, which is focused on two core areas: increasing sales from key industrial customers outside of China and continued focus on the A&D (aerospace and defense) end market," Chief Executive Scott Keeney said on a Nov. 5 conference call with analysts.


The company's aerospace and defense revenue rocketed 123% year over year in the third quarter. Excluding Nutronics business, aerospace and defense revenue rose 44% in the period, Needham analyst James Ricchiuti said in a note to clients.


LASR Stock Ranks Fourth In Its Industry Group

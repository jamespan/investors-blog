**Inari Medical** ([NARI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NARI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares eye a fresh buy point. Shares of NARI stock have almost quadrupled since hitting Wall Street in May.




This comes amid an inflection point for mechanical intervention in blood clots, Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis said in a late October report. Inari makes catheter-like mechanical devices that physicians can use to suck blood clots out of veins.


NARI stock touched a record high on Aug. 31. Then, through Oct. 28, shares pulled back nearly 31% as the coronavirus pandemic continued to weigh on medical device companies. Despite that, Inari managed to tack on top- and bottom-line growth in the third quarter.


Morgan Stanley's Lewis calls Inari an "innovator in a multibillion-dollar market." The company competes against medical devices giant **Boston Scientific** ([BSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSX)) and smaller company **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)), which filed its initial public offering five years ago.

"We continue to view greater thrombectomy innovation, education, and referral channel investment as a tide lifting all boats," he said. "Awareness of mechanical intervention and currently limited physician adoption (are) the primary barriers to faster growth and market penetration by both Inari and Penumbra today."


NARI Stock Rockets Off IPO
--------------------------


Shares of NARI stock went public at 19 in May. They closed that day at 42.51 â€” nearly 124% higher than the initial public offering price. The medical devices company raised about $179 million after selling more than 9.4 million shares.


Inari sells two devices that remove blood clots from veins, usually in the leg, arm or groin. The firm's devices, known as the ClotTriever and FlowTriever, go for $7,000 and $10,000, respectively. Inari sells to hospitals which then receive reimbursement from insurance companies and Medicare.


During the third quarter, Inari generated adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share, up from a 1-cent per-share gain in the year-earlier period. Sales were small at $26.5 million, but rocketed 86% year over year.



Importantly, the sales growth came amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many medical companies have struggled amid the pandemic as patients delay treatments to avoid hospital exposure. Inari's devices aim to replace clot-busting drugs known as thrombolytic or lytic medications.


Shares Eye A New Buy Point
--------------------------


In its massive initial offering on May 22, NARI stock more than doubled off its IPO price of 19. Since that first close, NARI stock has climbed 71% as of midday action on Nov. 13, nearly four times the IPO price. That puts it leaps and bounds ahead of the Medical-Products industry group, where it trades. As a whole, the group has popped almost 24% over the same time period.


Altogether, it's given NARI stock a bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 92 out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating is a 1-99 measure of a stock's 12-month performance. So, shares rank in the top 8% of all stocks on that metric.


Now, NARI stock is forming a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 82.93. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-market-today/), shares slid 1.7% to 73.58.


Morgan Stanley's Lewis gives NARI stock an outperform rating and a price target of 76.


"The recent pullback and our positive bias on (financial) numbers creates an attractive entry point," he said.


Representatives of Inari didn't immediately return a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.

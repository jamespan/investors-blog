One Medical brand clinics operator **1Life Healthcare** ([ONEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONEM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the 2020 IPO flirted with its second breakout of the year.




San Francisco-based One Medical is not yet profitable and the resurgence of coronavirus cases could hurt results this year if people steer clear of the doctor. But the company has been winning believers and price-target hikes, and its business model has proved its durability and it's gotten stronger amid the Covid-19 pandemic.


One Medical launched its IPO at the end of January, pricing at 14 a share. In Friday afternoon [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), One Medical stock rose 3.8% to settle at 41.60, after earlier clearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 42.10. ONEM stock hit a record 43.20 intraday.


One Medical Business Model
--------------------------


One Medical calls itself a "membership-based and technology-powered primary care platform with seamless digital health and inviting in-office care." The company has clinics in 10 cities and has announced plans to expand to three more.


At the end of 2019, membership was nearly split between individual consumers and enterprise customers. Nearly half of revenue came from membership fees and payments from health network partners who serve One Medical members as of Q4. The rest comes from in-office and digital services. But that latter portion began to suffer in March after coronavirus shutdowns slowed in-office visits.


In April, total utilization across all billable services, which includes in-office volumes, remote visits and coronavirus testing, averaged approximately 55% of pre-COVID levels, the company said.


Fees Seen Rebounding
--------------------


Eventually, fees for in-clinic health visits should rebound, but the Covid-19 resurgence raises risk as to the timing.


On May 13, One Medical reported a Q1 adjusted EBITDA loss of $13.5 million, or 40 cents per share on an unadjusted basis. Revenue grew 25% to $78.76 million. Membership was 455,000 at the end of the quarter, also up 25%.


One Medical says that its business model delivers a payoff for enterprise customers. On the earnings call, the company touted a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. One Medical members tracked in the study had 45% lower total medical and prescription claims costs, amounting to $167 per member per month.


One Medical Adapts To Coronavirus
---------------------------------


While One Medical offered Q2 guidance that was a bit light, it raised its year-end membership target range to 500,000-515,000 from a March estimate of 495,000-510,000 members.


"Even with rising levels of unemployment, we remain confident in our value proposition to members," CFO Bjorn Thaler said.


In responding to the coronavirus, One Medical launched billable telemedicine visits and has helped facilitate testing, collecting patient specimens via 18 outdoor testing sites and designated respiratory care clinics. It also launched virtual behavioral health consultations and a worksite reentry program to help employers safely transition workers back to shared spaces.


"While we face uncertainty, particularly in Q2, we believe our collective initiatives can position us to emerge from the pandemic with more members, more brand loyalty, a broader portfolio of services and lower capital intensity, all of which should provide long-term tailwinds to both revenue and margins," Thaler said.


Remote visits will let One Medical reduce its physical footprint per member, he explained.


One Medical Stock
-----------------


One Medical stock went on a 37% run over five trading days starting May 14, after Q1 results showed off its resilience. Initial IPO breakouts can be powerful moves. But after clearing a 28.68 buy point, and peaking at 42, One Medical fell back all the way to 28.


But ONEM stock found support near the top of its old base and at its 10-week moving average.


Now One Medical has set up for another potential breakout. While it doesn't have an earnings track record, it has solid growth prospects.


The chart also offers another indication that One Medical stock could continue to be a leader: Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the chart below, just hit a new high, reflecting its superior performance to the S&P 500.



How Profitable Are Physician Clinics?
-------------------------------------


One Medical still has some convincing to do. In a July 1 research note, SVB Leerink analyst Stephen Tanal started ONEM stock coverage with a market perform rating and 36 price target, citing uncertainty over its path to profitability.


In a Thursday research note discussing **Walgreens** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), which announced a plan to house 500-700 full-service clinics in coming years, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut questioned "whether the 'doc in a box' model is the right move given 1) the poor profitability track record of retail clinic models, 2) broader earnings challenges faced by primary care providers (even hospital-owned practices lose money on a stand-alone basis), and 3) emerging competition and site-of-service shift caused by the increased adoption of telemedicine."


Bottom line: One Medical isn't just trying to disrupt the physician clinic model, it's trying to turn a profit-challenged model into a cash cow.

**Carrier Global** ([CARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARR)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the heating and air conditioning giant keeps momentum after last week's earnings beat. CARR cleared a buy point after nearly a nine-month consolidation. Buybacks, strategic deals and artificial intelligence are drivers.




The Building-A/C & Heating Products group is acting well, with a number of stocks acting well, including **AAON** ([AAON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAON)), **Comfort Systems** ([FIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIX)) and **Lennox International** ([LII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LII)).


Carrier Stock Buybacks
----------------------


Carrier, which was a 2020 spinoff of United Technologies but really dates back to 1915, is in the midst of a period of rapid change. In April 2023, Carrier announced a $13 billion deal to buy Viessmann Climate Solutions of Germany, whose heat pumps, solar and battery technologies make it a key player in Europe's energy transition. Meanwhile, Carrier has been selling off noncore businesses.


In March, Carrier agreed to sell its industrial fire business for $1.425 billion. In December, **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) agreed to buy Carrier's Global Access Solutions business for $4.95 billion. More business exits are in the pipeline for Carrier.


In an earnings statement last Thursday, Carrier CEO David Gitlin said that proceeds from the coming transactions will allow for the resumption of CARR stock buybacks this year as net leverage falls to two times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.


Carrier posted Q1 earnings per share of 62 cents, up 19% from a year ago and 11 cents ahead of estimates. Sales rose 17% to $6.2 billion, with a 16% boost due to the Viessmann acquisition and modest organic growth.


Carrier reported an adjusted operating margin of 15%, up from 12.2% a year ago.


'Outsized' AI Opportunity
-------------------------


"Our formula is working," Gitlin said on the April 25 earnings call. "Drive productivity, tenaciously simplify the business, reduce overhead, invest in growth, all while increasing margins."


One of those growth areas is the data center market for the HVAC business. Artificial intelligence offers "an outsized opportunity for cooling providers, given that AI chips drive seven times the heat generation vs. traditional chips," Gitlin said. He sees the data center HVAC market growing from $7 billion in 2023 to $15 billion-$20 billion in 2027.


Carrier Stock
-------------


Carrier popped 3.65% to 62.71 in Monday [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), clearing a 60.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a seven-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). Given the failed breakout attempt on March 8, the recent consolidation was really an extension of a long consolidation dating back to last August.


On Thursday, CARR stock charged ahead 9.2%, gapping above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). That move above the 50-day broke a trendline sloping down from March highs, offering an [early entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-spotting-early-entries-on-potential-breakouts/) opportunity, though a fleeting one. Carrier stock is now about 10% above its 50-day.


However, the buy zone from the flat-base buy point is still actionable up through 63.91.


Meanwhile, AAON stock popped 3%, hitting a record high and exiting a buy zone. AAON reports earnings on Thursday.


Comfort Systems climbed 2.1% and Lennox was just above break-even on Monday, both moving off 50-day lines within recent consolidations. Both had whipsaw reactions to earnings last week.

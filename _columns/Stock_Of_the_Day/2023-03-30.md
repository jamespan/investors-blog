**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the sports-gambling portal offers an early entry as it forges a new base. DKNG stock reversed higher Thursday.




The Boston-based sports-gambling enterprise went public with the DKNG ticker in April 2020. DraftKings still hasn't turned a profit, and analysts expecting that to continue until 2026. Institutional investors remain skeptical of DraftKings stock, with nearly 300 funds jumping ship in 2022, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


However, sports-betting prospects look strong with around 20% of U.S. adults saying they bet money on sports in some way in the last 12 months, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey. The American Gaming Association reports that commercial betting industry saw record revenue in 2022.


AGA data shows January 2023 revenue from sports betting and iGaming totaled $1.5 billion. Sports betting revenue grew 58% vs. last year while iGaming increased 21% vs. January 2022.


On Feb. 16, DKNG topped fourth-quarter estimates, reporting a smaller-than-expected loss. The company lost 53 cents per share vs. an 80-cent loss a year earlier. Meanwhile, DraftKings Q4 revenue grew 81% to $855 million.


On the year, DraftKings reported a loss of $3.16 per share as revenue grew 73% to $2.24 billion. Analysts see DraftKings revenue growth continuing, averaging an annual increase of 22% through 2026.

CLOSE




Waltham-Mass.-based Dynatrace went public Aug. 1, backed by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Its initial public offering raised $570 million, with shares priced at 16.


Dynatrace Stock: Thoma Bravo Reduces Stake
------------------------------------------


Dynatrace on Dec. 3 announced a follow-up offering, with Thoma Bravo further reducing its stake. Dynatrace's stock fell 12% over the seven trading days. The offering of 27.5 million shares at 24.75 closed on Dec. 10. Thoma Bravo owned a 61% stake following the secondary offering, down from the 71% it had post-IPO.


It's not unusual for secondary offerings to pressure new IPOs because of equity dilution and questions over the exit strategies of controlling shareholders.


In the case of Thoma Bravo, it has become a [specialist in acquiring technology and software](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/thoma-bravo-dealmaking-fundraising-2020) companies. Compuware acquired Dynatrace in 2011 for around $250 million from a group of venture capital backers. Thoma Bravo then bought Compuware for $2.4 billion in 2014 and carved out Dynatrace.


Rival Software Stocks: Cisco, New Relic, Splunk
-----------------------------------------------


Thoma Bravo continues to be one of the most aggressive private equity investors in software stocks. The buyout shop bought cybersecurity firm Imperva in 2019 for $2.1 billion, as well as ConnectWise and Veracode.


Dynatrace's software tools measure and analyze the performance of business-critical applications. It competes in the application performance monitoring market vs. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)). Cisco acquired AppDynamics in 2017 to enter the market.


In the most recent quarter, reported on Oct. 30, year-over-year earnings grew 100% to 6 cents per share. Meanwhile, revenue grew 27% to $129.4 million. The company lost 11 cents per share of Dynatrace stock in the fiscal year ended in March.


Dynatrace Converting Customers To Subscriptions
-----------------------------------------------


Dynatrace has steadily converted on-premise customers to subscription-based cloud products. September-quarter subscription revenue rose 41% to nearly $116 million.


Dynatrace says it has more than 2,300 customers in more than 70 countries. They're in diverse industries such as banking, insurance, retail, manufacturing, travel and software. Dynatrace's customers include **Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), Experian, Air Canada and **Daimler** ([DDAIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDAIF)).


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/Register/CampaignRegister.aspx?id=CUP&src=A00259A), Dynatrace stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 83 out of a best-possible 99. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. An upward-trending RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


The IPO's lockup period expires Jan. 28, which will open the door to insiders selling shares.

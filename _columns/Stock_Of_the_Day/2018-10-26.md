**CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the world's most active futures exchange remains in a buy range and continues to outperform despite the market correction.







The company on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations. But revenue missed. Still, the stock's relative strength line was at highs not seen since 2009. The RS line measures a stock's performance against the S&P 500.


CME Group stock rose 0.7% to 178.64 in the [stock market today.](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) The stock is a 3.8% above the base's 172.09 entry from a double-bottom base. Stocks that rise beyond 5% of a base's buy point are considered too far extended to represent a purchasing opportunity.


During a market correction, investors should be extremely cautious about any purchases. But stocks that hold up in a down market overall can emerge as leaders when the broader rally resumes.


CME Group stock is up 23% so far this year, though the chart action has been choppy. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index are both in negative territory for 2018.

IBD Stock Of The Day Poised For Growth
--------------------------------------


Zacks analysts say CME Group — the product of a merger between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade roughly a decade ago — is poised for growth, helped by its diverse derivative securities offerings.


"Efforts to expand and cross-sell its core exchange-traded business via new product initiatives and global reach also support growth," Zacks says. "It intends to exit its credit default swap clearing business by mid-2018 and focus on over-the-counter clearing services on interest rate swaps as well as foreign exchange."

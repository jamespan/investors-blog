**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. Delta Air Lines expects strong growth in 2023 as the travel market recovery continues. DAL stock climbed Wednesday above a buy point as traders digested the day's news from the Federal Reserve.




Despite some harsh weather and technology [disruptions during the holiday season](https://www.investors.com/news/faa-computer-outage-halts-all-u-s-flights/), airline travel rebounded in 2022. That momentum is expected to carry into 2023. [The World Economic Forum predicts](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/12/when-will-air-travel-return-to-pre-pandemic-levels/) North American airlines will fully recover their pre-pandemic ridership levels by the end of the year.


"The industry backdrop for air travel remains favorable, and Delta is well-positioned to deliver significant earnings and cash-flow growth," Delta CEO Ed Bastian said during the company's [Q4 earnings results on Jan. 13.](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-earnings-q4-dal-stock/)


For the quarter, Delta Air Lines' earnings soared 573% to $1.48 per share and revenue surged 42% to $13.44 billion. That handily beat Wall Street estimates for earnings per share of $1.32 on 36% revenue growth to $12.92 billion. The results marked three quarters of earnings growth and four straight quarters of sales growth.


For fiscal 2023, Delta forecasts "significant" earnings growth to $5 to $6 per share, from $3.20 in 2022. Revenue is seen rising 15% to 20%, to a range of $52.44 billion to $54.72 billion. FactSet analysts expect 64% earnings growth to $5.26 per share on $53.49 billion in revenue.


However, Delta also tempered expectations, projecting non-fuel-unit costs and labor costs would increase during the first quarter. Delta guided Q1 earnings to a range of 15 cents to 40 cents per share, vs. Wall Street predictions of 59 cents.


Still, Delta stock is up 21% so far in 2023.


**American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) andÂ  **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) also are big recent winners. Shares of **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), which had a massive computer malfunction that grounded thousands of flights in December, rose modestly in January. LUV stock is stuck below key moving averages.

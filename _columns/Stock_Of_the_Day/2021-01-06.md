The weight-loss stock surged 9.5% to 218.13 Wednesday to clear a 208.67 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).Â The flat base is part of a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/), following a prior cup-with-handle base.


The buy zone extends to 219.10.

The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) made a new high as Medifast stock broke out, a bullish sign.

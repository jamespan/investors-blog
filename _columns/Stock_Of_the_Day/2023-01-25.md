ONON Stock
----------



ONON stock is working up the right side of a 24-week [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-bottoming-base-part-2-how-apple-showed-unusual-strength/). Bottoming bases are similar to cup bases, except they often form within a deep consolidation. Shares have climbed back above the stock's [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), reclaiming that level on Jan. 11.

ONON stock is trading about 14% below the base's 25.10 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).

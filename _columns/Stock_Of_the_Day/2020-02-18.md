RH stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after soaring into a buy zone on the news that legendary investor Warren Buffett took a bigger stake in the luxury furniture chain.




**Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) disclosed late Friday that its **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) holdings grew by 41% in Q4 to 1.71 million shares. When Berkshire, led by Buffett, disclosed it took an initial position of 1.2 million shares in Q3, RH stock spiked 7.6% on Nov. 16.


Individual investors use the regulatory data to gauge where the "smart money" is placing its bets. Note that 13F filings show holdings at the end of each quarter, and hedge funds may have made changes to stock positions since then.


As other retailers try to figure out how to operate in the digital world carved out by **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), RH has doubled down on brick and mortar. Its upscale physical retail spaces — sometimes with their own restaurants — are complemented by thick print catalogs that offer enticing images of its merchandise to customers.

Back in December the firm expanded its footprint further by with the opening of RH Columbus. The three-level store takes up 60,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space, and boasts lush garden courtyards and terraces, as well as an in-house interior design firm. At the last count the firm operated a total of 70 RH Galleries and 39 RH outlet stores.

RH Stock Gets Buffett Boost
---------------------------


Shares in the retailer formerly known Restoration Hardware rose 5.8% to 252.10 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). RH stock cleared a 10-week consolidation, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The ideal buy point is 243.77. This is a new buy area for the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock.


[SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) added RH stock on Tuesday.


Aggressive investors already had a couple of opportunities to buy RH stock in recent days. Shares cleared an early entry of 229.80 on Feb. 11. The prior session, RH stock rebounded from its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) and 10-week moving average and broke a short, downward-sloping trend line.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is also looking positive again after taking a brief breather. Broadly speaking, the RS line has been making strong progress since June, indicating outperformance of the S&P 500.


RH stock has a near-perfect [Composite Rating of 98](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a top notch [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 98. RH earnings are very strong, with the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-r-h-rh.aspx) showing EPS has grown by an average of 119% over the past three years. This is far above the [25% growth sought by CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). RH earnings growth has accelerated in the past two quarters, from 53% to 59% and 74%. But sales growth has generally been at 10% or less.


The reason a top institutional investor like Buffett is backing RH stock is important, as the I in CAN SLIM stands for [Institutional Sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/check-for-institutional-sponsorship/). Professional investors account for about 75% of all market activity, and are thus key to big stock moves. RH is being heavily backed, with almost 65% of its stock currently being held by institutional shareholders. Berkshire Hathaway is the fourth biggest holder, behind Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock.



Berkshire Also Places These Bets
--------------------------------


Buffett bought shares of **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) in the fourth quarter, but the legendary investor further pared his **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) stakes.


Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stakes in Apple by 3.7 million shares, a 1% cut. In Wells Fargo it trimmed 55 million shares, a 14% cut. And it sold off more than 2 million shares in **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), a fractional cut.


It left stakes in other top 10 stocks in its portfolio unchanged. The 13F filings showed Berkshire Hathaway also left **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which it first bought in Q1 2019, unchanged.


In Q4, the Buffett-run company took new positions in Kroger and Biogen. It bought nearly 19 million shares of Kroger, worth around $549 million, and roughly 649,000 shares of Biogen, worth $192 million.

**Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the specialty drug company works on two buy points. Blockbuster sales of a rare-disease drug boosted shares to record highs recently.




The Ireland-based biotech, which is also on the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), develops therapeutics for the treatment of rare and rheumatic diseases. The commercial launch of Tepezza, used to treat thyroid eye disease (TED), has helped boost revenue.


TED is a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune disease, with Tepezza the first and only FDA-approved treatment.

Earnings, Outlook
-----------------


The Tepezza launch was "one of the most successful rare disease medicine launches ever, despite a challenging Covid-19 environment," according to the company.


The drug drove 44% revenue growth in the second quarter and a second straight quarter of accelerating sales.


On Aug. 5, Horizon Therapeutics stock gapped up 24% to an all-time high after Q2 earnings beat estimates. The company also hiked earnings and sales guidance citing Tepezza sales that have "dramatically exceeded expectations."


It forecasts revenue of $1.85 billion-$1.9 billion for the full year, up sharply from a prior view for $1.4 billion-$1.45 billion. It expects 2020 profit before interest and taxes of $725 million-$775 million vs. $450 million-$500 million earlier.


Meanwhile, analysts expect earnings for all of fiscal 2020 to jump 47% to $2.86, and increase a further 50% in 2021. Sales are likely to rise 48% in 2020 and 44% in 2021.


That would compare to 19% annual EPS growth over the past three years and 13% annual sales growth, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).

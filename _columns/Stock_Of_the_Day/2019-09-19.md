**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as demand for after-school tutoring grows in the Chinese and U.S. markets. EDU stock has formed a new base with a fresh buy point as its ascent continues.




The private tutoring service provider and [IBD 50 stock](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) serves more than 8 million students through a network of 95 schools and 1,233 learning centers.


EDU Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------


New Oriental shares rose 2% to finish at 113.11 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), eyeing a 115.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) off an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/), which is a rare pattern that tends to produce powerful winners. Typically, it marks out a strong stock in a not-so-strong market.


EDU stock is up 20% from a prior [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) breakout in June, putting it in profit-taking sell territory for buyers at that entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is rising, just below record highs after trending higher even as the stock market pulled back in August. The RS line, tracking a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is shown in blue in the chart below.



The current consolidation for EDU stock is entirely above the 10-week moving average, another bullish sign.


New Oriental has an unbeatable [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99. That means it is in the top 1% of all stocks, with an exceptionally attractive mixture of fundamental and technical strengths.


EDU stock is in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of share price performance over the past 12 months, as seen in an RS Rating of 97. But an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- suggests buying has been moderate in recent weeks.


Meanwhile, peer **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) edged up 0.1% to 35.87 Thursday as it consolidates with a potential 39.76 buy point.


TAL Education stock has a solid CR of 93 but an average RS Rating of 81.

New Oriental Earnings Growth
----------------------------


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-new-orientl-eduandtech-ads-edu.aspx) shows New Oriental Education averaged 20% earnings growth and 30% sales growth over the past three years. That's helped the China education stock to a strong EPS Rating of 90, out of a possible 99, and SMR Rating of A.


Analysts on average expect annual EPS to rise 32% to $3.41 in 2020 and 31% in 2021.


However, New Oriental earnings growth has cooled from 56% to 21% to 9% over the last three quarters.

Top China Stocks, School Stocks
-------------------------------


New Oriental Education is one of the top Chinese stocks to watch in today's stock market, along with **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) and **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)). The latter also belong to the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks.


New Oriental's 103% gain year to date outpaces a 34% gain for TAL Education stock and 21% gain for U.S. peer **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)).


Meanwhile, the Consumer Services-Education group to which they belong ranks No. 27 out of 197 industry groups. That's down from No. 10 four weeks ago.

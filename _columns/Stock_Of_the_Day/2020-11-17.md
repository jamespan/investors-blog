Tesla is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Tesla stock gapped higher on news that the electric-car maker will join the S&P 500 index next month, but pulled back from an early intraday high just shy of an official buy point.




Tuesday's move by Tesla stock follows a broader one for the electric-vehicle industry in general, especially among Chinese electric-car makers **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)), **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) and **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)). Tesla stock will join the S&P 500 after a five-quarter profitability streak. However, the company faces questions about its ability to hit ambitious production and delivery targets.


Tesla Stock
-----------



Tesla stock rose rose 8.2% to 441.61 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), gapping above its 50-day moving average but currently trading just below the midpoint of its daily range. Soon after the open, shares ran up to 462, above a 452.60 early entry and close to the official 466 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a handle in the base. TSLA stock fell as low as 433.01 intraday.


Investors should probably wait for Tesla to pass the intraday high of 462 to start a position, based on IBD's research. They could add more once the stock crosses the 466 buy point.


Tesla stock briefly traded above the 466 buy point overnight.


But the outside overnight moves and the early Tuesday morning action illustrate why IBD often cautions against buying in extended trade or right at the open.


Waiting five to 15 minutes after the open, once markets work out their initial excitement, can give investors a clearer view into the stock action. They might end up paying more. But they might also avoid quick losses on a stock that's initially up a lot.


Tesla stock has a best-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 76. It was also a [Stock Of The Day in late October](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tesla-stock-near-buy-point-tesla-earnings/?).


Tesla Stock To Join S&P 500
---------------------------


S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late Monday that Tesla stock would be added to the S&P 500 before the market open on Dec. 21. The move coincides with a quarterly rebalancing of the index. The company that Tesla will be replacing has yet to be named.


S&P Global said that due to "the large size of the addition, S&P Dow Jones Indices is seeking feedback through a consultation to the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once on the rebalance effective date or in two separate tranches ending on the rebalance effective date."


Stocks often get a short-term boost in the sunup to their addition to the benchmark index. But those short-term gains don't necessarily translate into long-term ones.


Tuesday's advance gave Tesla stock a market valuation of around $423 billion, according to MarketSmith. That made Tesla bigger than **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). It is also bigger than **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) combined.


Tesla Manufacturing Expansion
-----------------------------


Tesla's quarterly results have been boosted [by sales of emissions credits to other automakers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-is-it-a-buy-now/). It has tried to broaden its manufacturing capacity, with construction in progress at its third plant near Berlin, with work underway for a fourth factory outside Austin, Texas. The company has said it still expects to deliver 500,000 automobiles this year.


"Tesla remains a juggernaut in the electric-vehicle space that deserves credit for the vision and willingness to challenge the status quo in auto manufacturing," Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer recently said in a research note. "Many will question the scalability of this market, particularly with competition on the way."


The automaker's plans for better electric cars and batteries — and its ability to meet them — have made Tesla stock volatile. And it faces competition from U.S. and European automakers, who are also rolling out their own electric vehicles.


**Volkwagen** ([VWAGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)) in particular is expanding its electric-vehicle production and sales, with the crossover ID.4 set to launch by year-end or early 2021 in Europe, China and the U.S.


General Motors will launch a Hummer EV pickup in late 2021, likely before the Tesla Cybertruck. GM plans to roll out several new EV models in the next three years.


Tesla sales have fallen in Europe even as overall electric-car sales skyrocket due to tough emissions standards there. Tesla's China sales also have stalled since the summer, despite several price cuts there this year. With production capacity exceeding local demand, Tesla has started exporting made-in-China Model 3 sedans to Europe, partially replacing shipments from the Fremont, California, plant.


Competition To Tesla Stock
--------------------------


Tesla also faces competition from the likes of China-based electric-car maker Nio, which [reported better-than-expected results after the close on Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/news/nio-stock-nio-earnings-q3-2020-after-li-auto-xpeng-mixed/).


Wall Street will likely seek details on Nio's plans to launch an electric sedan next year, posing competition to Tesla's Model 3 sedans — Tesla's version of a mass-market offering.


Nio plans to expand into Europe next year. Nio's recently launched EC6 electric-coupe SUV has also reportedly built up a strong order backlog, and could bring more competition to Tesla's upcoming made-in-China Model Y.


However, short-seller Citron Research has said it was "[time for investors to rotate out of NIO](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-car-stocks-xpeng-motors-earnings-li-auto-earnings-hyliion-earnings-q3-2020/), enjoy your profits and look for the next disruptive technology."


Fellow China EV car makers **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) and **Xpeng Motors** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) [this month offered upbeat forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-car-stocks-xpeng-motors-earnings-li-auto-earnings-hyliion-earnings-q3-2020/), despite reporting mixed results.


Nio fell modestly in late trading following results after closing up 2.2%. Li Auto finished down 1.4%. Xpeng Motors sank 2.7%. All three stocks have shown explosive gains in recent weeks.

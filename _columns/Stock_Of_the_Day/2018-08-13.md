The stock has an [Accumulation/Distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) rating of A and a positive [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) of 1.1. Both gauges indicate that institutional investors are buying shares.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is lagging just below highs from early June. You would like to see this line at least trending higher, and hopefully breaking to new highs itself, before the stock attempts a breakout.


The stock's [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is an impressive 97. That means it has outperformed 97% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is a best-possible 99.


Targeting 5 Years Of Double-Digit Sales Growth
----------------------------------------------


Nanometrics makes process control metrology and inspection systems. Its systems are used in the fabrication of semiconductors and other solid-state devices, such as sensors, optoelectronic devices, light-emitting diodes, discretes and data-storage components.


Nanometrics said gains in the DRAM and Nand memory-chip markets fueled outsize results in the first and second quarters.


It reported second-quarter results on July 31. The company earned an adjusted 71 cents a share on sales of $88.6 million in the June quarter. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share jumped 137%, while sales climbed 38%.


"With our current visibility, we continue to forecast 2018 revenue growth of at least 20% year-over-year," Nanometrics Chief Executive Pierre-Yves Lesaicherre said [in a news release](http://investor.nanometrics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nanometrics-reports-second-quarter-2018-financial-results). "We remain confident that 2018 will be our fifth straight year of double-digit revenue growth, with expanding gross and operating margins, increased earnings per share, and significant free cash flow generation."

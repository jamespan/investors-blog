The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the housing industry remains a bright spot in the economy. ITB stock cleared a buy point Thursday




The exchange-traded fund includes home-improvement giants **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) as well as homebuilders **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)). The ETF also features construction materials companies such as **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) and **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)).


Housing stocks have rallied, despite a Covid-related slowdown in the overall economy, as homeowners take advantage of record-low borrowing rates to buy new homes or take on renovations. In fact, the pandemic may have spurred home buying, as people living in dense urban areas sought refuge in the suburbs, where social distancing could be more easily achieved.


Housing starts jumped 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 1.67 million units in last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. A Reuters survey of economists had forecast starts would rise to a rate of around 1.6 million units in December.


Building permits, a leading indicators of future housing starts, also topped forecasts, reaching an annualized pace of about 1.7 million.

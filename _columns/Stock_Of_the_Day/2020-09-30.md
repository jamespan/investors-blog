But investors may want to [size their position carefully](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/calculating-position-size-for-portfolio-management/) since SailPoint stock is rebounding off its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


SailPoint Stock: Cybersecurity Firm Targets Larger Customers
------------------------------------------------------------


As noted on [IBD Live on Tuesday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), the recent pullback was constructive after the stock rose for 12 weeks in a row from June through August.


SailPoint is finding success moving up-market by selling to larger companies, analysts say. When reporting June-quarter earnings, the cybersecurity firm referenced some of its largest deals ever.


In addition, enterprises have prioritized "Identity Governance," a part of the cybersecurity market, amid the shift to a more distributed workforce during the coronavirus pandemic.


The cybersecurity firm's June quarter adjusted profit popped nearly 1,000% to 15 cents as revenue surged 47% to $92.5 million.


In addition, SailPoint's subscription-based revenue rose 37% in the quarter. The company has been shifting to a cloud-based, software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model.


"The growing acceptance of SaaS-based identity governance is likely to accelerate displacements against legacy on-premise competitors, which still comprise the majority of current market spend," a recent Morgan Stanley report to clients said.


Investments In Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------------


SailPoint has increased investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve its "Predictive Identity" platform,Â  a recent RBC Capital note to clients said. Many software companies [aim to get a competitive edge](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) with AI tools.


In general, cybersecurity stocks seem well-positioned heading into third-quarter earnings, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note Wednesday.


"Based on our recent checks in the field we believe cybersecurity deal flow is holding up well/stronger than expected for Q3 in this environment as the remote access/work from home cloud theme is being prioritized by many IT decision makers as it serves a clear key need during this semi-lockdown," Ives said.


He added: "We have seen a number of larger cybersecurity deals in the field get accelerated during Q3 and green-lighted by C-level decision makers as more enterprises need to protect stepped up cloud deployments and security architecture in this unprecedented environment."

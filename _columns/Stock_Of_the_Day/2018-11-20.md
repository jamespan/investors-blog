**Innoviva** ([INVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the biotech stock flirts with a breakout amid new uses for its **GlaxoSmithKline** ([GSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK))-partnered respiratory medicines.




The biotech stock [formerly known as Theravance](http://investor.inva.com/news-releases/news-release-details/theravance-inc-announces-name-change-innoviva-inc) is intricately tied to Glaxo. Innoviva has a [series of royalty deals](https://www.inva.com/portfolio/) with Glaxo Group Limited, a subsidiary of the pharma giant. Glaxo sells Innoviva's suite of respiratory medicines in exchange for royalties on sales.


Innoviva's strategy appears to be working, according to a recent Wright Investor's Service report to clients. Innoviva describes itself as focused on "royalty management."


"During the year ended December 2017, sales at Innoviva were $217.22 million," according to the Wright note. "This is an increase of 62.6% vs. 2016 when the company's sales were $133.57 million. This was the fourth straight year of sales growth at Innoviva."

Respiratory Medicines With Glaxo
--------------------------------


In 2014, [Theravance separated](http://investor.inva.com/news-releases/news-release-details/theravance-inc-and-theravance-biopharma-inc-announce-completion) into two publicly traded companies. They're known as Theravance and **Theravance Biopharma** ([TBPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBPH)). Theravance aimed to maximize "the potential value of the respiratory assets partnered with GlaxoSmithKline." In 2016, it became Innoviva.


Innoviva's respiratory medicines include Relvar/Breo Ellipta, a once-daily inhaler used to treat asthma and [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679), or COPD. COPD is a chronic lung disease that causes restricted airflow from the lungs.


Under the terms of the Glaxo deal, Innoviva receives a 15% royalty on the first $3 billion of annual global sales for the inhaler. After that, the royalty ticks down to 5%. [In the third quarter](http://investor.inva.com/news-releases/news-release-details/innoviva-reports-third-quarter-2018-financial-results), that royalty generated $51.7 million in revenue for Innoviva.


Another deal resulted in $9.8 million in revenue during the third quarter. Glaxo also sells an asthma/COPD inhaler called Anoro Ellipta for Innoviva. Innoviva gets its royalties under a tiering system for 6.5%-10% of annual global net sales.


Glaxo also paid Innoviva $3.6 million in third-quarter royalties from a COPD inhaler known as Trelegy Ellipta. That deal pays Innoviva a 15% royalty on sales.


Another Use For Inhaler
-----------------------


On Nov. 9, European officials approved a [new use for Trelegy Ellipta](http://investor.inva.com/news-releases/news-release-details/once-daily-trelegy-ellipta-gains-expanded-copd-indication-europe). It's now the first single inhaler specifically used in COPD patients whose symptoms aren't adequately treated with dual bronchodilation or other methods.


Bronchodilation is the "foundation of COPD therapy," Innoviva and Glaxo said in a release. In this treatment, physicians aim to open the bronchi — a passage for air into the lungs — to increase airflow into the lungs. But bronchodilation doesn't always work, the companies say.


Trelegy Ellipta is a combination of three molecules in a single inhaler.


"The expanded indication for Trelegy Ellipta reflects the evidence supporting its potential benefits in a broader group of patients than originally indicated, giving them the option of taking a once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the first time," Innoviva and Glaxo said.


In the U.S., Trelegy Ellipta is a maintenance treatment for COPD and can reduce exacerbations in some COPD patients.


Innoviva Stock Ratings
----------------------


Innoviva stock has high ratings, per Investor's Business Daily standards.

It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 93, meaning it performs in the top 7% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

Innoviva [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) is also approaching a potential [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 16.94 out of a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

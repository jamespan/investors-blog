[IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) soared on its second-quarter earnings beat, once again squeezing short investors who made a bet against the owner of popular mobile dating app Tinder.




Match stock surged 24.2% to close at 91.77 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?), vaulting past a [technical entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 75.38. Amid the ongoing market correction, the next test for Match stock will be holding most of its gains.


While Wednesday's surge was bullish, it is risky to buy stocks while the market is in a correction. One investing option is to wait for shares to consolidate, and to set up a possible buy area when market conditions improve.


Match stock also jumped May 8 when it reported better-than-expected earnings and Tinder growth rebounded. Match stock then formed a flat base, a positive sign.

Before Match reported earnings, its Relative Strength Rating stood at 97 out of a best-possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That means it has outperformed 97% of all other stocks. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.


Match Stock: Short Squeeze
--------------------------


Typically, the strongest stocks' [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) are either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground. The RS line is in blue in all IBD stock charts.


Match's RS line had been holding steady near new highs for the last several weeks.


Match said second-quarter adjusted earnings were 43 cents, falling from a year earlier but topping estimates amid investments. Revenue climbed 18% to $498 million.


Analysts expected Match earnings of 40 cents on sales of $489 million for the period ended June 30.


"Like in the previous quarter, the positive reaction to the results was amplified by the roughly 36% short interest (as a percentage of float) in the stock," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali said in a report to clients. "We note that InterActiveCorp continues to own 80% of Match Group, limiting the float, and that a part of the short interest is from investors wanting to play the stub of IAC."


IAC Owns 80% Of Match Stock
---------------------------


Media mogul Barry Diller spun off Match Group from his **IAC** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)) company in 2015. IAC consolidates its online dating firms' financial results.


While reporting second-quarter results late Wednesday, IAC said it will explore the possibility of spinning off its majority stakes in Match and **ANGI Homeservices** ([ANGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANGI)). Match stock fell a fraction in after-hours trading following the announcement.


Match stock trades mainly on Tinder paid subscriber growth, with analysts expecting a boost from expansion in Asia.


The company garners nearly half its revenue from the Tinder app, though it's still available for free. Match's revenue growth comes from premium versions that provide extra dating features.


When reporting second-quarter earnings Aug. 6, Match said it added 503,000 Tinder dating app subscribers in the second quarter, topping estimates of 390,000, as international growth shined. Overseas markets such as India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are key for Tinder, analysts say.


Match Stock: Asia-Pacific Key
-----------------------------


"Asia-Pacific is a focus area, representing an addressable market of 300 million singles and growing smartphone adoption," Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in his note to clients. "Match is planting the seeds now to take advantage of improving cultural stigmas."


Dallas-based Match continues to add features to the Tinder app, most recently allowing users to post video snippets.


Match in April hired Ravi Mehta as its new chief product officer. Mehta had served as Facebook's product director for youth engagement. At Facebook, he helped develop Lasso, a competitor to the popular TikTok short video sharing app.


As Match targets international markets, some analysts expect lower average revenue per subscriber because premium versions of Tinder could be priced lower.

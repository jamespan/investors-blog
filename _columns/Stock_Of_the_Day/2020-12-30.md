**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the payment facilitator stands to benefit from new fiscal stimulus in the near term and a vaccine-enabled recovery through 2021. Visa stock broke above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) to hit an all-time high in Wednesday's [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).




Meanwhile, Visa rival **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which is part of IBD's [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) portfolio, also cleared an early entry point.


The two payment network stocks lag well behind digital payments leaders [**PayPal**](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and [**Square**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/) ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) in the IBD [Finance-CreditCard/PaymentProcessing](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-visa-inc-cl-a-v.aspx) industry group.


Yet Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti dubbed Visa stock and Mastercard "stealthy Covid recovery plays" last month, and the latest stock action supports his thesis.

Here's the logic: PayPal and Square both saw sales accelerate as the coronavirus pandemic sparked a surge in business moving online. Yet the launch of vaccines should spur a rotation from pure-play e-commerce payment stocks, Fandetti wrote.


What makes Mastercard and Visa stock somewhat "stealthy" recovery plays is that they also benefit from the pandemic shift away from cash. Yet that long-term trend was swamped by 2020's short-term economic crash and the persistent hit to international travel. As those negatives unwind through 2021, the positive post-Covid outlook for Visa and Mastercard should shine through.


Visa Stock Chart Analysis
-------------------------


Visa stock on Wednesday rose 1.9% to 218.36, clearing a 217.75 buy point from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). That flat base could be seen as a handle to a consolidation going back to early September. Visa stock hit 220.39 intraday.


Visa stock has rallied about 5% this week, likely sparked by President Donald Trump's Sunday decision to sign the $900 billion stimulus and $1.4 trillion government spending bill.


Wednesday's advance carried Visa stock past its prior high of 217.65 on Nov. 9. Visa stock jumped 7.2% that day as Pfizer announced its vaccine was 90% effective, a strong sign that the global economy would normalize in 2021.


Visa stock also perked above a [down-sloping trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) on Dec 24, offering an early entry point.


Meanwhile, Mastercard rose 2.6% to 355.55, clearing a 348.09 early entry point, while also breaking above a trend line. MA stock has an official buy point of 367.35. However, 357.10 is another early entry that could be viewed as handle.


Visa Stock Lagging
------------------


Despite hitting a record high Wednesday, Visa stock has been a laggard during the pandemic. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, was near a 19-month low before this week's rally. Mastercard stock has shown similar mildly lagging action in 2020.


Visa stock has a mediocre 63 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/#:~:text=The%20Composite%20Rating%2C%20which%20ranges,the%20other%20IBD%20SmartSelect%20Ratings%3A&text=RS%20Rating%3A%20Gauges%20a%20stock's,)%20to%2099%20(best).), with 99 the top rating. The Composite Rating combines several key fundamental and technical factors into a single score. IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.


Yet fundamentals are set to improve as the pandemic wanes. Visa earnings per share fell 7% to $5.04 in this fiscal year ended September, with 23% declines in fiscal Q3 and Q4. But analysts see EPS growing 8% to a record $5.44 in fiscal 2021 and 24% to $6.75 in 2022, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Visa Growth Opportunities
-------------------------


At a Dec. 2 Credit Suisse technology investor presentation, Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu touted "massive opportunities" for growth. He highlighted digital wallets for the unbanked in emerging markets, person-to-person payments via Visa Direct, and business-to-business payments.


"Our payment volume across the network is about $8 trillion to date," Prabhu said. "There's $18 trillion in cash still left that has even gone up in the last four years even though we've digitized a lot of cash. So that gives you a sense of how much more is left. And out of that $18 trillion, $8 trillion, or almost as much as what we have today globally, is in the developed markets."

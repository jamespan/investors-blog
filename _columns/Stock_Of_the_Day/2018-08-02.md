CF Stock Composite Rating
-------------------------


While today's Stock of the Day currently boasts strong technical action, a spotty track record for earnings and sales growth is weighing down on [CF's Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-c-f-industries-holdings-cf.aspx), which is a 60 out of 99.


Top stocks typically have high Composite Ratings as they launch big price moves. This rating measures stocks on a variety of factors, including earnings and sales growth, margins, ROE and price performance.


CF Industries Earnings
----------------------


But a strong quarterly report late Wednesday is the catalyst for the fertilizer maker's gains in the stock market today. That signals a turnaround is in the works.


[CF Industries earnings](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180801005985/en/) surged 530% in the June quarter to 63 cents a share while revenue jumped 16% to $1.3 billion. Both metrics handily beat analyst estimates.


Management attributed the strong performance in part to lower North American natural gas costs and higher global nitrogen gas prices.


"Technology is improving rapidly and increasing the ability to extract natural gas at ever lower costs," CF Industries President and CEO Tony Will said on the quarterly conference call Wednesday.


"As a result, we expect to remain at the low end of the global cost curve. Along with the favorable North American natural gas environment, we are seeing more balance in the global supply and demand for nitrogen driven by reduced production in high cost regions, notably Eastern Europe and China. This is supporting global urea prices well above the lows of 2017."


Industry Group Analysis
-----------------------


Meanwhile, industry group peer **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)) broke out over a seven-month-long consolidation Thursday after a bullish quarterly report of its own. Nutrien has a weak Composite Rating of 53 out of 99.


And **Mosaic Company** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)), which has a Composite Rating of 80, rallied 1.9% to 30.09, just above a 30.05 buy point from a flat base. Mosaic earnings are due next week.


As a whole, the Chemicals-Agricultural group ranks No. 125 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks. Top stocks typically come from the top quartile of the group rankings.

**Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the IBD 50 member looks to build a follow-on buy point after powering into profit-taking zone. Trex earnings growth has accelerated, fueling the stock.




The firm is the world's largest manufacturer of wood-alternative decking and railing. It also makes a slew of other outdoor items using recycled materials.


Shares rose 2.4% to 79.27 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). After 12 sessions of tight trading, Trex stock is close to finishing a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) pattern with a 80.29 buy point, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The three-weeks-tight is an opportunity for existing holders to add a few more shares. With a three-weeks-tight, investors should try to buy as close to entry point as possible.


Trex stock exploded out of buy range and landed in profit-taking zone a day after posting blowout earnings late on Aug. 30. Trex earnings shot up 49%, a second quarter of accelerating growth, while sales were up 31%. This first true test of the 10-week line offered Trex holders an opportunity to add shares after Trex stock previously muscled past a 60.30 [saucer buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is holding at record highs.

In the second quarter, analysts call for Elanco to report triple-digit sales and earnings growth as it digests the acquisition of **Bayer**'s ([BAYRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAYRY)) animal health business.


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), ELAN stock popped 3.8% to 35.53.

Further, people spent more time with their pets and noticed more health issues with them during the pandemic.

ELAN Stock Gets A Boost From Pandemic
-------------------------------------


The Covid pandemic highlighted "the importance of animals to society â€” pet and protein," Elanco Chief Executive Jeffrey Simmons told Investor's Business Daily in a recent interview.


"We were isolated at home, and pet adoptions started to grow. People want to have companionship and they saw the importance of pets to families," Simmons said. "There's no question, we're seeing pet ownership go up and adoptions increase."


As a result, pet health companies like Elanco, **Zoetis** ([ZTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTS)) and **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) are gaining traction. On a year-to-date basis, ELAN stock has climbed more than 15% as of midday Tuesday. Shares also rose above their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), signaling a potential buy area.


Investors could also look for ELAN stock to cross a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 36.63 out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Strong Growth Expected
----------------------


In the first quarter, the pet segment drove more than half Elanco's sales. Excluding the benefit of the Bayer animal health acquisition, Elanco reported 34% growth for its pet health unit. The livestock business grew by a third, though legacy sales fell 7% on an unfavorable comparison.


Next, ELAN stock analysts call for adjusted profit to grow 200% in the second quarter to 27 cents per share. Sales are also expected to pop roughly 112% to $1.24 billion. Both metrics will benefit from the addition of the Bayer animal health business, which closed last August.



Strong growth could undoubtedly help ELAN stock's ratings. According to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital), shares rank in the top 23% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical measures, noted by the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) of 77. Leading stocks tend to have CRs of at least 95.


ELAN stock also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 73, which puts its 12-month performance in the top 27% of all stocks. But the cream of the crop have RS Ratings of at least 80.


Protein Consumption Rises
-------------------------


Elanco CEO Simmons expects bullish trends to continue for animal-health companies. In addition to growing pet ownership, animal protein consumption is on the rise, he said.


"As anyone makes more money, moving from plants to an animal-based diet is happening," he said. "People are moving away from carbs and sugar to chicken, fish and lean beef. The world ate more red meat in 2019 than at any time in history."


Elanco's job, he said, is to "give animals what they need and consumers what they want."

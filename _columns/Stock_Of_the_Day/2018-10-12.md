Consumer electronics giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as its shares held tough during the recent stock market sell-off. Apple stock has found support at the critical 50-day moving average line.




Apple stock fell below that key technical support level on Wednesday and Thursday, but returned to the average on Friday.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Apple rose 3.6% to 222.11, comfortably above its 50-day line. It hit a record high of 233.47 on Oct. 3.


Lately Apple has benefited from upbeat sales reports about its new flagship smartphones. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company released its 12th-generation iPhones on Sept. 21. They include the 5.8-inch OLED-screen iPhone XS and the 6.5-inch OLED-screen iPhone XS Max.

Apple iPhone XR Preorders Start Next Week
-----------------------------------------


Next Friday, Apple will begin taking preorders for a new midrange handset called the iPhone XR. That handset features a 6.1-inch LCD screen and comes in a range of colorful cases. It will be available in stores on Oct. 26.


Higher prices for the new iPhones should boost Apple's revenue and profit in the important segment, analysts say.Â The iPhone XS starts at $999, while the XS Max starts at $1,099. The iPhone XR starts at $749.


Foxconn Report Good News For Apple
----------------------------------


On Thursday, Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn, aka Hon Hai, reported the second best monthly revenue in its history in September. The results buoy hopes for solid sales at Apple, since Foxconn produces iPhones and other products for the tech giant, [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honhai-results/foxconns-sept-revenue-jumps-buoys-hopes-for-solid-sales-at-apple-idUSKCN1ML1AC). Foxconn is Apple's largest manufacturing partner.


Foxconn performed better than its seasonal average in the September quarter, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White said in a report Thursday. However, rival contract manufacturer Pegatron, another Apple supplier, performed worse than its seasonal average last quarter, White said.


Pegatron's weak September is likely due to the fact that it is producing the majority of the iPhone XR handsets, which will hit the market five weeks after the iPhone XS series, White said. Foxconn is expected to produce all of the iPhone XS units, the vast majority of the XS Max units and a relatively small percentage of the XR, he said.


In addition to the new iPhones, Apple is hoping for a strong holiday selling season for a range of accessories. They include the Apple Watch Series 4, HomePod smart speakers and AirPods earbuds.


Apple is scheduled to report September-quarter results and give December-quarter guidance on Nov. 1.

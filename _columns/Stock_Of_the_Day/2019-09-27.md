Aerospace parts maker **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). TransDigm stock doesn't have a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but is several weeks into a consolidation after soaring out of buy range.




Defense contractors have risen in recent months despite a choppy [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) as tensions rise with Iran and China. Among other defense stocks, **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)) is in a buy range while **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) has pulled back from a breakout. **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) and **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) are among others faring well.


TransDigm Stock
---------------


In August, TransDigm stock had fallen out of buy range after breaking out of a second-stage [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 478.96 entry point. But then shares gapped above the 5% chase zone from that buy point following [strong fiscal third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/transdigm-earnings-crush-estimates-special-dividend-transdigm-stock/).


Now TransDigm stock has been consolidating for several weeks above buy range and is headed toward profit-taking range. Shares have moved sideways since Aug. 19 but didn't hit their all-time high of 542.10 until Sept. 5. TransDigm stock would need another full week to form a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) on a weekly chart.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been holding near record highs for several months. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. It's the blue line in the chart below.


Shares fell 2.35% to 518.19 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).



TransDigm Fundamentals
----------------------


TransDigm stock has a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measures accelerating profitability, is also a 95, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-transdigm-group-inc-tdg.htm) tool. The stock is featured on the [IBD Leaderboard.](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)


TransDigm earnings rose 23% in fiscal Q3 to $4.95 per share adjusted, the company reported in August. Sales jumped 69% to $1.66 billion, fueled by a big acquisition. Both beat analyst expectations. After the earnings beat, TransDigm raised its full-year EPS and declared a special cash dividend of $30 per share.


TransDigm is based in Cleveland and makes actuators, control systems and other aerospace components for the defense industry. In March, TransDigm completed its $3.6 billion acquisition of Esterline Technologies, which supplies parts for the Lockheed F-35 joint strike fighter as well as the commercial sector.

TransDigm's Trouble On The Hill
-------------------------------


But it's not all clear skies for TransDigm. The company has been accused of price gouging by the Pentagon. A February Defense Department inspector general report found that the company was earning "excess profits" from the department. The report looked at 47 parts and found that TransDigm's profit margins were 1,000% or more for 17 of them.


Last year, the Defense Logistics Agency paid $4,361 for a [drive pin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/pentagon-contractor-s-9-400-profit-on-half-inch-pin-challenged) that should cost $46, Bloomberg reported.


The House Oversight and Reform Committee asked for a refund of the $16.1 million that TransDigm overcharged in defense contracts. The company pushed back on the decision before agreeing to repay in May.


Other Defense Stocks
--------------------


The Aerospace/Defense group is rated No. 8 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.


Raytheon stock sank 1.2% to 195.52, comfortably in the buy zone above a 193.47 entry from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base. Raytheon has a deal to merge with Dow Jones member **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)), whose stock is close to its own handle buy point.



Northrop Grumman stock fell 2.9% to 371.18, back below a 377.44 flat-base entry cleared Thursday.


Lockheed Martin stock fell 1.3% and is still near record highs.


L3Harris stock dipped 2% to 208.92, nearing 50-day/10-week line support and just in range from a flat base with a 200.87 entry. The 5% chase zone ends at 210.91. L3 Harris stock also is starting a new consolidation.

**Ionis Pharmaceuticals** ([IONS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IONS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares form a short stroke pattern after the biotech obliterated fourth-quarter earnings estimates.




A [short stroke](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) is a rare pattern that forms over two weeks. In the first week, a stock rises 10%-20%, or more. In the second week, shares trade tightly. Ionis stock flew 15.1% on Feb. 27, the day of its quarterly report. Since then, shares have risen a small fraction. It's now facing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 72.83.


Shares also are getting higher Investor's Business Daily ratings. Ionis stock now has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. [That improved from](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-ionis-pharmaceuticals-sees-relative-strength-rating-rise-to-93/) an RS Rating of 93 in November. The RS Rating pits a stock's 12-month performance against all other stocks. Ionis stock is in the top 3%.


Ionis stock also has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 94, putting shares in the top 6% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Shares also appeared Friday on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), and Ionis stock is ranked eighth out of more than 500 [biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/). On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Ionis [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) advanced 0.9%, to 70.46.

Ionis Stock Flies On Earnings Report
------------------------------------


During the fourth quarter, diluted Ionis earnings of $2.21 per share crushed expectations for a 36-cent loss, Leerink analyst Mani Foroohar said in a report to clients. Ionis earnings turned over from a 3-cent loss in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, Ionis earnings were 40 cents a share.


"The beat in (earnings) was due to the recognition of a one-time noncash benefit of $291 million," he said. "The benefit is one-time and suggests management has confidence in continued profitability, though the large benefit reported (Feb. 27) will be a one-time event."



Commercial revenue of $73 million spiked more than 35%. Revenue from research and collaboration deals was $119 million, growing more than 4% vs. last year. That was "significantly higher than our expectation of $61.6 million," he said. This was due to a $35 million milestone payment.


[Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stock-biotech-earnings-q4-2018/) developed with partner **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), generated $70 million, slightly lower than Foroohar's estimate for $73.7 million. But [Tegsedi, an amyloidosis treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-amyloidosis-drug-tafamidis-alnylam-ionis-drugs/) developed with **Akcea Therapeutics** ([AKCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKCA)), brought in $2.2 million, topping his estimate for $1 million.


Ionis Has Plans In Huntington's Disease
---------------------------------------


Looking ahead, Ionis expects **Roche** ([RHHBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHHBY)) to file for approval of the companies' jointly produced Huntington's disease treatment within the next 12 months. Foroohar called pending data from a study of that drug "a major catalyst for 2019." That study could serve as the basis for seeking approval, he said.


Ionis also is in regulatory discussions with officials in the U.S. and Europe over Waylivra, an Akcea-partnered drug. Waylivra would treat a rare disease called [familial chylomicronemia syndrome](http://fcs.raredr.com/). In this, patients experience abdominal pain and potentially fatal bouts of pancreatitis.


The biotech is also studying Waylivra in a Phase 3 test of patients with [familial partial lipodystrophy](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/familial-partial-lipodystrophy/), a rare disease characterized by progressive loss of fat from various areas of the body. Patients can also experience the buildup of fat under the skin in other areas of the body.

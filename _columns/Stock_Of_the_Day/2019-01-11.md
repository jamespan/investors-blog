**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the leading biotech stock broke out in higher-than-average [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/).




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Vertex [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) it began forming in October with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 187.86. Shares rose 1.1% to close at 188.16. Vertex stock is ranked fourth out of more than 500 [biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) tracked by Investor's Business Daily.


Vertex is the biotech leader in cystic fibrosis treatments. Rather than target the symptoms of the devastating lung disease, Vertex aims to treat the [underlying genetic abnormalities](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/vertex-plans-to-eradicate-cystic-fibrosis-and-go-from-there/) that lead to it. It has three approved treatments and is [exploring a dozen others](https://www.vrtx.com/pipeline-medicines/investigational-medicines-pipeline).


Notable among its efforts, Vertex is investigating the use of several triple-pill regimens to treat cystic fibrosis. The biotech stock [believes a triple regimen](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qa-vertex-chief-talks-about-companys-transformational-year/) could treat up to 90% of its patients. The remaining 10% will need a [gene-editing solution](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-gene-editing-biotech-companies/), Vertex says.

The most recent news for a triple pill was in November. Then, Vertex said a combination of tezacaftor, ivacaftor and VX-659 helped patients breathe easier in a late-stage test. The firm still has another [triple pill in late-stage testing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vertex-stock-triple-pill-cystic-fibrosis-treatment/).


Getting FDA Approval
--------------------


Analysts say Vertex could ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve more than one triple regimen. Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff called for Vertex's triple pill to hit the market by 2020 in a November report.


That could boost already massive sales. In 2017, Vertex had $2.49 billion in total revenue. Of that, cystic fibrosis treatments generated about $2.17 billion in sales. Royalty revenue accounted for the remainder of the revenue.


For the upcoming fourth quarter, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for Vertex to report adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share on $821 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted profit would decline 47%. But revenue would rise nearly 32%.


RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams calls for Vertex to beat expectations. He notes prescriptions of Vertex's medicines have climbed 8% sequentially.


Promising Drugs
---------------


Cystic fibrosis treatment Symdeko appears to have grabbed a greater-than-expected share of the market. Symdeko is a regimen of tezacaftor and ivacaftor — the latter of which sells as Kalydeco.


RBC's Abrahams says Symdeko has cannibalized sales of another Vertex drug, Orkambi. That's partially offset by strong sales of Orkambi for newly diagnosed patients ages 2-5.


"This should catalyze a meaningful bottom-line beat," he said.


Guidance for 2019 will be more tricky, he said. Vertex will exclude from its outlook areas in which its medicines don't receive insurance reimbursement. He also assumes about $100 million in triple regimen sales for the year and from Symdeko outside the U.S.



Abrahams expects the narrative for Vertex in 2019 "to shift toward strategies to diversify around cystic fibrosis longer term."


Licenses Of Vertex Treatments
-----------------------------


In that vein, Vertex also has a Phase 2 drug in testing for pain treatment. Further, the biotech stock is investigating blood diseases and a genetic disorder that can lead to lung or liver disease.


Also, Germany's Merck KGaA has licensed Vertex's oncology portfolio, and **Johnson & Johnson**'s ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) Janssen unit has licensed an influenza drug from Vertex.


The biotech stock is also a key partner with **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)) on its gene-editing [therapy for sickle cell disease](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-vertex-gene-editing-fast-track/). Earlier this month, Vertex stock rose nearly 6% in a day after the FDA granted the gene-editing drug a fast track designation, allowing for speedier review.


Both Vertex stock and the broader group of biotech stocks have climbed by double digits so far in 2019. Last year, Vertex stock held up amid a broader downturn and ended 2018 with a gain of nearly 11%. Broadly, biotech stocks lost more than 14%.


Vertex stock has an IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. This means the biotech stock trades in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 90, a measure of a stock's performance over the past 12 months.

**Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the buildout of 5G wireless networks accelerates globally. The maker of test and measurement systems for the communications and electronics industries moved into a buy zone on Monday.




While Keysight stock dipped 0.5 to close at 102.50 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?), it remains in a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's just one [5G stock to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/).


Telecom companies are in the very early stages of deploying 5G wireless services. Keysight's customers — including semiconductor firms and network gear makers — use its test and measurement gear in research and development as well as ramping up manufacturing of commercial products.


From a technical view, Keysight has formed a [second-stage flat base,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) best seen on a weekly chart, on top of another flat base that ran from July to August. In the process, it created a buy point at 102.10. One concern for investors could be that Keysight stock has been on a long run for three years and could run out of steam.

Keysight stock has gained some 67% from a year ago on upbeat views for its 5G-related business. One question is whether expected revenue growth is built into the stock valuation.


5G Wireless Upgrade Cycle In Early Stages
-----------------------------------------


Barclays analyst Tim Long recently met with Keysight management to discuss the 5G market.


"Using the 4G upgrade cycle as a proxy, management believes the company's 5G business will grow through 2022," Long said in a recent note to clients. "We believe the first-mover advantage, much higher ASPs (average selling prices), and more diversified offerings will prove this thesis correct."


**Agilent Technologies** ([A](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=A)) spun off Santa Rosa, Calif.-based Keysight in November 2014. The next year, Keysight acquired U.K.-based Anite, a supplier of wireless test solutions. In 2017, Keysight acquired Ixia for $1.6 billion.


"Keysight continues to be underappreciated in its core communications business — with leverage to a multiyear 5G cycle with solid positioning across the entire 5G workflow from electronic design automation, validation/verification, all the way thru the end of the life-cycle via Ixia," Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said in his August report to clients.


5G Wireless Networks: Fourth Industrial Revolution
--------------------------------------------------


In the 5G network test equipment market, Keysight competes against **Viavi Solutions** ([VIAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIAV)), Japan's Anritsu and Germany's Rohde & Schwartz.


In addition, Keysight's 5G customers include **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and China's Lenovo. Wireless service providers that buy Keysight's test gear span the U.S., Europe, China and South Korea.


5G wireless networks will whisk video at faster speeds to smartphones and mobile devices. Some wireless firms, such as **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), aim to provide 5G broadband services to homes.


Furthermore, pundits also expect 5G networks to have a role in manufacturing automation, cloud gaming, autonomous vehicles, drones and remote health care services.


Keysight is a member of IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group, which ranks [No. 48 out of 197 groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-21-2019/).


Keysight Stock: Solid Technical Ratings

According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx), Keysight has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/) of 96 out of a possible 99, meaning it has outperformed 96% of stocks over the past 12 months. Relative strength compares a stock's price performance to that of the S&P 500.


Meanwhile, Keysight also has a Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. The Composite Rating, part of the [IBD investment system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), looks at key technical and fundamental factors such as earnings and sales growth.


In addition, Keysight stock has an [accumulation/distribution rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of B. The rating runs from a best-possible A to a worst-possible E.


It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A rising Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a sign that institutional buyers are buying.


Aside from communications, Keysight also competes in the automotive and aerospace & defense markets.

Freshpet stock is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the pet food maker clears a key resistance point, thanks to increased spending on pets over the past several months.




**Freshpet** ([FRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRPT)) benefits from a boost in spending on pets, as folks seek to quell their pandemic anxiety by doting on their furry companions. The American Pet Products Association says 64% of pet owners surveyed have spent the same amount of money on their pets as they did pre-pandemic — and 21% have spent either a little or a lot more.


On Monday, Freshpet posted revenue of $84.2 million for the third quarter, up 29% from a year ago and edging past Zacks estimates by 0.2%. EPS rose 12.5% to 9 cents, matching views.


"Despite capacity limitations and the Covid pandemic, Freshpet continued to deliver incredibly strong and consistent growth on the top line and even stronger growth on the bottom line in the third quarter," Freshpet CEO Billy Cyr said in a news release Monday.

But investors should be very cautious about buying stocks in a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-stock-market-sell-off-election-day-apple-tesla-rival-nio-deliveries/). A market in correction means investors should avoid new purchases.


Also, given that it's Election Day, and official results may not be available for several days, investors should factor in they don't know how the market will react.

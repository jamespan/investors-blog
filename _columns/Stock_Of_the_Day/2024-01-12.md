**Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the financial technology company wins price target hikes for FOUR stock.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), FOUR stock slipped a fraction to close at 74.72. Shift4 stock has gained about 2% in 2024. FOUR stock has climbed 25% over the past 52 weeks.


Allentown, Pa.-based digital payments processor Shift4 gets most of its revenue from customers in the hotel and restaurant industries as well as casinos. The company has expanded into sports stadiums, airlines and charities, as well as food and beverage companies.


FOUR stock holds an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 76.51 from a long consolidation.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/), while not at all-time highs, is at a multi-month high.


FOUR Stock: Finaro Deal Closes
------------------------------


The relative strength line has been improving since Shift4 on Oct. 26 closed the $575 million acquisition of Finaro. It's a Pan-European e-commerce platform with banking licenses in Europe, Japan and Hong Kong.


Truist Securities on Friday hiked its price target on Shift4, calling the company a market share gainer.


Further, Truist analyst Andrew Jefferies raised his price target to 100 from 75. He also cited "strong preliminary 2024 guidance."


"We expect Shift4 will deliver mid-40% organic end-to-end transaction volume growth and low-20% organic revenue growth in 2024," he said in a report.


"When we think about 2024 and 2025, we are excited about the company's Venues business, which we see as responsible for powering significantly faster-than-expected organic volume growth," Jefferies added. "Although these large stadium and ticketing customers blend down yield, they are critical to gross profit and EBITDA growth. We are also constructive on Finaro, the recently acquired cross-border payments company.


Global Payments Shot Down Acquisition Talk
------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs on Thursday hiked its price target on Shift4 stock to 90 from 76.


**Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) in December shot down reports that it is mulling an acquisition of Shift4.


Chief Executive Jared Isaacman controls more than 80% of Shift4's voting power and 35% of the company.


Shift4 went public in June 2020. Some analysts have speculated about Isaacman taking the company private.


Also, Shift4 recently purchased sports stadium payment processor Appetize for $100 million.


At the end of 2022, Shift4 launched its next-generation Sky Tab restaurant payment system. Sky Tab competes with **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)), **Block**'s ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) Square business and **Fiserv**'s ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)) Clover.


In addition, FOUR stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 94, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).

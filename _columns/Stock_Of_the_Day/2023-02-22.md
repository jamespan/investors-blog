Supply Chain Complexity Increasing
----------------------------------


SPS Commerce provides internet cloud-based software that connects retail trading partners. It offers services to optimize supply chain operations for companies in retail, grocery, distribution, supply and logistics.


"The ongoing transition to omnichannel in retail and increasing complexity in supply chain management continue to fuel the need for automation," SPS Commerce Chief Executive Archie Black said on a conference call with analysts.


For the current quarter, SPS Commerce predicts adjusted earnings of 57 cents a share on sales of $123.8 million, based on the midpoint of its outlook. Further, that would translate to year-over-year growth of 4% in earnings and 18% in sales.


For full-year 2023, SPS Commerce sees adjusted earnings of $2.66 a share on sales of $524.5 million. Also, that would translate to year-over-year growth of 13% in earnings and 16% in sales.


SPSC Stock On Tech Leaders List
-------------------------------


"We continue to be impressed with the company's consistent execution and playbook to keep delivering shareholder value over the long-term," Needham analyst Scott Berg said in a recent note to clients. "As one of the most recession-resilient companies in our SaaS (software-as-a-service) universe, SPS is seeing little-to-zero macro impact."


Berg rates SPSC stock as buy with a price target of 160.


William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau said SPS Commerce is well positioned to meet or exceed its 2023 targets. Also, he has a market perform rating on SPSC stock.


"The supply chain software segment seems to be more insulated from macro pressure vs. other areas of technology," Pfau said in a note. "Further, supply chain digitization tailwinds should continue for several years, benefiting SPS Commerce's growth."


SPSC stock is tied for first place with **Ceridian** ([CDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDAY)) in IBD's specialty enterprise software industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-sps-commerce-spsc.aspx).

"We expect SolarEdge to benefit in 2020 and 2021 from a growing product roadmap and expanded supply chain outside of China," Ricchiuti wrote in a note to clients.


"We believe SolarEdge can continue to demonstrate strong growth in revenue and earnings per share and that there is room for further share price appreciation over the next twelve months," Ricchiuti wrote. SolarEdge is fueled by "top-line momentum and improving margins in the core solar products business and new growth opportunities in adjacent markets," he said.

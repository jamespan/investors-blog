**Copart Stock**
----------------


Shares rose 3% to 148.94 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). CPRT stock is flashing an early entry as it rebounds from its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), breaks a trend line and moves above short-term resistance. CPRT stock briefly cleared an official [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 149.16 from a flat base, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) extends to 156.62.


Copart was added to [Swing Trader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Wednesday morning, while CPRT stock also is a [Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). Buying near the 50-day line is often a good place to start a position in a Long-Term Leader.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending upward, near recent highs. Its [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 84 out of a possible 99. Copart's [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 97, having posted five straight quarters of earnings growth.


With a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, Copart stock ranks first in IBD's Retail/Wholesale Auto Parts industry group.


The group has gained 30% so far this year, as prices for used cars and replacement parts have surged amid stalled production of new cars due to supply-chain issues.


Auto parts retailer **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) edged up 2.1% and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) gained 1.7%. Both are working on flat bases as well. AZO stock is still below its 50-day line while ORLY stock is trying to reclaim that level.


**Copart Earnings**
-------------------


The Dallas-based company reported fourth-quarter earnings that surged 49% year over year to $1.03 a share. Sales jumped 42% to $749 million, the second straight quarter of accelerating top-line growth. For fiscal 2021, Copart earnings swelled 44% to $3.70, and revenue grew 22% to $2.69 billion.


Copart CEO Jeffrey Liaw said in an earnings call with investors on Sept. 9 that strong used car prices are driving returns. 


The company reported the average selling price for its used vehicles worldwide grew 20.7% for the quarter, with U.S. ASPs up 20.6%.


Part of the uptick is driven by a growing mix of luxury cars on its lots.


"I think if you visited some of our yards, you'd be astonished by some of the high-value Range Rovers and European vehicles that you would see on lots," Liaw said.


Outlook
-------


Liaw is optimistic that global driving trends will continue to fuel growth.


"We continue to believe that, longer term, mobility will continue to grow the miles per person in the U.S.," he said. "Certainly in our emerging markets, in many of the countries that are buying our highest value vehicles, (miles per person) will grow significantly."


Copart is also gearing up to handle increased salvage activity following catastrophic weather events like the recent hurricanes and tropical storms in the U.S. and flooding in Europe.


"We have invested massively in this, anticipating more severe weather over the years to come," Liaw said. "We have bought and built catastrophic yards that in many cases have run idle simply awaiting a catastrophic event to service our customers again." 


However, there are indications that used-car prices are leveling off after skyrocketing earlier this year. If chip shortages and other supply-chain issues ease, new-car production could rebound, pressuring used-car prices.

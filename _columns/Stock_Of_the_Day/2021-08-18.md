**Mercado Libre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the largest e-commerce company in Latin America has moved into a buy range. MELI stock is trading near its record high.




Following its second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 4, MELI stock shot up 14%, as revenue doubled to $1.7 billion. Adjusted earnings jumped 23% to $1.37 a share, obliterating views for 11 cents.


Since then, MELI stock has been forming a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with an entry point of 2,020.10, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool?ParentId=1&ListId=86818&source=sitemarketcondition&target=symbolList&symbol=CPE) analysis. The buy range extends to 2,121.11. Buying MELI stock above that buy range entails [more risk](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/).


Mercado Libre also is setting up for a lower buy point. After Wednesday, the cup base will have a handle. The entry on this [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) is 1,899.43, extending the buy zone to 1,994.40. Also, don't forget the [automatic sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) that's triggered when a stock falls 7% to 8% below your entry price.

Shares of Mercado Libre climbed 0.9% to close at 1,784.13 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Mercado Libre Has Big Lead On Amazon
------------------------------------


Based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mercado Libre is the largest provider of e-commerce services in Latin America, and has a big leg up on industry behemoth **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), at least in its own backyard.


As of April, Mercado Libre received nearly 668 million monthly visits within Latin America, according to [researcher Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/321543/latin-america-online-retailer-visitors/). Amazon was a distant second for that region, with 169 million.


Mercado Libre provides an e-commerce marketplace for buyers and sellers. Moreover, it hosts platforms where users can create online stores. It also provides financial services technology.


E-commerce sales jumped 96% to $1.14 billion in the second quarter. Revenue from financial technology services grew 89% to $560.4 million. It processed $7 billion in gross merchandise volume, up 46%. Active users climbed 47% to 75.9 million.


MELI Stock: Facing Competition
------------------------------


Mercado Libre's financial business, called Mercado Pago, allows users to make contactless payments, pay utility bills, make peer-to-peer transactions and pay for transportation tickets, among other things. Mercado Pago faces competition in digital payments from Brazil-based **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)).


For the third quarter, analysts expect revenue of $1.86 billion, up 70% from the year-ago period. They predict adjusted earnings will more than quadruple to $1.15 a share, up from 28 cents a year ago, according to FactSet.


"We believe that our business is showing tremendous momentum despite immense volatility in our key markets due to the frequent closing of physical retail across Latin America," Chief Financial Officer Pedro Arnt said during a conference call with analysts after the earnings report. "Additionally, three of our top markets — Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico — were listed among the top five growth markets globally."


Mercado Libre gets about 93% of revenue from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. The remaining 7% comes from Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Venezuela and Ecuador, among other countries. In total, Mercado Libre operates in 18 countries.


Fast-Growing Internet Population
--------------------------------


The company held its U.S. initial public offering in 2007 on the Nasdaq. MELI stock priced at 18 and now trades above 1,780.


According to Statista, Latin America has a population of more than 635 million people. It has one of the fastest-growing internet penetration rates in the world.


It also shows no signs of slowing down. Statista estimates total e-commerce gross merchandise volume in Latin America will top $94.7 billion this year, up 13%. It sees that volume growing an additional 10.5% in 2022.


Following the earnings report, Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni maintained a buy rating on MELI stock with a price target of 2,000.

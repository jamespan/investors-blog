**Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares of the cancer treatment specialist break out following a strong fourth-quarter sales report.




The company makes several medical devices that use electricity to interrupt the growth of tumor cells. Earlier this week, [Novocure pre-reported](https://www.novocure.com/novocure-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-preliminary-net-revenues-and-provides-company-update/) $99.2 million in fourth-quarter revenue, topping estimates for $95.4 million, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said.


Shares of Novocure are now breaking out above a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 90.10. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Novocure [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) surged 11.8% to 94.38. Volume was heavy as shares broke out, a good sign.


Electricity In Cancer Treatment
-------------------------------


Novocure got its start in 2000, testing a theory that a medical device utilizing electricity could interrupt the growth of tumor cells. In 2011, Novocure gained its first Food and Drug Administration approval for a cancer treatment device called Optune.

At the time, Optune only treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma, a brain cancer. To use Optune, the patient must apply a sticky adhesive to their shaved head. An additional piece of technology inside a backpack or purse controls the electrical component.


In 2015, 2016 and 2019, Novocure gained new approvals. Today, the Optune device can treat newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma. Novocure also has a next-generation version of Optune, plus a new device that can treat mesothelioma, a lung cancer.


Total Prescription Growth Lags
------------------------------


Despite strong preliminary fourth-quarter sales, Novocure reported 5% growth in total prescriptions, below expectations, Evercore's Kumar said.


The cancer treatment specialist is putting its might into expanding the number of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients using its Optune system. Meanwhile, Novocure is seeing a decline among recurrent glioblastoma patients.


"Total prescriptions is a key metric for the Street and (the) headline number has been trending light mainly due to declines in recurrent glioblastoma total prescriptions (while key new glioblastoma has grown double-digit)," he said.



Previously, he thought this was mainly a U.S. phenomenon. But during the quarter ended in December, total U.S. prescriptions beat expectations, while the Europe, Middle East and Asia geographic segment lagged by 20%.


"All in, while holders will cheer the consistent revenue beat, total prescriptions has been a focus and we suspect will be topic for debate," he said.


Timeline For Clinical Studies Unchanged
---------------------------------------


Still, Executive Chairman William Doyle remained upbeat during a presentation at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Optune currently is used by 30% of patients with glioblastoma, he said, according to Kumar.


Kumar sees no limit to continued growth. The cancer treatment specialist simply must educate doctors and patients. Further, Medicare reimbursement hasn't kicked in yet, but should be available later this year — likely stoking additional patient use.


The medical devices company also is working to expand in Israel, Switzerland and Japan.


It's also important to note, there hasn't been any change in timelines. Novocure expects to have the results of studies in patients with brain metastases in 2021, in lung and pancreatic cancers in 2022 and in ovarian cancer in 2024.


Highly Rated Cancer Treatment Stock
-----------------------------------


Novocure has a strong [Investor's Business Daily Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95. The RS Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. This puts Novocure stock in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of performance.


In addition, the cancer treatment stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 83. This puts Novocure stock in the top 17% of all stocks in terms of key growth rates.

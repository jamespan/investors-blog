**CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as a tight supply for new cars boosts the used car market, while digital sales also buoy earnings.




CarMax's network of 220 stores nationwide sold more than 830,000 used cars in its last financial year. Overall used vehicle sales are expected to rise 2.9% in 2021 to 39.3 million, according to Cox Automotive.


CarMax Stock Technical Analysis
-------------------------------


The nation's No. 1 used car retailer topped a 128.68 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) off a flat base Monday. On Tuesday, shares rose 132 intraday before reversing lower, closing down 0.3% to 128.82, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). CarMax stock is in buy range to 135.11. The [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) is part of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/), a sign of strength in a choppy market.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) made a new high as the stock broke out, another bullish sign. A rising RS line means a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown.



CarMax holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 74 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That means it has outperformed 74% of all stocks in the past year. Its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is a solid 88.


The auto retail/wholesale group ranks a middling 74 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, but several auto dealers are showing strength in addition to KMX stock. It also includes **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)), **Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)) and **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)). AutoNation stock is extended from a buy zone. Group 1 is holding in a buy zone from a handle entry while Lithia Motors is just below buy point.


CarMax Earnings Outlook
-----------------------


On key fundamental metrics, CarMax scores well. It earns an [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 90 out of 99 and an [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=SMR+Rating&termid=1) of B, on a scale of A+ to a worst E.


CarMax shows two quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth, as the car dealer recovers from the pandemic. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, CarMax earnings jumped 37% as sales grew 8%, even though a surge in Covid-19 cases weighed on foot traffic as the quarter went on. In Q1 2021, earnings had dived 86% and sales crumbled 40%.


Analysts expect CarMax earnings to fall 18% in all of the just-ended fiscal 2021 and to rebound 31% in 2022. Sales are seen falling 7% in all of 2021 and growing 16.5% in 2022.


Over the past three years, CarMax earnings per share grew 8% on average. A CANSLIM investor generally would want to see annual EPS growth above 25% [in a top growth stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). But keep in mind earnings acceleration at CarMax in its latest two quarters and big beats in the latest three quarters, despite the pandemic.


In another positive sign, CarMax stock shows one quarter of rising fund ownership.


Used Car Boom, Digital Sales
----------------------------


CarMax is benefit not just from rising used car sales and pricing but also from a growing digital business.


For Q3, it reported more than 50% of customers chose to advance their transaction online. It has expanded in home delivery and contactless curbside pickup, tapping new avenues of growth.


"We are on track for most of our customers to have the ability to buy vehicle online independently if they choose by the middle of next fiscal year," CEO Bill Nash said on an earnings call last December.


Meanwhile, more consumers moved to the used car market during the pandemic. At the same time, used car prices rose on a combination of factors.


The pandemic strained Americans' wallets, forcing consumers to hold on to old cars longer and making fewer used cars available for sale. People also sought to avoid mass transportation. Rising new car prices also turned more shoppers to the used market.


Those trends benefited CarMax and its peers, including **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) and **Shift** ([SFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFT)).


In Q3 2021, total used car unit sales rose 1%, CarMax said. Average retail selling prices rose nearly $700 per unit vs. the year-ago quarter.

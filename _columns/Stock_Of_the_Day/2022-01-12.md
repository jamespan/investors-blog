**Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the producer of phosphates and potash enjoys high prices and an investment climate that's fertile for commodities stocks. MOS stock cleared a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) buy point Wednesday.




Strong demand as farmers enjoy high crop prices, production snags and China's ban of phosphate exports at least through June have worked to buoy fertilizer prices. While prices could be hitting a peak, strength should continue in the first half of 2022 and only "erode slowly" in the second half of the year, Piper Sandler analyst Charles Neivert wrote in a Dec. 16 note.


In Mosaic's November sales update that day, the Tampa-based company stuck by guidance for phosphate average sales prices in Q4 to rise by $55-$65 per ton vs. Q3. The sequential potash price increase was expected to be at the low end of Mosaic's guidance range of $110-$130 per ton. The company added that port congestion in Brazil had shifted higher-priced sales in tons to Q1 of 2022.


Piper Sandler's Neivert initiated coverage of MOS stock with an overweight rating and 44 price target, highlighting Mosaic's low valuation and the outlook for favorable fertilizer pricing.

Wall Street analysts expect Mosaic earnings to vault nearly 500% to $5.06 a share for 2021, then climb 68% to $8.51 in 2022, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Sales growth has accelerated for the past four quarters.


MOS Stock Analysis
------------------


MOS stock rose 3.8% to 41.91 Wednesday after reaching 42.61 intraday. The move carried MOS stock past a 41.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a 12-week cup-with-handle base, according to a [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Volume was running well above average, a sign of conviction among institutional buyers.


MOS stock had broken out in early October, hitting a record high 43.24 on Oct. 20, then faltered after its third-quarter report on Nov. 1. Mosaic missed on both the top and bottom line, amid lost production due to Hurricane Ida and a mechanical failure, while higher input costs cut into profits from higher prices.


Shares rebounded after finding support at their 200-day line in early December.


MOS stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hasn't yet recovered to its October highs. However, MOS has an excellent 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a single rating that combines both fundamental and technical factors.

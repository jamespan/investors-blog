Adobe stock blasted into the buy zone on Friday after the maker of digital media and marketing software posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street's targets. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) also is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




The San Jose, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $2.29 a share on sales of $2.99 billion in the [quarter ended Nov. 29](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-earnings-q4-2019-adbe-stock/). On a year-over-year basis, Adobe earnings jumped 25% while sales rose 21%. Analysts expected Adobe earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $2.976 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.


It was Adobe's second straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth.

Adobe Stock Breaks Out Of Cup-With-Handle Base
----------------------------------------------


Adobe has three cloud-computing businesses. Creative Cloud provides software applications for graphic designers, photographers and other creative professionals. Document Cloud offers services based on its Acrobat PDF industry standard. Experience Cloud provides marketing software and services.


The company's Experience Cloud showed strong momentum in the fourth quarter as it continues to gain "reference customers" who can demonstrate the value of its services, Murphy said.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Adobe stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 310.10, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. In intraday trading, Adobe stock climbed to an all-time high of 321.57, but remained in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). Shares ended the trading day up 3.9% to 317.94.


Adobe stock currently ranks No. 24 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks. It also is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) list of top stocks.


Adobe Stock Gets Flurry Of Price-Target Hikes
---------------------------------------------


At least 15 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on Adobe stock after the company's report late Thursday.


Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock and raised his price target to 370 from 350.


"ADBE remains a top pick," he said in a note to clients. "All three Cloud segments are benefiting from the digital transformation secular trend."


While Adobe's guidance for its fiscal first quarter came in lighter than views, analysts said that was nothing to be concerned about. The company's full-year revenue outlook was slightly ahead of forecasts.

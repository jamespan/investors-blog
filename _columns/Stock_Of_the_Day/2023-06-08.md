**Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the flooring retailer sets up near an official buy point even as recent data shows existing homes sales falling and mortgage applications falling to near 30-year lows. FND edged lower Thursday, but is still actionable from an early entry.




FND stock was added to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) on Wednesday.


The Georgia-based Floor & Decor is a specialty retailer of flooring materials and related accessories for home building and remodeling. The company was founded in 2000. At the end of the first quarter, Floor & Decor was operating 194 warehouse stores in 36 states. The company plans to open 32-35 locations by the end of 2023.


On May 4, Floor & Decor narrowly missed Q1 analyst estimates for earnings and topped revenue views. Floor & Decor profits dropped 1% to 66 cents per share while sales increased around 9% to $1.12 billion. The company reported same-store sales falling 3.3%.


CEO Tom Taylor told investors at the time the company was working on "adapting to the significant year-over-year declines in existing home sales and broader macroeconomic challenges. "


"As consumers prioritize value and savings, we are capitalizing on our low prices and value options," Taylor said.


The company expects full-year sales around $4.61 billion-$4.75 billion. Floor & Decor also predicts comparable-store sales remaining flat vs. 2022 up to a 3% gain. Full-year profits are expected to be $2.55-$2.85 per share.


Analysts expect Floor & Decor earnings per share to fall 4% to $2.64 in 2023. Wall Street forecasts full-year revenue gaining 9% to $4.64 billion. A rebound is expected in 2024.


Existing-Homes Fall In April
----------------------------


Existing-home sales offer an important economic data point for Floor & Decor's business. Over the past couple of years, existing-home sales have slumped from above a 6-million-unit annual rate in 2021, fueled by a Covid-era housing boom, to a 4 million rate in January.


However, on May 18, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) released data showing existing-home sales retreated 3.4% in April, compared to a month earlier, and dropped more than 23% vs a year ago. NAR data showed the median existing-home sales price slipped around 2% from one year ago to $388,800. As prices fell, the inventory of unsold existing homes increased 7.2% from the previous month.


Experts report that homeowners are holding onto existing houses in order to stick with their low-interest rate mortgages.


New home sales [improved for the fifth straight month in April](https://www.investors.com/news/toll-brothers-sales-expected-to-slip-as-housing-market-sends-mixed-signals/), the Commerce Department reported on May 23, the most recent data available. The rise was modest, from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 656,000 to 686,000.


Meanwhile, mortgage applications for home purchases dropped 1.4% in the week ended June 2, the second-lowest level since 1995, the Mortgage Bankers Association announced Wednesday.

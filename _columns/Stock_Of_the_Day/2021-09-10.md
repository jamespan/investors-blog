Third Time's A Charm?
---------------------


Entegris stock has moved higher in fits and starts this year. In fact, its [current base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) is at least its third try at a third-stage base in 2021. Entegris stock reached its record high 126.41 on two days this year â€” on April 5 and on Aug. 4.


Other semiconductor equipment stocks are near all-time highs including **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Kulicke & Soffa Industries** ([KLIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLIC)).


Entegris stock is in the [IBD Long-Term Leaders Portfolio](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), as is ASML.


Better-Than-Expected Industry Growth
------------------------------------


Global semiconductor equipment billings surged 48% year over year to a record high of $24.9 billion in the second quarter, trade group [SEMI reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/second-quarter-2021-global-semiconductor-equipment-billings-surge-48-year-over-year-to-record-high-of-24-billion-semi-reports-301367801.html). Billings rose 5% from the first quarter this year, the group said.


Chipmakers are adding new capacity to meet surging demand for semiconductors across industries. They also are investing in cutting-edge equipment to make next-generation chips.


Speaking at the recent Deutsche Bank Technology Conference, Entegris Chief Executive Bertrand Low said industry growth in 2021 has been much better than the company initially expected. The growth has been driven by strengthening demand in DRAM and Nand memory chips and from mainstream semiconductor fabs, Low said.


The company's growth rate so far this year is significantly outperforming its three-year compound annual growth rate target of 9% to 10%, Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho said in a note to clients Thursday. Entegris will likely revisit its midterm growth targets in the fourth quarter, Ho said.


"The company is increasingly more bullish about its growth opportunities, including higher Entegris content per wafer, as well as more volumes migrating to the leading-edge nodes," Ho said.


However, Ho rates Entegris stock as hold.

**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). It's been just over a year since its initial public offering, and analysts are sizing up its competition with **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) in digitizing contract paperwork.




DocuSign stock is trading about 6% below an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Earnings aren't due until mid-June.


The company went public at 29 in April 2018. Shares rallied amid a strong run by many software companies in the first nine months of 2018.


DocuSign stock hit an intraday high of 68.35 on Aug. 28. Although DocuSign posted better-than-expected earnings in September, shares swooned. Software stocks in general weakened in that September, a precursor to a big sell-off in technology stocks in the fourth quarter.

DocuSign stock bottomed on Dec. 24 and went on to form a cup chart pattern, but its depth at 49% is greater than desired. In March, DocuSign reported solid fiscal fourth-quarter results. It forecast fiscal 2020 revenue and billings growth well ahead of consensus estimates.


DocuSign Relative Strength Line Unimpressive
--------------------------------------------


While its chart seemed to form a handle in recent weeks — also deeper than desired at 15% — a better view is that it's forming a new base. Either way, its entry point has been reset at 59.72.


DocuSign has a Relative Strength Rating of 86 out of a possible 99.


The best stocks, meanwhile, tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. DocuSign's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/), meanwhile, is unimpressive. The RS line compares a stock's price performance against that of the S&P 500.


An upward-trending RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


DocuSign Market Share Bigger Than Adobe's
-----------------------------------------


Aside from Adobe, DocuSign competes with startup HelloSign. The company's tools automate the electronic filing of contracts and digital certificates. Its software prepares agreements and certifies electronic signatures.


DocuSign holds about 70% of the market, but Adobe is much bigger. Adobe mainly sells digital media and marketing software.


DocuSign is well-positioned vs. Adobe, Furby said in a March note to clients, following a meeting with company management.


"Adobe is a formidable player and the next largest vendor at roughly 20% share," said Furby. "But DocuSign is only aware of a couple of handfuls of customers it has lost to Adobe over the years, while it has replaced Adobe Sign hundreds of times."


DocuSign Eyes Federal Government Sales
--------------------------------------


"Just as important, we believe this is a market that can support multiple vendors of scale," the analyst added.


DocuSign in 2018 acquired SpringCM for $220 million. It's still integrating SpringCM products into its offerings.


Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin says federal government sales could kick in for DocuSign in calendar 2021.


"We see the expansion of DocuSign into a multi-product solution as well as penetration of the federal vertical as two key growth opportunities over the next few years," he said in his March note to clients.


DocuSign stock climbed 2.1% to 56.06 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

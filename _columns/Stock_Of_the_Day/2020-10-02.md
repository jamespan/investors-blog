**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the internet cloud communications software maker impressed Wall Street with its virtual investor day presentation. On Friday, Twilio stock rocketed despite it being a mostly down day for the stock market.




Twilio stock earned a bunch of price-target hikes from analysts following its investor day event on Thursday. It was the San Francisco-based company's first such event in three years.


Twilio executives said they expect the company's sales growth to exceed 30% in each of the next four years. Wall Street had been modeling 25% growth in 2021 and 23% growth in 2022.


RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin reiterated his outperform rating on Twilio stock and upped his price target to 375 from 320.

Twilio Stock Breaks Out Of Double-Bottom Base
---------------------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Twilio stock jumped 13% to close at 290.36. Earlier in the session, it broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 283.44. In intraday trading, Twilio stock notched a record high of 295.52.


"Twilio is the clear market leader in one of the largest markets in enterprise software," Zukin said in a note to clients. "Twilio is benefiting from two key end-market trends: the growing pressure on companies to build their own software to drive greater customer satisfaction; and the increasing importance of digital agility in sectors across the economy."


While its market is attracting new competitors, such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Twilio executives are confident they can maintain their industry leadership, Zukin said.


Twilio offers a cloud communications platform for voice, text, chat, video and email applications.


Covid-19 Pandemic Fuels Need For Twilio Offerings
-------------------------------------------------


Cowen analyst Derrick Wood kept his outperform rating on Twilio stock and raised his price target to 350 from 310. He also reiterated his "top pick" designation for the stock.


Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall said the Covid-19 pandemic made cloud communications services a necessity for businesses.


"We think a growing need for digital customer engagement and for businesses to understand how to optimize those channels will fuel Twilio's continued innovation, allowing it to maintain market leadership and helping it achieve (its) 30%+ growth targets," she said in a note to clients.


Marshall maintained her overweight rating on Twilio stock and increased her price target to 270 from 240.

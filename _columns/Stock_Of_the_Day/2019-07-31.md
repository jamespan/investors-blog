**IBD Stock Of The Day Update:** L3 Harris stock blasted higher Wednesday after the [F-35 supplier's fiscal Q4 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/f35-suppliers-l3-harris-mercury-earnings/) topped views. L3 Harris stock jumped 4.8% to 209.55, decisively reclaiming a 200.87 buy point after trading just above or below the entry over the prior week. Shares are just within the 5% chase zone that runs up to 210.91. Another F-35 supplier, **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)), shot up to a buy point on its own results as defense earnings and stocks lead.

**L3 Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and is close to retaking a buy point ahead of earnings next week, as defense stocks overall surge on strong quarterly results.




The company is the result of last year's merger between Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies. The company makes battlefield communications systems, night-vision devices, sensors and satellite communications. It's been tasked to develop a computer processor for **Lockheed Martin**'s ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) F-35 joint strike fighter.


Defense stocks have been active with key mergers in recent months. Last year, aircraft-parts maker **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) bought Esterline Technologies, **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) bought Orbital ATK, and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) bought KLX. Earlier this year, **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)) announced it would merge with **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)).


L3 Harris Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------


Shares closed up 1.4% at 200.67 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), after rising as high as 202.96 earlier this session to briefly clear a 200.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). Volume was weak, and breakouts ideally should coincide with strong volume. On Wednesday, the stock gapped up above its 50-day average, after hugging the line in recent weeks.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-l3harris-technologies-lhx.aspx) tool, L3 Harris stock has a 97 out of 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and an 87 EPS Rating.


L3 Harris stock is also in the top 10 of the best-performing defense stocks tracked by IBD. And the aerospace/defense group it's in is also ranked No. 11 out of the 197 industry groups IBD follows.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for L3 Harris is trending higher but is not currently at its most recent high. The RS line is the blue line in the chart below and tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line should hit a new high before or as the stock is breaking out.



L3 Harris Earnings Due As Defense Stocks Beat
---------------------------------------------


The company is set to announce fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect EPS to climb 29% to $2.30 with revenue up 8% to $1.8 billion.


But investors should be wary of buying stocks right before earnings as even a slightly weaker-than-expected result could send shares tumbling.


Still, Q2 results so far from top defense stocks have been encouraging. Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon, **General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)) and **Hexcel** ([HXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HXL)) reported strong [earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/northrop-earnings-general-dynamics-earnings-raytheon-earnings-q2-2019/) this week, fueling robust gains this week among the defense stocks.


Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on L3 Harris with a $240 price target when it started covering the defense contractor earlier this month.


Defense stocks have been good buys as they held up better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the recent correction. Also, Congress just approved a 3% increase in the Pentagon's budget, to $738 billion for 2020.

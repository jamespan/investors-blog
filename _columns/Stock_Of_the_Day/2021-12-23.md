**Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), seems to have just about everything going its way. The pandemic sped up a secular shift to electronic trading. Trading platform innovations have helped spark market-share gains for the New York-based firm. Even coming Fed rate hikes look like a positive. TW stock, which held up much better than most through the recent volatility, sprang above a key level in today's stock-market action, flashing a buying opportunity.




TW stock is part of the flagship [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/#) stock list. Also, Tradeweb joined IBD's elite [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/) portfolio on Thursday.


Tradeweb Business Momentum
--------------------------


Tradeweb Markets notched 30% EPS growth in Q2 and Q3 on revenue growth of 23% and 25%, respectively. Multiple growth avenues are showing a lot of promise.


Portfolio trading, which allows clients to package multiple bonds into a single package, grew more than 180% from a year ago to $80 billion in Q3, Tradeweb said on the Oct. 28 earnings call. Tradeweb's AllTrade, which provides anonymous trading across all market segments, saw volume grow 75% to $88 billion.


"We remain excited by the multiyear opportunity we believe we have here as we scale our growth initiatives, the market electronifies and the rate cycle turns," Tradeweb CEO Lee Olesky said.

Fed Rate Hikes A Plus
---------------------


"Recent interest rate movements have added potential cyclical tailwinds to already positive secular growth trends," Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon wrote in a Dec. 6 note.


Elevated interest rate volatility is a positive for trading volumes, he noted. A steeper yield curve also would be positive for Tradeweb fee rates. A third potential benefit is revitalized retail activity that comes with higher fee rates.


Tradeweb Stock Analysis
-----------------------


Tradeweb stock rose 3.8% to 98.89 in Thursday [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), briefly hitting a record 99.49. The gap higher continued a bounce off TW stock's 50-day and 10-week moving average. Notably, TW stock broke above a downward-sloping trend line, flashing a buy signal.



A rebound off the 50-day and [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-why-the-10-week-line-offers-follow-on-buy-points/), especially when that line is above the prior buy point, offers a good chance to buy leading stocks at a discount. That's the case for Tradeweb stock, which cleared an 89.89 buy point from a cup base on Nov. 2.


Tradeweb stock has been carving out a [four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool). That's impressive action, given the recent market downdraft. It also sets up an additional 99.35 buy point, just above the peak of the tight formation. That would have been a flat base after Thursday's close if TW stock hadn't moved to a new high. Still, investors can treat 99.35 as a legitimate entry.


TW stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the chart provided that tracks its progress vs. the S&P 500, is just below an all-time high.

ICE stock also saw a bullish bounce off its 10-week average, while CME stock is in buy range. Nasdaq and CBOE are both right at their 50-day lines.

**DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the leading provider of meal delivery services announced third-quarter results along with an $8.1 billion acquisition to expand global ambitions. DoorDash stock surged Wednesday.




The company reported [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/doordash-stock-wavers-quarterly-earnings-report/) late Tuesday and issued fourth-quarter guidance that was in line with expectations.

The stock initially shot above a buy point of 220.71 from a [double-bottom pattern,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) but pulled back. The buy point extends to 231.17. Stocks beyond the buy point pose greater risks.


For its third quarter, DoorDash reported an adjusted loss of 30 cents a share on revenue of $1.3 billion. Analysts expected DoorDash to report a loss of 26 cents on revenue of $1.18 billion. Revenue jumped 45% from the year-ago period as total orders grew 47% to $347 million.

Meal Delivery: Consolidating And Competitive
--------------------------------------------


The meal delivery market is consolidating and highly competitive. Last year European food delivery company **Just Eat Takeaway** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) [acquired GrubHub](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/grubhub-stock-merger-talks-european-food-delivery-company/) in an all-stock deal valued at $7.3 billion. Also, **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) acquired Postmates for $2.65 billion.


The [acquisition of Helsinki-based Wolt](https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Joins-Forces-with-Wolt/default.aspx) expands the reach of DoorDash into 23 new countries. The new territory includes Northern Europe, Israel and Japan. Wolt has about 4,000 employees.


"We are positive on the acquisition as it accelerates the opportunity in Europe while raising the floor on potential outcomes for DASH's inevitable entrance into the geography," Needham analyst Chris Pierce said in a note to clients. He maintained a buying rating on DoorDash stock and raised his price target to 270, from 240.


The deal is DoorDash's biggest purchase to date.


Global Platform Supporting DoorDash Stock
-----------------------------------------


"We have an opportunity to build a global platform for local commerce in the internet era," DoorDash Chief Executive Tony Xu said in the announcement. "We expect to increase our international scale, accelerate our product development, and improve our investment efficiency."


DoorDash has expanded its services beyond restaurant takeaway to delivering groceries and retail goods.


Last week, DoorDash [announced a partnership](https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Partners-with-Ulta-Beauty-to-Launch-Same-Day-Delivery/default.aspx) with retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)). It plans to offer same-day delivery from select Ulta Beauty stores in five cities, with plans to expand and roll out more broadly in 2022. It also has a partnership with **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)).


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-doordash-inc-cl-a-dash.htm) tool shows that DoorDash stock has a weak [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 43 out of 99. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors easily gauge a stock's strengths.


The stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 64. This means DASH has now outperformed 64% of all companies in the IBD database.


The company held its [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/doordash-ipo-initial-public-offering-pricing-uber-dash/) in December that raised $3.4 billion. DoorDash stock is up 50% this year.

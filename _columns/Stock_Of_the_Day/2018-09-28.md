**Blucora** ([BCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCOR)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the rival of **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) in personal finance software jumped into a buy zone following an upgrade tied to the 2019 tax season.




Blucora stock surged 8.6% to close at 40.25 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Shares in Blucora traded up 10.5% in intraday trading, touching a technical buy point of 40.95. The company's stock edged above its 50-day moving average on Sept. 17, a bullish sign.


Intuit held its annual investor day on Thursday, where management commented on the 2019 tax season.Â It's the first tax year affected by the Trump administration's tax reform. Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act late last year.


Blucora's assets include TaxAct Holdings, which sells software for individuals looking to prepare their own taxes. Intuit sells TurboTax software, a competing digital product.

JPMorgan analyst William Cuddy on Friday upgraded Blucore stock to overweight from hold. Cuddy hiked his price target on Blucora to 45 from 42.


Blucora Could Hike Tax Software Prices
--------------------------------------


"We see reduced risk from TurboTax competing on price in the TaxAct (do it yourself) segment and see increased likelihood of TaxAct average selling prices increasing in the range of low to middle 20% in 2019, with flattish units sold," Cuddy said in his report to clients.


Intuit stock rose 1.7% to 226.70 on Friday. Aside from Intuit, Blucore competes with H&R Block and Credit Karma.


Blucora stock jumped 23% to 31 on May 9 after the company reported fiscal first-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations. The stock gained 32% more, hitting an intraday high of 40.60 on June 7, before the stock consolidated as investors took profits.


Blucora's HD Vest, Another Business Unit
----------------------------------------


In addition to TaxAct software, Blucora owns HD Vest, which focuses on providing wealth management solutions to tax professionals.


One company goal is converting some of the 3.8 million users into HD Vest advisor clients, William Blair analyst Chris Shutler said in a recent note to clients.


"If it can eventually prove out the potential for TaxAct to be a referral engine, we believe it would make HD Vest a more attractive place for advisors to hang their shingle," Shutler said.


Blucora aims to strike distribution deals with large retailers and e-tailers for TaxAct, says Shutler. The company's balance sheet, meanwhile, is strong enough to make acquisitions.


"Management's priorities seem to be centered on tax-focused broker-dealers, tax-pro software companies, and practice management solutions for tax pros or advisors," Shutler said.


Lower Unit Volumes But Higher Prices
------------------------------------


One issue for all companies in the personal finance software market is that more consumers could take standard deductions as the result of Trump tax reform. That could result in lower volume sales, since individuals would not need software to sort out complex deductions.


Blucora could get a boost if Intuit hikes prices to offset lower unit sales, Shutler said. Intuit already sells the highest-priced products.


At JPMorgan, Cuddy has a similar view.


"Intuit management believes it can continue to raise prices in complex, do-it-yourself tax software," Cuddy said. "We expect (Blucora's) TaxAct will follow TurboTax's pricing increases and further narrow its discount to TurboTax for 2019."


Blucora and Intuit are members of IBD's Computer-Software Financial group. Its ranked [No. 13 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-sep-27-2018/). **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)), **Jack Henry Associates** ([JKHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKHY)) and Inuit have the highest [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) in the group.

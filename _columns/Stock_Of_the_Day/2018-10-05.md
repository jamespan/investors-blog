CLOSE




Shares broke out on Sept. 25, soaring 7.1% to 53.98, rebounding from the 50-day line in powerful volume to clear a 53.51 buy point. Planet Fitness stock also rose the following session. But then it began pulling back. On Tuesday, shares skidded 3.85%, undercutting the buy point.


On Wednesday, shares fell as much as 7.4% below the buy point. Investors could certainly be justified in just bailing at that point. But Planet Fitness did close just above its 50-day line Wednesday and gain on Thursday.



Market Indexes, Top Stocks Struggle
-----------------------------------


Also during these days, numerous other growth stocks were falling below buy points or key support levels. With the Nasdaq composite tumbling through its 50-day line Thursday, racking up its ninth distribution day, the market direction switched to uptrend under pressure.


The stock market was selling off sharply again on Friday, led by growth names such as Planet Fitness.


When the major market averages and leading stocks sell off, investors should be a little less lenient with their stocks and consider taking losses quickly and banking some profits.


Planet Fitness Stock Worth Watching
-----------------------------------


Planet Fitness will now have to regroup and build a new base, as its breakout from a six-week flat base has failed. The pattern was already at a higher chance of failure, as MarketSmith analysis shows it was a third stage base. First and second stage bases are more likely to succeed.


However investors should keep a close eye on the top stock for new entry opportunities. It still has a good-but-not-great IBD Composite Rating of 91. In addition its EPS Rating of 97 and Relative Strength Rating of 95 are both excellent.


Earnings have been accelerating for the past three quarters.


Planet Fitness has been a success by going after casual members rather than avid gym goers. By touting a "judgment-free" atmosphere and cheap membership, Planet Fitness appeals to a broad range of Americans looking to get into shape.

The company provides and connects borrowers with loans for things like debt consolidation, home improvement, weddings, purchases for boats and motorcycles, and car repairs and refinancing. It offers secured loans, or loans tied to collateral, and unsecured loans.



OneMain Earnings
----------------


At the end of 2018, OneMain Holdings had $16.2 billion of personal loans due from some 2.4 million customer accounts across 44 states, according to its most recent annual report.


OneMain earned $1.96 a share for the fourth quarter, up 54% vs. a year earlier and beating Zacks estimates for $1.72. Revenue of $855 million beat expectations for $832 million. The 14% gain was the third straight quarter of slowly accelerating top-line growth.


However, analysts have forecast OneMain earnings growth in the single digits for 2020 and 2021.


OneMain hiked its quarterly dividend by 32% to 33 cents a share. It also declared a special payout of $2.50 a share.


Originations climbed 13% during the quarter to $3.7 billion. The net charge-off ratio was 5.71%, down from the prior year. OneMain's 30-89 day delinquency ratio crept higher, to 2.47%. Its 90-day delinquency ratio was 2.11%, down slightly.


OneMain said it serves primarily "non-prime" customers. "Non-prime" loans, to some extent, have become the industry's preferred term for what were once known as subprime loans, the loans often blamed for tanking the economy more than a decade ago.


But with the economy doing relatively well and wages rising, especially for workers at the lower end of the pay scale, non-prime loans are profitable.


OneMain's customers, the report said, "have limited access to credit from banks, credit card companies and other traditional lenders." At the time the report was filed, the company estimated that there were around 100 million borrowers in the U.S. in its primary market.


Those borrowers, it estimated, had around $1.2 trillion outstanding for personal loans, vehicle loans and credit cards.

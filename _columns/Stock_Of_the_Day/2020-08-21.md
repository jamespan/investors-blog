The company has created a long runway of business opportunities. In addition to its various e-commerce platforms for businesses and consumers, Alibaba also operates digital media and entertainment properties, as well a cloud computing group.


Big Push Into Cloud Computing
-----------------------------


Four months ago, Alibaba announced plans to invest $28 billion over three years in its cloud infrastructure. This includes investments in operating-system software, servers and chips, and the expansion of its data centers.


Similar to **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Alibaba also has made a big push into groceries and increasingly focuses on brick-and-mortar retail operations. Another growth driver comes from international expansion.


For a megacap stock, Alibaba continues to deliver torrid growth.


On Thursday, Alibaba reported [fiscal first-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-earnings-q1-2021-alibaba-stock/) that beat estimates, as pandemic-fueled buying led to a 34% growth rate in its core e-commerce business.


"We were well positioned to capture growth from the ongoing digital transformation, which has been accelerated by the pandemic, in both consumption and enterprise operations," Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said on the [earnings conference call with analysts](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/alibaba-group-holding-ltd-baba-q1-2021-earnings-ca/).


"Alibaba is a key beneficiary of this development with most of our businesses, including core commerce and cloud computing, having recovered and resumed healthy growth," Zhang said.


Total revenue jumped 34% to $21.76 billion, above views of $21.3 billion. Adjusted earnings climbed 15% to $2.10 per share, comfortably above estimates of $1.99.


Revenue from the company's cloud computing unit jumped 59% from the year-ago period to $1.75 billion. It accounted for 8% of total revenue in the quarter.


Alibaba ended the quarter with 742 million users of its various platforms. In addition, mobile monthly active users reached 874 million.


Analyst Views On Alibaba Stock
------------------------------


Following the earnings report, Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler raised his price target on Alibaba stock to 320, from 290, with a rating of strong buy.


"Alibaba remains our top internet megacap pick," Kessler wrote in a note to clients. "We expect continued solid China e-commerce growth with Alibaba as the biggest winner."


Baird analyst Colin Sebastian has a price target of 275 on Alibaba stock with a rating of outperform.


"Alibaba's quarterly results suggest that pandemic-related storm clouds have largely passed," Sebastian wrote in a note to clients. "The company should be in a strong position to capitalize on accelerating digital services adoption rates in commerce, cloud, communications and media."


The company held its initial public offering in 2014 and remains the largest tech IPO ever.


Alibaba's closest competitor, JD.com, also turned in [solid quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-earnings-q2-jd-stock-alibaba-rival/) this week. JD.com stock climbed 1.4% to 74.98 on Friday. In intraday trading, it hit a record high of 75.72.



Alibaba Is An IBD Long-Term Leader
----------------------------------


Alibaba is on the watchlist of [IBD's Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). Some of the best times to buy these Long-Term Leaders come during the latter stages of market corrections like the current one. Stock market corrections can pull down even the best stocks. But IBD [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-long-term-stocks/)Â are companies with stable earnings growth and price performance.


The [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-alibaba-group-hldg-ads-baba.aspx) shows that Alibaba has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99. The rating means Alibaba currently outperforms 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


The stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 86 out of 99. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been trending sideways but recently began to tick up. The relative strength line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.

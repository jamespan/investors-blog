**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) is the IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and becomes the [newest member of the S&P 500](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nvidia-set-to-join-sp-100-fleetcor-technologies-to-join-sp-500-penn-virginia-to-join-sp-smallcap-600-300667280.html) on Wednesday, when it replaces Time Warner on the major index.




FleetCor shares jumped 6.45% to close at 220.44 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), hitting a record high in heavy volume. That cleared a 213.84 entry point from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) that started in January. FleetCor stock is now trading in buy range.


Looking at a weekly chart, FleetCor's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is hitting new highs not seen since October 2016. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.


FleetCor stock's 50-day moving average has been trading well above its longer term 200-day, a bullish sign, since October of last year.

The fuel-card and workforce-payment company easily topped first-quarter results in early May, posting 28% profit growth to $2.50 in earnings per share on a 17% revenue gain to $609.7 million. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research had expected $2.19 EPS and $604 million in sales. [FleetCor's guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/fleetcor-earnings-report-top-payments-stock/), however, ran a little light.


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) both gained 0.8%, **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) rose 2.7%, and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) picked up 0.6%. Square stock hit a new high Monday, while PayPal, Mastercard and Visa are just below all-time peaks.


How Stock Of The Day FleetCor Stacks Up
---------------------------------------


FleetCor announced last week that it had inked an agreement with **Casey's General Stores** ([CASY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CASY)) to [manage the convenience-store chain's fuel-card program](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/casey-general-stores-selects-fleetcor-123000558.html). Casey's, the fourth-biggest convenience store in the country, owns and operates more than 2,000 locations across 16 states in the U.S.


Other FleetCor partners in North America include Uber, Mastercard, **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), among others.


Last August, FleetCor closed a $690 million takeover of Cambridge Global Payments, a provider of business-to-business international payments.


FleetCor's current [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) stands at 95, and the company has been pegged as a [stock with a rising Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-with-rising-composite-ratings-fleetcor-technologies/). A 95 rating means that FleetCor outperforms 95% of all other publicly traded companies in key performance metrics and technical strength. All-time winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of big stock winners.


It ranks fifth in the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing industry group. Mastercard is No. 1.

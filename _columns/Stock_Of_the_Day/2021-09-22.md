'Camera Company' With Three Brands
----------------------------------


Snap calls itself a camera company, with three brands within its lineup: Snapchat, Spectacles and Bitmoji. By downloading its Snapchat app to a smartphone, users have access to a wide range of features. The Snapchat app, which is free, initially hit the market in 2011.


Users can discover and purchase fashion items, buy tickets, play games, catch up on news and entertainment and share their content with other Snapchat users. Snap is continuously adding new features and partnerships with other companies.


With [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/), users can create a digital persona in the form of a "living cartoon." Through Bitmoji users can express who they are and what they're feeling at the moment.


Another page on Snapchat, called Stories, holds a library of news reports, prank videos and chronicles of other strange occurrences. Snap also is developing original content.


During the second quarter, daily active users of Snapchat jumped 23%, or 55 million, to 293 million.


Snap Stock Jumps On Earnings Report
-----------------------------------


Snap stock gapped up nearly 24% after the company reported [second-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-soars-on-second-quarter-earnings/) on July 22 that smashed estimates, as did the outlook for its third quarter. Revenue soared 116% from the year-ago period to $982 million, well above estimates of $845 million. Adjusted earnings of 10 cents a share crushed estimates for a 1-cent per-share loss.


Snap has posted accelerating sales growth over the last four quarters.


After a long record of quarterly losses, earnings growth is moving in the right direction. Three of the past four quarters showed triple-digit earnings growth on an absolute value basis vs. prior-year losses.


Snap's latest innovation is in the cutting-edge field of augmented reality, which overlays digital images and other information into a person's field of view. Applications for the technology include navigation, education, games, commerce and more. The good news for Snap is that not only is augmented reality entertaining, [it's also a revenue driver](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/snap-stock-climbs-as-it-engages-young-crowd/). Snap recently introduced an augmented reality feature it calls "TrueSize," which consumers can use as a shopping experience.

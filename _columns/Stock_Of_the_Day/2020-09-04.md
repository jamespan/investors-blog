Discount retail chain **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). After bolting higher following earnings last month, Target stock has held up, making it a watchlist candidate and potential buy opportunity over the next few weeks.




The gains for Target come as the coronavirus pandemic steers business toward retailers that sell basic goods for low prices and that have invested heavily in e-commerce.


Target Stock
------------


Shares launched 13% higher on Aug. 19, after the company reported second-quarter earnings that breezed past analyst forecasts.


Target stock has eased from those highs since but could form a base in the weeks ahead.


Or, the stock's [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) could catch up with it. If Target stock manages to bounce higher after hitting that line, the move could represent another buying opportunity. Strong stocks often stage rebounds off the 50-day line.


Target reversed higher to close up 0.8% at 147.23 on the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). The stock fell with the broader market on Thursday, after floating near record highs.


Target's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is among the strongest — at 95 out of 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is a little less so, at 75. Target's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which compares a stock against the S&P 500, sagged from May through August, spiked after Target's Q2 earnings and then fell again.


Target stock cleared a 126.07 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) buy point last month and quickly shot up past the chase zone and into profit-taking territory.

Target Earnings
---------------


[Target obliterated second-quarter forecasts last month](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q2-2020-target-stock/). Earnings shot up 86% to $3.38 a share, with revenue up 25% to $22.98 billion. Same-store sales surged 24.3%, including an in-store gain of 10.9%. Digital sales soared 195%. Same-day services, including order pick up, drive up and online delivery, popped 273%.


Management said results "reflect the continuation of heightened sales volume and significant investments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."


The company later added that it had notched "market share gains of $5 billion in the first six months of the year."


Amid the sales boom, costs — for things like pay hikes and protective gear — have risen for stores like Target and rival **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)).


In addition, Walmart last month said that sales had started to "[normalize](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q2-2021-wmt-stock/)" as coronavirus-related stimulus aid to consumers begins to fall away.

**Cushman & Wakefield** ([CWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWK)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the U.K.-based commercial real estate services firm has posted three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. CWK stock is nearing a buy point.




Cushman & Wakefield represents real estate clients in buying, selling, financing, leasing, managing and valuing assets. The company also offers real estate research services, portfolio analysis and site selection services. It has 400 offices in 70 countries.


On Jan. 1, Cushman & Wakefield's global president, John Forrester, took over as CEO.


Cushman & Wakefield is a major player in the $16 trillion U.S. commercial real estate market. The company weathered some turbulent times in commercial real estate during the pandemic.


Get Lean, Get Bigger
--------------------


Part of its strategy has been to significantly reduce costs, a key component of its multiyear transformation to become a "leaner, more efficient and agile organization," Forrester said in an earnings call with investors on Nov. 4, 2021.


"We're on track to achieve $125 million of permanent savings this year and $250 million permanent savings in total over the past two years," he said.


Another aspect of that strategy has been making acquisitions that expand its services and geographic reach.


In the third quarter, Cushman & Wakefield announced strategic partnerships with two industry leaders, as it continues to build out its platform and service offerings.


It entered into an agreement to acquire a 40% stake in Greystone's Agency, Federal Housing and Administration, and Servicing businesses, which will round out its service offering to investors in the U.S. multifamily sector, said outgoing CEO Brett White.


Cushman & Wakefield also formed an exclusive strategic partnership with **WeWork** ([WE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WE)).Â 


"Through this partnership, we will help scale WeWork's tenant experience platform from beyond just their branded centers into the rest of the office market, starting with our clients," White said.


**Cushman & Wakefield Earnings**
--------------------------------


Cushman & Wakefield earnings skyrocketed 200% vs. a year earlier in the third quarter. Revenue grew 21% to 2.33 billion.


Consolidated fee revenue for Q3 totaled $1.7 billion, improving 27% compared with the same period a year before. Brokerage revenue, including leasing and capital markets businesses, was up 64% vs. a year ago, and up 10% vs. 2019 pre-Covid levels.


"We continue to observe a sustainable recovery in capital markets and non-office leasing," Forrester said. "As expected, office leasing continues to lag other sectors, but we are continuing to see green shoots emerge each quarter."

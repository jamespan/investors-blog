WEN stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the burger chain rebounded powerfully off a key technical level, snapping a recent downtrend to offer an early entry.




On Friday, **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)) preannounced Q4 results that showed a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA on a 13.4% revenue gain. That marks the highest sales growth in six quarters, and the fourth straight quarter of accelerating gains, just topping Q3's 13.2%.


The board of the Dublin, Ohio-based company approved doubling its quarterly dividend to 25 cents and spending $500 million on share buybacks.


Wendy's also reported a 6% rise in same-store sales and expanding margins.


In addition, the restaurant operator announced a broader organizational redesign and several executive departures as part of its long-term growth strategy.


In a separate regulatory filing, activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management said it won't pursue a Wendy's takeover bid. In May, the hedge fund said it was exploring a potential deal. Trian is the fast-food chain's largest shareholder and Peltz serves as board chair.


Trian initially invested in Wendy's in 2005 and started a push for change in 2008.

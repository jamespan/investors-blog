Also, Google stock cleared a buy point on Wednesday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Alphabet stock rose 1.5% to 121.75. Year to date, [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) is up 38%.

Google 'Holding Up Well' Against Bing
-------------------------------------


On Wednesday, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post reiterated his buy rating on Google stock with a price target of 128.


In a note to clients, Post said Google's search engine market share and traffic are "holding up well" in the face of increased competition from Bing. In February, Microsoft announced a [revamped Bing search engine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-microsoft-stock-rises-on-artificial-intelligence-plans/) with artificial intelligence technology from its partner OpenAI. OpenAI is the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT.


Google's search engine market share was 92.7% in June, up 80 basis points from a year earlier. Bing's search share was 2.8%, down 40 basis points from a year ago, based on Statcounter data.


"Web traffic data suggest Google visits are steady while Bing/ChatGPT usage slows," Post said.


Meanwhile, Google could benefit from advertiser campaigns that use AI tools to improve their targeting of search ads, he said.

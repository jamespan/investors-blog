**CoStar Group** ([CSGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSGP)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after setting up new a buy point for the first time since a 40% rally from a January breakout.




The Washington, D.C.-based CoStar provides information, analytics and marketing services to the real estate industry. Its top brands include LoopNet, Apartments.com, LandsofAmerica and BizBuySell.


The flat base is a key weapon in any canny investor's armory. The [flat base reflects unusual strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). Instead of bending lower in a weak market, a stock won't cede much ground. This means a stock wants to run higher.


CoStar stock rose 1% to close at 438.80 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). That's just below the 447.06 buy point.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is just below a record high.

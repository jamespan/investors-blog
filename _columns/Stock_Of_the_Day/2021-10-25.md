Lithium miner **Albemarle Corp**. ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), offering two potential buying opportunities, as lithium prices climb on electric-vehicle demand. ALB stock flashed an early entry Monday as it nears its official buy point.




Lithium stocks and exchange traded funds have been on the uptick in recent months as electric vehicles continue to gain mainstream popularity. The metal is a main component in the batteries needed to power EVs. Lithium prices in China hit a new high on Oct. 20 as suppliers struggle to meet surging global demand.


The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF ([LIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LIT)) was up 3.9% on Monday. Albemarle stock is its top holding. But it also holds multiple Chinese battery makers, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and Chinese manufacturer **BYD** ([BYDDF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYDDF)).


ALB Stock, Tesla, EV Stocks Soar
--------------------------------


Albemarle shares climbed 3.4% to 239.44 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


ALB stock is consolidating in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/). The handle is valid on a daily chart as of Monday's close, lowering the official [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) to 244.46.

ALB stock was added to [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) Monday.



Among other lithium miners, **Livent Corp.** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)) shares rose 2.8%, not far from a potential buy point. **Lithium Americas Corp.** ([LAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAC)) jumped 5.5%, modestly above a short consolidation.

Tesla stock surged nearly 13% to 1,024.86 after Hertz announced it would buy 100,000 Tesla EVs. **Lucid Group** ([LCID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCID)) soared more than 11%, **Xpeng Motors** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) rocketed 11.5%, and Nio rose 6.15%.

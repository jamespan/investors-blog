**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the top chipmaker finds support above its 10-week moving average line amid the recent market sell-off. AMD lately has been giving chip giant **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) a run for its money.




AMD stock hit a more than 12-year high of 34.14 on Sept. 13 before pulling back. It trended sideways for a couple of weeks before falling last week as the broader stock market weakened. But on Monday it found support above its 50-day moving average, a key technical trading level.


AMD stock jumped 3% to close at 27.24 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has been taking market share in chips for PCs and servers from crosstown rival Intel in recent quarters. AMD has earned solid reviews for its latest processors and is beating Intel in production of chips at smaller circuit sizes.

AMD Stock: Top-Rated Fabless Chip
---------------------------------


Advanced Micro Devices is the top-rated stock out of 33 companies in [IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx). It has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.


However, the overall fabless chip stock group is out of favor with investors. It currently ranks No. 106 out of 197 industry groups. Last month, it ranked No. 74.


Some analysts turned cautious on AMD stock after its multiyear high. Wall Street firms downgrading the stock to neutral or sell in recent weeks include Baird, KeyBanc Capital Markets and Northland Securities.


AMD stock is a "high-risk/high-reward name," RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said in an Oct. 3 report.


It is likely to continue to be volatile until the start of 2019 when positive catalysts emerge, he said. Those catalysts include 7-nanometer chip production and market-share gains in PCs and servers, he said. Steves reiterated his outperform rating on AMD.


Also, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su is scheduled to give a keynote speech at the [CES 2019](https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=e8a189c0-5cdf-4176-9d38-ad65a2652e47) consumer electronics show in Las Vegas on Jan. 9.

**Williams Cos.** ([WMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMB)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The natural gas stock is in a buy range and riding a six-day rally as energy prices climb.




While natural gas prices fell Tuesday, prices have been elevated since August, with winter weather in the U.S. and geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe sending U.S. prices in October and January to their highest levels since 2008. Russian troops massed at the border with Ukraine since early November have kept energy markets on edge. But Russian natgas supply to Europe rebounded Tuesday and the cold snap eased.


"Diplomatic efforts to drive more gas into Europe from other sources are ongoing; however, short-term prices remain highly exposed to small shifts in the supply-demand balance," RBC Capital Market analysts wrote in a note.


As the diplomatic crisis deepens, Europe has increased demand for shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas or LNG.


Williams Co. builds pipelines and other natgas infrastructure. Its projects include a pipeline to serve **Cheniere Energy**'s ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) Sabine Pass Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana. In addition, company pipelines and gathering facilities reportedly handle 30% of the natgas consumed in the U.S.


Natural gas prices fell 2.8% on Tuesday. But prices still remains elevated — futures closed up 46% last week as January contracts expired.

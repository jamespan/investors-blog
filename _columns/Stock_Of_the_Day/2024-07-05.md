Building Up Software Platform
-----------------------------


William Blair analyst Arjun Bhatia says Monday.com has evolved into a platform company from a project management software maker. While Monday.com's software is most often used in project management, it's also used for customer relationship management, automating workflows, human resources, marketing and other business purposes.


"Increasingly, we are seeing investors recognize Monday for its breadth and true platform potential, which puts it in a unique breed of software companies," he said in a recent report. "The first product Monday built on top of its platform was project management, which is still over 90% of the company's annual recurring revenue."


"More recently, it has launched Monday CRM (customer relationship management) and Monday Dev, and will be launching Monday Service later this year," Bhatia went on to say. "We expect more products to be built on top of the platform in the future, which we believe can be done relatively easily and with few R&D resources."


In 2017, the software maker rebranded itself to Monday.com from its former name, Dapulse. Monday.com raised $574 million in its June 2021 initial public offering, with Monday stock priced at 155.

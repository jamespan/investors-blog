**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the cloud computing leader remains in the buy zone despite a turbulent stock market. Microsoft stock did undercut key support level on Wednesday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), shares of the Dow Jones tech giant fell 3.3% to 133.98. Microsoft stock is still in the [5% chase zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) after its June 7 breakout from a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 131.47. That comes as many other leading stocks have seen their breakouts falter or fail.


But MSFT stock couldn't hold a key technical level as the [broader market turned south](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-yield-curve-china-economy/). Microsoft stock fell below its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) Wednesday after closing above that line for six straight days.


Microsoft still has a market cap above $1 trillion, the only company currently above that level.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for MSFT stock has been trending higher for more than a year, signaling steady outperfomance vs. the S&P 500 index. Microsoft stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks over the past 12 months.

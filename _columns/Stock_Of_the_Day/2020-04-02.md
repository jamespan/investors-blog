**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), a maker of high-speed data movement interconnects, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker is approaching a buy point despite a rough market. Inphi stock on Thursday tested a key support level.




Inphi's products are critical for moving large amounts of digital information quickly between and within data centers. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is benefiting from the growth of video streaming, social media and cloud-based services.


Inphi has continued to post sales and earnings increases during the [semiconductor industry downturn](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-companies-semiconductor-industry/), which started in late 2018, because it plays in some major growth markets.


Inphi stock ranks fourth in IBD's fabless chipmaker group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-inphi-corp-iphi.aspx) tool. It is tied with **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) with an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 98% of stocks in key fundamental and technical metrics over the past 12 months.

Inphi Stock Showing Strong Relative Strength
--------------------------------------------


On Jan. 7, Inphi stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 76.95. It hit an all-time high of 93.58 on Feb. 5 following [better-than-expected fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-inphi-earnings-q4-2019-iphi-stock/).


After tanking during the[coronavirus stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), Inphi stock has formed a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a buy point of 93.68, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Inphi surged 2.3% to 79.49.


In a bullish sign, the relative strength line of Inphi stock is hitting new highs, an indication the stock is outperforming the overall market. Inphi stock on Thursday found support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/).


Buying stocks is risky during a market correction. Investors should wait for a confirmed uptrend. Check out [IBD's The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) for the current market direction.


However, market downturns are a good time to assemble [watchlists of quality stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-prepare-watch-list-new-leaders/). Stocks holding up well during a tough market often outperform once the market goes back to a confirmed uptrend.



Called One Of 'Best Positioned' Chip Stocks
-------------------------------------------


In a report last week, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur called Inphi one of the "best positioned" semiconductor stocks in the current market. He rates Inphi stock as overweight.


"The data-center end market continues to exhibit strong growth driven by a technology upgrade cycle and increased capex spend on data-center build-outs," Sur said.

**Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) is the IBD Stock of the Day after racing past a buy point on a massive Q2 sales surge. Ollie's Bargain Outlet stock had already flashed a separate buying signal.




The closeout retailer, which is now an [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), has seen strong demand during the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers looking for bargains and getting a boost after the government issued stimulus checks.


Late Tuesday, Ollie's Bargain Outlet released preliminary Q2 results, showing comparable store sales growth of approximately 40%. Full results are due Aug. 27.


Management also expects to post total net sales of approximately $515 million in Q2, which ends Aug. 1. That's well above consensus estimates for $384.5 million.


Gross margin is seen at approximately 39%, a return to historical second quarter levels. Operating margin is seen coming in at approximately 16%.


However, management warned the robust comparable store sales growth has decelerated in recent weeks. The company said it's now tracking in the positive mid-teens, adding thatÂ  it should continue to moderate in Q3 and Q4.


"Looking ahead, we remain very well positioned to benefit from the continued disruption in the marketplace," CEO John Swygert said in a news release. "Deal flow is strong and while we can't control the continued uncertainties related to the impact of Covid-19 or the associated economic stimulus, we will keep doing what we do best; buy cheap and sell cheap, while maintaining discipline in how we operate our business."


Ollie's currently operates 366 stores in 25 states, and didn't have to shut down as it was deemed an essential retailer. It offers a wide variety of of brand name merchandise at heavily discounted prices.

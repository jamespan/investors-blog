**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Accelerating sales growth and a profit recovery for the fast-casual chain have fueled a big rally this year in Chipotle stock, which is nearing a new buy point.




Meanwhile, other restaurant stocks are performing well, with **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) moving into a buy zone and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) just below a possible entry.


Credit Suisse initiated several restaurants at outperform Tuesday, including Chipotle, Shake Shack and McDonald's. It gave Chipotle stock an 870 price target.


Chipotle Stock Makes 70% Gain
-----------------------------


Chipotle stock rose 1.3% to 733.22 in the [stock market today,](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) closer to a 749.35 [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) Shares are up 70% so far this year.


Chipotle has been consolidating for a few months, though the pattern has been somewhat messy. Still, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which compares a stock's performance against the S&P 500, has held near record highs after a strong run in the first quarter. The RS line actually bottomed in early October, as Chipotle stock outperformed during the sharp market correction.

Chipotle Earnings Strong, Sales Growth Accelerates
--------------------------------------------------


The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of Chipotle stock is a strong 93 out of a best-possible 99, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) stands at a so-so 63. But over the last three quarters, Chipotle earnings growth has come in at 62%, 28% and 60%.


Sales growth has accelerated over the past four quarters, with 14% in the first quarter.


Chipotle Stock Recovery 'For Real'
----------------------------------


The gains for Chipotle arrive after a years-long effort to patch up its reputation, shake up its leadership and improve its food-safety procedures in the wake of foodborne-illness scares that began in 2015.


The company has said its "For Real" marketing campaign — which emphasizes real, fresh ingredients — has resonated with consumers. Efforts to tweak the menu, modernize restaurants, and incorporate digital orders and delivery have also helped.


This spring, however, investors occasionally drifted toward the exits. In April, the company said it [received a new subpoena](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q1-2019-chipotle-stock/) related to illnesses linked to some of its restaurants. In May, Chipotle stock took another hit after BMO Capital Markets downgraded the stock to underperform and cut its price target.


BMO said Chipotle had "the greatest pork exposure" of the companies it followed, leaving it vulnerable to a rise in pork prices due to the African Swine Fever in China. The disease has wiped out large portions of China's pig population.


Chipotle stock has bounced back since early June.


McDonald's Stock, Shake Shack Stock
-----------------------------------


Investors should look for top stocks in leading groups, so it's a good sign for Chipotle stock that other restaurants are acting well.


Shake Shack rose 0.1% to 66.80 on Tuesday. Shake Shack stock rose as high as 69 intraday, briefly, pushing back above a 67.12 buy point from an 11-month cup-with-handle. Sales growth, which has remained solidly in the double digits over the years, has accelerated over the past two quarters. Revenue jumped 34% in the first quarter. Shake Shack stock has a strong 93 Composite Rating.


Shake Shack earnings are expected to fall 20% in 2019, but then rebound 26% next year.


Meanwhile, McDonald's, up 0.9% to 205.71 on Tuesday, is in a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) with a 206.49 entry. Three-weeks-tight patterns offer a chance for existing holders to add a few more shares.


Keep in mind that McDonald's stock, like many steady big caps, often forms tight patterns.


McDonald's stock has a so-so 71 Composite Rating. But it's risen steadily since February.

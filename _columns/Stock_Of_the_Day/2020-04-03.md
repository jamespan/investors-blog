**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the drug giant reaffirmed its 2020 guidance. LLY stock briefly cleared an early entry Friday as it closed in on a conventional buy point.




Last month, Lilly said it doesn't expect the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) to weigh on its financial guidance. Further, the pharma giant said it's taking the steps necessary to maintain its global supply of medicines. As a result, LLY stock has trended up in recent weeks.


In the same announcement, [Lilly delayed](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-provides-update-clinical-trial-activities-during-covid-19) most new clinical studies and paused enrollment for ongoing tests. Barclays analyst Carter Gould noted the development timeline for a key diabetes drug was unchanged.


"Taken together, the updates should help keep our Lilly thesis intact, and we continue to believe it should outperform pharma peers," Gould said in a report. He kept his overweight rating and 160 price target on LLY stock.

LLY Stock Is Consolidating
--------------------------


Eli Lilly stock is now consolidating with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 147.97. As of Friday's close, shares were about 5.6% below that entry. Investors could also consider 144.10 as an early entry. In early action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), LLY stock briefly topped that aggressive entry, but ended the regular session down 1.8% to 139.66.


Although Thursday was a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) — confirming the new stock market rally — stocks are pulling back now.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Eli Lilly stock is at its best levels since 2004. The RS line reflects a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Importantly, LLY stock tops its industry group of diversified medical companies. The group includes heavyweights like [**Johnson & Johnson**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/) ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Roche** ([RHHBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHHBY)) and [**Abbott Laboratories**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abt-stock-buy-now/) ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)). It ranks a powerful No. 14 out of 197 industry groups Investor's Business Daily tracks.



On a year-to-date basis, LLY stock has climbed roughly 6.3%. Meanwhile, diversified medical stocks have collectively fallen nearly 6%, as of Friday's close. The [coronavirus correction](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) weighed on the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) in late February and March.


Pharma Company Delays Studies
-----------------------------


Eli Lilly Chief Medical Officer Tim Garnett noted the Covid-19 pandemic has placed a massive burden on the health care system.


"At the same time, Lilly recognizes that for patients already enrolled in clinical (studies), discontinuation would disrupt their treatment and potentially diminish the societal value of the research information to which they are contributing," he said in a written statement.


So, Eli Lilly is continuing several studies on a case-by-case basis. Importantly, the timeline for tirzepatide remains intact, Barclays' Gould said. Lilly is studying the drug in patients with diabetes, obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.


But the pharma company delayed the development of a drug called mirikizumab in patients with ulcerative colitis, Gould said. This "removes a likely positive 2020 catalyst." But the drug isn't a huge contributor to the narrative surrounding LLY stock, he said.


"The absence of language around any disruption in (diabetes treatment) Trulicity supply in Europe or impact to sales, or slippage in tirzepatide Phase 3 readouts is otherwise encouraging relative to expectations," he said.


Similarly, UBS analyst Navin Jacob noted the delay for ulcerative colitis data should have a minimal impact on LLY stock. He has a buy rating and 157 price target on LLY stock.


Representatives of Lilly didn't immediately return a request for comment.


Analysts Bullish On LLY Stock
-----------------------------


Analysts remain relative bullish on Lilly heading deeper into 2020.


For the first quarter, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Lilly to earn $1.50 per share, minus some items, on $5.49 billion in sales. On a year-over-year basis, earnings would rise nearly 13%. Sales would increase almost 8%.


In 2020, Wall Street expects adjusted Lilly earnings of $6.77 per share on $24.09 billion in sales, up more than 12% and roughly 8%, respectively.


Notably, LLY stock has a perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99. This puts LLY stock in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95. So, LLY stock outranks 95% of stocks in terms of 12-month performance.

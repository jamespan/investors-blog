Shipping-container company **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). ZIM stock briefly broke out of a base Wednesday, though it backed off intraday highs.




The setup for the stock follows a spike in ocean-freight shipping prices this year, as the supply-chain crunch leaves businesses paying a premium to secure shipping containers. With Zim earnings booming, the shipping giant is offering fat dividends.


ZIM Stock
---------


Shares fell 3% to 56.18  in the [stock market today.](https://investors.com/stock-market-today) Intraday, ZIM stock hit 61.50, briefly breaking out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 60.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). The negative reversal wasn't encouraging. ZIM stock is up for the week.


The Israel-based shipping company began trading in January. Shares have run steadily higher since.


ZIM stock has a strong 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 84. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has moved higher, indicating outperformance vs. the S&P 500.



The stock has an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) of A. Its [Accumulation / Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of B+ indicates more buying than selling by institutional investors.


The company in November raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, citing "extremely positive container liner market fundamentals." Its most recent round of quarterly earnings, reported at that time, also beat expectations.


'Significant' Returns
---------------------


The company also said that this month it would be paying a $2.50 per-share interim dividend for the third quarter. More returns seem likely.


"Based on our expectation to distribute 30%-50% of 2021 net income, we are poised to return significant capital to shareholders in 2022," the company said in November.


ZIM stock analysts expect the company to put up a per-share profit of $36.80 this year. That's a roughly sevenfold increase from a year ago. Earnings are expected to tumble in 2022, but remain far above pre-2021 levels.


The company charters most of its ships, rather than owning them. It has also bulked up on its supply of shipping containers. Zim Integrated in November said it contracted to buy $898 million of equipment this year, adding around 307,000 20-foot equivalent units — a measure of shipping-container volume — to its container fleet.


Rising e-commerce demand, Covid-related disruptions at ports and factories, and limited staffing have converged on the world's supply chain, backing up shipyards and warehouses and straining freight networks on land and sea. Prices to ship goods, particularly on the water, have surged as a result.


Zim, during its earnings call in November, said it expected those pressures to continue, even as freight rates start to ease.


"Looking at the demand expectations in the U.S., pressure on the supply chain into the U.S. is not expected to decrease in the near term," CFO Xavier Destriau said.


Along with ZIM stock, **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) rose 3% on Wednesday, closing just below its 50-day line. **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) dipped 0.5% to 23.46, and was in a cup base with a 26.10 buy point.

**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the software giant rebounds from the recent tech stock sell-off. Microsoft stock is nearing a buy point.

Desktop Software Group Is A Laggard
-----------------------------------


Microsoft stock ranks second out of seven stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-corp-msft.aspx). It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 74 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


The desktop software group ranks No. 159 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks. Growth stock investors generally should focus on leading stocks in the top 40 industry groups.


The biggest drag on Microsoft's Composite Rating is its subpar stock performance of late. It has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 41 out of 99. That puts it in the bottom half of stocks for performance over the past 12 months.


Also, Microsoft has an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D-, indicating institutional selling of MSFT stock recently.


Microsoft Stock On Two IBD Watchlists
-------------------------------------


On March 9, investment bank [Goldman Sachs added Microsoft to its "conviction list"](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-shows-resilience-market-upheaval-security-concerns/) of recommended stocks.


Microsoft is "well positioned to capitalize on digital transformation spending, which we believe will outpace overall IT (information technology) budgets for the foreseeable future," Goldman analysts said in a note to clients.Â Microsoft has a strong presence in cloud computing, with applications, platforms and infrastructure offerings, Goldman said.


The next major catalyst for Microsoft stock could be the company's March-quarter earnings report, due in late April. Wall Street expects the Redmond, Wash.-based company to earn $1.77 a share, up 26% year over year, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts are forecasting sales of $41.03 billion, up 17%.


Microsoft stock is on IBD's prestigious [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist. It also is in the [IBD Long-Term Leaders Portfolio](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).

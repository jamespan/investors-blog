**On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The Roger Federer-backed parent company behind Swiss shoemaker On Running has battled back, trading right around a buy point after sinking on fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. ONON stock advanced Thursday.




On March 12, On Running reported a quarterly loss of 6 cents per share, falling from earnings of 2 cents the year prior. The FactSet consensus expected 500% earnings growth to 12 cents per share. Revenue growth slowed for the fourth consecutive quarter, increasing about 28% to $509 million. However, sales came up short of estimates of $516.8 million.


The results marked On Running's first loss after two quarters of more than 200% growth. The company's Q4 gross profit margin improved to 60.4% from 58.5%.


On Running said it expects to achieve net sales growth rate of 30% to 2.25 billion Swiss francs ($2.57 billion) in 2024, driven by strong demand for the brand and its product pipeline. For the first quarter, On Running sees direct-to-consumer net sales growing 26% to 495 million Swiss francs ($564.8 million), which accounted for "the lapsing of a strong wholesale quarter in the first quarter of 2023."


On March 12, following earnings, shares of ONON sank nearly 9%, falling below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. However, On Holding stock gained it nearly all back the following trading day and has now advanced around 17% since March 12.

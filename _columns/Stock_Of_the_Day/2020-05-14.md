**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as shares of the social media giant have rebounded sharply from lows in March and are positioning for a potential buy.




Shares have soared about 48% since hitting a 15-month low of 137.10 on March 18, as coronavirus concerns battered stocks broadly.


Since then, Facebook stock has run up quickly without much of a breather.


On April 30, shares jumped more than 5% on [first-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-ad-outlook-quarterly-earnings-could-hit/) that slightly missed on earnings and barely topped revenue expectations. Part of the pop in Facebook stock that followed was due to its 10% boost in monthly active users from the year-ago period, to 2.6 billion. Daily active users vaulted 11% to 1.73 billion.

That topped expectations and showed that stay-at-home consumers were actively engaging the platform.


Facebook Pulls 2020 Guidance
----------------------------


However, the company pulled guidance for the second quarter and full year due to uncertainties over the coronavirus impact.


Facebook gave an [update on Covid-19's impact](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-down-ad-sales-drop-in-areas-hit-by-coronavirus/) on March 25. It revealed a weakening in its ad business in countries taking aggressive actions against the virus.


The company said use of its products has skyrocketed due to coronavirus effects. Yet it warned that the increased user activity wouldn't shield it from the online-advertising pullback. Still, analysts appeared to look beyond those concerns as earnings reports from other companies highly dependent on advertising suggested their fears might not lead to results as bad as once thought.


Facebook stock currently has a 224.30 cup-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but it could have a handle in a few days on a daily and weekly chart. That would offer a slightly lower entry point of 215.38. Shares  rose fractionally Thursday to close at 206.81.


Analyzing Facebook Stock Performance
------------------------------------


Facebook has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of a best possible 99. The rating means Facebook stock currently outperforms 98% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


The stock also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 86. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


Further, the stock earns an EPS Rating of 96, meaning its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth is outpacing 99% of all stocks.


Also significant, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is floating at recording highs. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Facebook holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in IBD's Internet-Content Group. It's followed by **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), then Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). The group ranks 39 out of 172 industry groups tracked by IBD.


For its first quarter, Facebook reported an adjusted profit of $1.71 per share, double that of the year-ago period. Revenue climbed 18% to $17.737 billion, decelerating from 25% revenue growth in the prior quarter but maintaining a string of double-digit growth going back years.


Challenges With Advertising Performance
---------------------------------------


Among its challenges, Facebook has a large base of small- to medium-size businesses that advertise on its site. But these businesses have experienced significant closures and layoffs.


"Our conversations with industry contacts suggest digital media spending remains under significant pressure," Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a recent report to clients. He added that, "while the second quarter likely marks a bottom, ad budgets are unlikely to recover meaningfully until closer to the seasonally important fourth quarter."


On May 3, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a buy rating on Facebook stock, with a price target of 250.


"We believe many underestimated the resilience of digital ad platforms during a crisis, particularly Facebook, Google, **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN))," Thill wrote in a note to clients.


"What was consistent across these earnings reports is that during a downturn advertisers spend most on platforms with best-in-class measurement and highly engaged audiences," Thill added. "We believe these platforms will be best positioned to continue gaining share."

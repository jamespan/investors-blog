**Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the health insurer stands out among stocks bucking the market sell-off. Not only is Centene stock holding up, but investors could soon get a new buying opportunity for this medical sector name.




Centene Stock Action
--------------------


As the S&P 500 index tries to seeks support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/), Centene stock is holding above its 50-day as it trades in a tight range. The health insurance stock is shaping a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 148.34 buy point. Shares fell 0.9% to 142.70 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The new buying opportunity comes after the Stock Of The Day ran up more than 30% from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) breakout in April.


Centene's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is near record highs after a strong rally.


But with the market under growing pressure, investors should be cautious about making new buys.

This Medical Sector Group Bucks Sell-Off

Industry giant **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) has been trading tightly but recently hit a new high before forming a proper base. **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) is working on the right side of a cup pattern going back to late January. Cigna stock sold off hard in March after announcing plans to buy pharmacy benefit manager **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)).


UnitedHealth stock was off 0.1%. Cigna stock retreated 1.3%.

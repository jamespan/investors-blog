Setup Looks Bright For AMAT Stock
---------------------------------


"The setup looks bright for AMAT" because of continued growth in spending on wafer fabrication equipment, Sankar said in a note to clients. Applied Materials is well positioned as chipmakers invest in semiconductor capital equipment to support new factories amid widespread chip shortages, he said.


"We believe product momentum should help AMAT ride the waves of memory and foundry/logic (chip) spending," Sankar said.


Applied Materials supplies equipment to major chipmakers including foundries **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and Samsung.

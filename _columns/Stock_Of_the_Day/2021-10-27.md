Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the internet search leader shows resilience amid woes at other large-cap technology stocks. Google stock broke out Wednesday as shares surged amid its September-quarter earnings beat.




GOOGL stock on Wednesday rebounded off its 50-day moving average. With the move, it offers an early [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 2,873.35 — 10 cents above last week's high. Google stock also blew past its official flat base entry point of 2,925.17 but retreated back below it by the market close. Shares ended the day up 5% to 2,924.35.


While some FANG (**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))) stocks struggle in 2021, Google stock has now gained 66%.


"GOOGL stock has clearly been the most liked, best owned, and least debated megacap internet name, as reflected in its 60% share appreciation year to date," JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a report to clients. "As a result, the bar for GOOGL going into earnings this quarter was higher than for others."


GOOGL stock late Tuesday reported September-quarter earnings and revenue that handily beat analyst estimates. While internet search advertising revenue came in above expectations, YouTube and cloud computing sales were light.

Google Stock: Less Apple Impact
-------------------------------


"Alphabet reported enviable Q3 results, managing to sidestep the digital ad pitfalls experienced by leading social media platforms this earnings season," Brian White, analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., said in his note to clients.


**Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) [changes to consumer data privacy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-plunges-as-digital-advertising-ecosystem-takes-hit-from-apple-supply-chain-issues/) impacted Google's advertising business less than **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and Facebook.


Google earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, jumped 71% to $27.99 per share, including gains on equity investments. Gross revenue rose 41% to $65.12 billion.


Analysts had estimated Google earnings of $23.73 per share on gross revenue of $63.5 billion.


The company said net revenue, minus traffic acquisition costs, came in at $53.63 billion vs. estimates of $52.07 billion. Traffic acquisition costs jumped 40% to $11.49 billion.


Internet search and other revenue rose 44% to $37.93 billion vs. estimates of $36.41 billion.


Cloud Computing Revenue Growth Slows
------------------------------------


Google said cloud-computing revenue rose 45% to $4.99 billion vs. estimates of $5.17 billion. Despite the revenue miss, Google cloud cut its operating loss almost in half to $644 million.


YouTube advertising revenue rose 43% to $7.2 billion. Analysts had estimated YouTube ad revenue of $7.42 billion.


"Despite a few blemishes, Google overall (posted) a strong Q3, which looked even better vs. online media peer misses," Bank of America analyst Justin Post said in a note.


Parent Alphabet repurchased $12.6 billion of GOOGL stock in the quarter — about the same as in the second quarter. Google stock, though, could face tough year-over-year comparisons in the December quarter, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson said in a note.


"The multiple is on the richer side and some tougher comps are coming up, but given the especially attractive Covid rebound exposure, ever-rising YouTube engagement and monetization, and Google Cloud's march toward profitability, we see solid reasons to own the name," Erickson said.


Meanwhile, Google's Relative Strength Rating is 86 out of a best possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.


Google Stock: Institutional Ownership
-------------------------------------


However, institutional ownership has weakened.


Google stock owns an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of only D. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


GOOGL stock holds an IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of a best possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-inc-cl-a-googl.aspx).

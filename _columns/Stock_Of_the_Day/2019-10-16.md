**GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the recent IPO forms a new base while also potentially offering a separate entry for aggressive investors. Rival **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) also cleared a buy point.




GSX Techedu is the third-largest K-12 large-class, after-school tutoring service provider in China, and offers primary- and secondary-grade courses. It uses an online live large-class format to deliver its offerings.


The stock went public June 6, and is now comfortably clear of the initial offering price of 10.50. It is one of a host of China stocks in the education sector, which also includes names like **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), **Tarena International** ([TEDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEDU)) and **OneSmart International Education** ([ONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONE)).


GSX Stock Analysis
------------------


Shares closed up 0.6% at 14.10 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The IPO stock is forming a cup base [and is shooting for a buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 17.64. This is the second base since its IPO. Investor's Business Daily research shows such early-stage bases have a higher chance of success.


Among other China stocks in the sector, recent [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/new-oriental-education-china-stock-buy-point-rare-bullish-pattern/) New Oriental fell 2.2% to 113.74, back below a [115.98 buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [rare, and extremely bullish, ascending base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/aol-stock-market-investing-chart-base-pattern/). **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) rose 1.3% to 40.00, clearing a cup-base buy point of 39.76.


GSX stock is also just above its 50-day line. Institutional investors [often use the 50-day moving average as a reference point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). They step in to add shares to their positions when the stock pulls back to the key technical benchmark. A bounce above that level of support also can be a separate add-on opportunity for aggressive investors.


But the stock's relative strength line has been showing signs of weakness in recent sessions, and GSX stock has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 54. But this metric can be slightly misleading with IPO stocks as they have not had time to build a track record of success.



GSX stock's performance has been strong compared with other names in the IBD database. The [Stock Checkup Tool shows](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gsx-techedu-inc-cl-a-ads-gsx.aspx) it has a Relative Strength Rating of 97, meaning it is in the top 3% of stocks in this metric.


Big money also seems to see an opportunity with the IPO stock, as it currently has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-.](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Accumulation%2fDistribution+(Acc%2fDis)+Rating&termid=1) But while sentiment is rising, as of the most recent reporting quarter just 11.35% of shares were held by institutional shareholders.

Analyst Sees Tailwinds For China Stocks
---------------------------------------


Morgan Stanley analyst Sheng Zhong believes there is a path to a $160 billion market in online after-school tutoring in China. The launch of 5G networks, government initiatives, and a rush to consolidate the market all stand to benefit China stocks in the education sector such as GSX Techedu.


"We estimate that total hours spent on online K-12 tutoring in China will jump from 1.4 billion in 2018 to 22 billion in 2030, with online hours per user per week increasing to five, which is roughly half of the total average hours per week on K-12 tutoring (10 hours, online and offline)," Zhong said in a July 24 research paper. "This shows our expectation that close to half of academic tutoring will shift to online, while about half of extracurricular tutoring/training, which requires physical attendance (especially sports), will remain offline."


Another reason it could succeed is it uses the online merge offline, or OMO, model for providing its courses. This is the same model used by U.S. education technology such as Knewton and DreamBox.


"The key to sustainable success in AI education is to develop proprietary databases of and algorithms for learning behavior. We think that cannot be achieved only with pure online education platforms," Zhong said. "The main reason is that algorithms for learning behavior have higher requirements for data collection in terms of standardization, consistency and granularity, and must be rooted in observation of traditional offline education."

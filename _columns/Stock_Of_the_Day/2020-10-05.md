**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The construction equipment rental company is seeing renewed demand as home construction heats up amid the coronavirus pandemic. United Rentals stock broke out Monday.




Construction jobs were considered essential in many states even during the height of lockdown orders in March and April. Activity initially plunged but has rebounded strongly in the past several months. Homebuilders have been busy during Covid-19 as Americans rethink their living situations as more jobs allow work from home.


There was pent-up demand for houses pre-Covid, but the pandemic has seen a surge of urban apartment dwellers considering a move to the suburbs or rural areas as companies offer flexible work-from-home options. Low mortgage rates have also helped boost demand.


"We saw a steady recovery in volume beginning in mid-April, which gave us good momentum into the start of our busy season," CEO Matthew Flannery said in the second-quarter report. "While visibility is still limited, near-term indicators suggest that the second half of 2020 may track to seasonal patterns in the majority of our markets."

Earnings, Revenue Fall
----------------------


In July, United Rentals reported Q2 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations, though EPS fell 22% and revenue declined 15%. Based on past reporting schedules, United Rentals will report Q3 results later this month.


Analysts expect United Rentals earnings to decline 28% to $4.28 per share with revenue down 14% to $2.13 billion.


For the full year, United Rentals earnings are seen falling 24%, but then rebound 9% in 2021.


Investors should remember that construction is a cyclical business and that when demand drops, stocks can plunge. But strong demand can fuel big earnings gains.

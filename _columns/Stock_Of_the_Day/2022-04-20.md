**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day as the cybersecurity software company nears a buy point and displays healthy characteristics. FTNT stock recently formed a handle on its current first-stage consolidation.




Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., Fortinet's core business involves selling computer network "firewall" security appliances. Large enterprises and government organizations around the world use its technology.


In that market, Fortinet competes against **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and others. Firewall appliances protect computer networks by blocking online intrusions and monitoring web-based apps.


Fortinet provides cybersecurity systems and strategies to address the most critical security challenges. That includes networked, application, cloud or mobile environments that the company provides for more than 500,000 customers.


FTNT Stock: Resetting The Base Count
------------------------------------


After breaking out to a new high at the end of last year, Fortinet stock pulled back, [resetting its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in the prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).

The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) has remained above the 200-day line, a positive sign during this year's volatility in the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

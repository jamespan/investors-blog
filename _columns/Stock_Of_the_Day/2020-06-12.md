**Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the provider of cloud contact center software hugs its 10-week line after breaking out of a cup base in mid-April. Five9 stock would be in buy range if it tops Thursday's intraday high of 103.12.




Many companies are shifting away from internal contact centers that provide customer support. San Ramon, Calif.-based Five9's cloud software automates contact center services. In early June, Five9 introduced its newest website virtual assistant, which uses artificial intelligence tools to interact with consumers.


Five9 stock closed up a fraction Thursday amid a broad market sell-off. That's a bullish sign. On Friday, shares slipped 0.3% to close at 100.92.


Five9 owns a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96 out of a possible 99. The best stocks own ratings above 80.

An IBD weekly chart also shows Five9 stock broke out of a cup base with an 80.68 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in mid-April. Shares hit an all-time high of 108.91 on June 2, then pulled back.


Five9 Stock: 10-Week Line May Provide New Entry Point
-----------------------------------------------------


Five9 stock has been holding up well around its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), which could provide a new entry point. First it needs to retake the intraday high of 103.12 on Thursday. A stock can retest its 10-week line, or 50 day line, before becoming actionable.


Five9 competes with **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), startup Talkdesk and others. The corporate shift to work-from-home arrangements has impacted customer support, giving a boost to RingCentral stock as well as Five9.


Even before the coronavirus outbreak, many companies were shifting to cloud-based contact center software. But, the Covid-19 crisis has prompted more companies to explore a shift to cloud-based software, analysts say.


Five9 rents space in internet data centers to host its business communications software.


According to Five9, its clients can deploy new customer services agents in any geographic location. All the human agents need is a computer, headset and broadband connection.


Five9 Partners With Zoom Video, AT&T
------------------------------------


In May, Five9 announced a deal to partner with **Zoom Video Communication** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) in providing live agent support. It also announced a marketing deal with **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), which has been a partner of RingCentral.


The company name of Five9 stands for 99.999% service availability.


Five9 also automates call center services with website chatbots, or virtual assistants. Five9 in early June launched a new intelligent virtual assistant powered by privately-held Inference Solutions.


The company has also developed machine learning algorithms that help companies gather data on what questions or problems consumers bring up. One goal with AI is providing real-time assistance to customer service agents so they can solve problems quicker.


Five9 could not be reached for comment on whether it's ahead of rivals RingCentral and Twilio in using AI tools for contact center services.


Five9 on May 4 reported first quarter profit of 17 cents, up 6% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 28% to $95.1 million. The company maintained its full-year revenue outlook amid the coronavirus lockdown.


Five9 Stock: Shift To Cloud Underway Before Covid-19
----------------------------------------------------


Analysts estimate that June quarter earnings will fall 25% to 15 cents from a year earlier.


Terry Tillman, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, is upbeat on Five9 stock.


"We believe the shift from on-premise contact center agent technology to cloud contact center deployments will drive resilient top-line growth for Five9 regardless of the slope of economic recovery," he said in a June 4 report.


Further, Five9 stock holds an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of B-plus, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/).


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

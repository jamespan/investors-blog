**TFI International** ([TFII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFII)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The Canadian trucking company is in buy range after breaking a trendline.




Trucking has come into focus as supply chains remain under stress amid the pandemic. Established shipping routes have been altered as the types of products in demand change. While the supply-chain issue has weighed on consumers and some industries, it's helped lift trucking stocks.


IBD's Transportation-Truck group is ranked No. 46 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks. TFI International is a strong seventh in the group.


TFI International is based in Saint-Laurent, a borough of Montreal, Canada. It focuses on trucking logistics, truckload and less-than-truckload shipping. Less-than-truckload shipping is gaining in popularity as it allows multiple shipping companies to share space on trucks and can accommodate smaller loads.


TFI International serves customers in the United States, Canada and Mexico through its multiple subsidiaries.


But shipping between the U.S. and Canada has been impacted amid massive protests in Ottawa. Truckers have swarmed the capital to protest vaccine mandates and other pandemic restrictions.

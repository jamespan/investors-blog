HubSpot Stock: Earnings Due May 5
---------------------------------


Cambridge, Mass.-based earnings are due May 5 after the market close. To lower risk, one way to play HubSpot earnings might be to use an [options strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/stock-market-strategies-using-options-around-earnings-helps-minimize-risk/).


HubSpot sells sales and marketing software to small and midsize businesses. It focuses on digital channels such as blogs, internet search engines and social media.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wTechLeadersINDEX0402621.jpg)HubSpot aims to attract people to customer websites and optimize content so that visitors are converted into paying customers.


The software maker on April 20 rolled out [Operations Hub](https://ir.hubspot.com/news/hubspot-expands-its-crm-platform-with-the-launch-of-operations-hub), a set of tools aimed at information technology department operations teams that support "revenue generating functions," KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Michael Turits said in a report to clients.


He added: "The announcement seems to further management's strategy of bringing enterprise grade features down market while maintaining the simple user experience required by small- and medium-size businesses."


In the high end of the market, HubSpot competes against **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)).


HubSpot aims to attract people to customer websites and optimize content so that visitors are converted into paying customers. The company recently has expanded beyond marketing into sales automation and customer relationship management products, or CRM.


HubSpot Expands Ties To Amazon Web Services
-------------------------------------------


In the CRM market, HubSpot also competes with **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)).


Bank of America analyst Brad Sills recently initiated coverage with a buy rating. He pointed to HubSpot's "large installed base of over 103,000 customers and robust partner network of hundreds of digital marketing agencies" as well as a "large inbound sales organization."


"HubSpot is well positioned to continue gaining share in the vast SMB front-office applications industry," Sills said in his note to clients.


HubSpot has expanded its ties to Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). AWS is the biggest provider of cloud-computing services. HubSpot's marketing software has been hosted on AWS' cloud platform for several years.


Software Growth Stocks To Watch
-------------------------------


HubSpot's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 95 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD MarketSmith analysis. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.


In addition, HubSpot stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-plus. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. On an A+ to E scale, the rating measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. An A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


HubSpot is one of many s[oftware growth stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/saas-stocks-cloud-stocks/). Many have software-as-a-service business models.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) kicks off earnings on April 28. Guidance will be key for software growth stocks.


HubSpot's December quarter adjusted earnings were 45 cents a share, up 22% from the year-earlier period. Revenue climbed 29% to $186.2 million.


HubSpot recently acquired PieSync, which operates a customer data analytics platform. Terms were not disclosed.

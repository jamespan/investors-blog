**EQT** ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the natural gas and oil wholesaler reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. EQT stock blasted past a buy point to a two-year high.




The Pittsburgh-based company posted a 2-cents-a-share loss for the quarter, but that was 25 cents better than views. Revenue rose 49% to $922.3 million, swelled by recent acquisitions but $35.49 million above expectations.


EQT is a leading independent natural gas producer. It is the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachian Basin. Of the company's total proved reserves, 88% are located in the Marcellus Formation and 95% are natural gas.


Energy stocks have generally been on the upswing lately as demand for oil and gas picks up amid expectations for an economic recovery. Add in the fact that output was cut back for months following pandemic-related shutdowns, and it's no surprise that supplies are tight, thus lifting energy prices. Energy prices rose 5.1% in January, the biggest gain since a 9% rise in June.


Energy prices may also be rising due to the devastating winter storms slamming many parts of the country, especially Texas. The crisis exposes a major weak spot in the nation's electric grid to deal with the spike in demand related to severe weather events. Millions of people in Texas are without power in a deep freeze that's expected to last through the weekend. The disaster unfolding in Texas could prove to be a catalyst for the Biden Administration's green-energy plans, even as fossil fuel proponents are using it to make an argument against relying solely on new energy.

EQT Stock
---------


Shares jumped 7.3% to 19.17 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). EQT stock cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 18.76 on a long [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) and are in [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) to 19.70 according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The stock tried to break out in mid-January after running up from the lower part of a base. EQT stock fell back, but found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


EQT's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending upward, hitting a short-term peak and nearing a long-term high. The stock has an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 81. But its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is a dismal 4, as the company continues its steep climb back to profitability.


Among other energy stocks, **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) rose 1.6% and [**Chevron**](https://www.investors.com/research/chevron-stock-buy-now/) ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) 3%.


EQT Sales Rebound
-----------------


EQT's Q4 sales volume increased by about 28 billion cubic feet equivalent (BCFE) compared to the same quarter last year. The increase is due primarily to the added sales volume of 12 BCFE from the Appalachian Basin assets acquired from **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) during the fourth quarter of 2020, the company said in a statement.


The increase follows a slowdown in the months following the start of the pandemic and subsequent shutdowns in 2020. EQT said it made "strategic decisions to temporarily curtail production from May through November, which resulted in a decrease to sales volumes of approximately 46 BCFE."


EQT is also investing in automation to become a more efficient operator. Last month, it deployed a modern enterprise planning system. The system creates a standard data structure that aligns operations with the back office by eliminating manual processes.


President and CEO Toby Rice stated, "2020 was likely the most transformative year in EQT's history, one in which we turned vision into actions." Rice continued, "The extension of our digital evolution across the entire organization will bring greater governance, efficiency, and sustainability to our operational and financial performance as we move into 2021."

Target Earnings Growth Accelerates
----------------------------------


Target stock has an excellent [IBD Composite Rating of 94](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). It boasts a solid mix of fundamental and technical strength, the latter underlined by its Relative Strength Rating of 96.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-target-corporation-tgt.aspx) shows Target earnings have grown by an average of 22% over the past three quarters. However Target earnings has accelerated over that period, hitting the 25% growth mark in the previous quarter. This is far outpacing its three year growth rate of 7%.


Cracking The Amazon Code
------------------------


Target, along with a few other traditional retailers such as **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), are among those figuring out how to survive and thrive in the changing, increasingly digital shopping world. Target and its big-box peers are leveraging their stores to [offer in-store or curbside pickup](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/walmart-stock-dow-jones-giant-leads-retailers-winning-e-commerce-fight-amazon/), giving them an advantage over Amazon, which has a relatively light physical footprint.


With more than 1,800 stores throughout the country, Target boasts a big presence within major cities.



The strong economy has been helping Target stock. BMO analyst Kelly Bania in August said the firm stood to benefit from ongoing store closures among other retailers and a change in traffic patterns, particularly away from malls.


Among rival retail stocks, Walmart stock rose 0.8%, Costco stock 0.55% and Amazon stock 0.8%. Department store **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) climbed 2.5% and **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) 1.4%.


Target Aims For Christmas Bonanza
---------------------------------


Target is currently in the midst of the big holiday shopping season, and has taken steps to suck in even more greenbacks from customers. On Oct. 4, it launched the Disney store at Target in 25 Target locations, as well as online. This allows shoppers to buy items previously only available at **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) retail stores. And on Oct. 8, Target said it will power the website of Toys R Us, which is emerging from bankruptcy.


Analysts are keen on Target stock, with nine currently giving it a buy or outperform rating. No analysts rate Target stock as a sell. Raymond James began covering Target with a strong buy rating and a 130 price target.


Cowen recently named Target [a "best idea" for 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCM4_5uB1ww), maintained an outperform rating and boosted its price target to 150 from 145. Cowen cited the discount retailer's "high-quality value" offerings and said it expects continued "robust digital growth."

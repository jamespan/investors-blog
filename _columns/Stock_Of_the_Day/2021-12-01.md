On a good day for semiconductor equipment stocks, **Ultra Clean Holdings** ([UCTT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UCTT)) moved into buy range Wednesday and became the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). UCTT stock is also near its record high.

The stock is actionable because it's breaking the trend line in the handle. The official buy point is 60.94 from a handle entry on a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The buy zone extends to 63.99, after which it would be extended, making a buy of UCTT stock riskier.


Ultra Clean stock climbed 2.4% to close at 56.10 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

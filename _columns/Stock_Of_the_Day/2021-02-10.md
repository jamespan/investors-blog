Mobile app and advertising software maker **Digital Turbine** ([AAPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPS)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), bears watching for a climax top after a big run. While taking profits might be a good move near-term, AAPS stock may present some long-term opportunities as it expands from mobile into internet TV as well as internationally.




Digital Turbine connects wireless service providers, smartphone makers, and publishers with app developers and advertisers, according to an Oppenheimer report. The company operates a cloud-based app distribution platform and a curated content platform.


In a [climax top](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/), a growth stock is overheated and may be in the process of topping. This sell signal allows investors to lock in hard-fought gains on the upside, while the stock is still advancing.


During its recent run of AAPS stock, Digital Turbine shares popped 54% last week. They're up 8% this week already. Climax runs can start peaking at around 50%.

------------------------

Also, Digital Turbine stock is trading some 33% above its 10-day moving average. Some growth stocks reach 40% or 50% levels. But the rule of thumb on when to consider taking a profit is usually 20%.

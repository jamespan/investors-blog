**Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker stays near a buy zone following its recent breakout. MRVL stock wavered on Thursday.




On June 24, MRVL stock broke out of a 21-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 55.80, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.

**XPEL** ([XPEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the auto parts maker and distributor uses key acquisitions to capture growth in new segments. XPEL stock broke out past a buy point.




On May 25, XPEL announced it's acquiring PermaPlate, a distributor and installer of auto window films serving hundreds of dealerships. The company expects the $30 million purchase to add to revenue and earnings this year.


Many new **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) [owners use XPEL products](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-ppf-paint-protection-film-vs-ceramic-coating/) to lower the risk of exterior paint damage to their pricey new electric vehicles, for example. So do owners of Audi and McLaren supercars.


And last year, XPEL acquired Veloce Innovation, a provider of architectural films for use in residential, commercial, marine and industrial settings. It's looking to expand in the "key" architectural window film segment, the company said.

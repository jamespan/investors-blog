**Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). As the stock market rally comes under pressure, Ross Stores stock is retreating but not far from a [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), Off-price retailers with decent growth are seen as a defensive play.




The stock market has fallen as the coronavirus outbreak that began in China spreads to other nations, heightening global health concerns and investors' worries about the impact on the world's economy. However, shares of Ross Stores, while down today, have largely held up since its last earnings report in November.


Still, while the market is not yet in a correction, IBD's research would indicate that investors should tread lightly as the stock market rally comes under heavy pressure.


Ross Stores Stock
-----------------


For now, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) of Ross Stores' stock has climbed this month, moving above the high of its consolidation and nearing its October peak. That uptrend indicates it's outperforming the S&P 500. The benchmark index has fallen for the past four trading days.


Ross Stores stock is in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) with a 122.72 buy point. ROST stock briefly cleared that entry last week, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), rising to 124.16 on Feb. 20. But shares have pulled back in the market sell-off, declining 4% to 116.75 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) undercutting its 50-day line, Ross Stores stock has a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 89.


Ross Stores earnings and sales growth have accelerated slowly over the past three quarters. For the recently ended Q4, analysts project that Ross Stores earnings growth accelerated again, to 34%, though sales gains should cool to 6%. Ross Stores will report Q4 results on March 3.


In the current fiscal year, Ross Stores earnings growth is expected to slow to 8%.


Other bargain retailers, like **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) and **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), also have high ratings. Burlington Stores has 96 and 98 Composite and EPS ratings, and its relative strength line has rebounded this month. For TJX Cos., those ratings are 90 and 86, respectively.


TJX Cos. reports fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. TJX stock fell 3.3% to 59.72 on Tuesday, falling below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Burlington Stores lost 1.2% to 235.24, just below a 236.12 entry from a short consolidation.


'Volatile Retail Environment'
-----------------------------


As online retail keeps more people away from stores, off-price chains have still been able to draw bargain seekers to actual physical outlets. That in-store "treasure hunt" atmosphere — in which people come in without a specific purchase in mind but find a good deal anyway — is tougher to replicate online.


[Ross Stores' earnings for the third quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/tjx-earnings-q3-2019-tjx-stock-ross-stores-earnings/) topped expectations in November. The company cited better sales trends in its ladies' apparel, and strong demand in the Midwest, for the earnings beat. The children's segment also did well.


But Ross Stores noted then that it competes in a "volatile retail environment" characterized by ever-tougher consumer standards for value and convenience.


Still, Ross Stores' stock didn't move much. Management at that time also said it would stay cautious heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, noting the shorter calendar period between Thanksgiving and Christmas and broader economic uncertainties.

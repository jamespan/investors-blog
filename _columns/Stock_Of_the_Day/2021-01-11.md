**Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), provides a pioneering e-commerce platform where users go to sell a broad range of unique goods. Etsy stock has been on a big run since the great Covid-19 downfall for brick-and-mortar retailers that started in March of last year.




Now, Etsy stock is displaying chart activity that identities several buy points, based on the [CAN SLIM method of investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/). The method uses charts that can help identify buying opportunities and trend lines that show where a stock is getting support or finding resistance.


On Monday, Etsy displayed buy points having to do with the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and the lesser known [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) plots a stock's average closing price over the past 10 weeks. When another week of trading wraps up, a new 10-week average gets calculated. Hence, the average is "moving." [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and Investors.com charts draw the 10-week line in red.

Etsy Stock Bounces Off 10-Week Line
-----------------------------------


On Friday, Etsy bounced off its 10-week line, indicating a buy point of 167. However, unlike the traditional 5% range of a proper buy point using the CAN SLIM method, buying off the 10-week line expands the buy range from 5% to 10%. Hence, the Etsy stock buy range in this case would extend from 167 to 183.70.


On Monday, Etsy stock marched out of the buy zone for a time, based on the 10-week line. It then pared back gains and was within range. Shares ended the day up 4.2% to 183.04.


But with the 21-day moving average, the buy point is 174.65 and extends to 192.11, putting Etsy stock in buy range. Top stocks tend to find renewed demand at the 21-day line following a successful breakout.


This [IBD video](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/homestudy/mk-21-day-ma/) will provide additional clarification on the 21-day line.


Etsy Added to IBD SwingTrader
-----------------------------


Etsy was added to [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) on Monday, which presented a buy range of 182.65 to 187.22. It is also the No. 1-rated [IBD 50 growth stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full).


Etsy reported [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/etsy-stock-third-quarter-earnings-revenue-etsy/) on Oct. 28 that came in well above Wall Street estimates. It reported revenue of $451.1 million, smashing views of $412.7 million. Adjusted earnings came in at 70 cents per share, vs. estimates of 57 cents.


Etsy provides an [online e-commerce platform](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/etsy-stock-e-commerce-facemasks-earnings-etsy/) where creators of arts and crafts, vintage items and other unique goods go to sell their products.


The company held its [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/etsy-party-city-virtu-rise-ipo-market-recovery/) in April 2015, pricing Etsy stock at 16 and raising $267 million.


Strong IBD Composite Rating
---------------------------


The [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-etsy-inc-etsy.aspx) shows that Etsy has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99 out of a best-possible 99, meaning the stock currently tops 99% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. The best stocks will often rate 98 or 99 at the time they launch a big price run.


Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is 94. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the past 52 weeks measures up against that of all other stocks in IBD's database. The best stocks will often rate 90 or higher at the time they launch a big price run.


On Nov. 27, Etsy stock broke out from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), according to [Leaderboard analysis](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10).

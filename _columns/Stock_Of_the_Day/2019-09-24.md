**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the stock approaching a buy point as the social media company received a Wall Street upgrade on Tuesday.




Snap stock is forming a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) and getting closer to a buy point of 18.46. The stock was up during morning trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)., but the market downturn cast Snap shares down for an incremental loss at the close.


Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Tuesday upgraded Snap stock to buy, from neutral, with a price target of 22.


"Snap is well positioned to outperform our internet and media coverage universe through year end and provide an investor return of nearly 30% over the next 12 months," Morris wrote in a note to clients. "The combination of strong usage trends, industry-leading access to 18-34 year-old users and platform improvements should drive growth in advertiser demand."

He said long-term revenue potential at Snap is "the most underappreciated in our universe, which should support a sustained premium valuation multiple."


Based in Santa Monica, Calif., Snap is the owner of [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/). It's a smartphone app that uses the camera for manipulating and enhancing photos and videos that can be sent to other Snapchat users. The messaging platform is highly popular with the under-30 crowd and competes mostly with the Instagram platform of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


Snap Stock Jumps On Earnings
----------------------------


Snap stock jumped 19% on July 24 in reaction to its [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-earnings-revenue-beat-estimates-as-stock-jumps/) that beat Wall Street estimates.


Revenue of $388 million climbed 48% from the year-ago period and beat estimates of $359.5 million. It showed an adjusted loss of 6 cents, vs. estimates for a 10-cent loss. It lost 14 cents in the year-ago period.


Snap revenue continues to climb at a steady double-digit pace but the company remains unprofitable. Still, Wall Street is more focused on Snap's accelerating sales growth, which has gone from 36% to 39% to 48% over the past three quarters.


Snap ended the quarter with 203 million daily active users, up 8% from the year-ago period. That beat Wall Street estimates of 192 million.


The company scored big with its eye-catching IPO in 2017 that raised $3.4 billion and gave it a market valuation of $23.8 billion. That made [Snap the largest U.S.-listed IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) among tech companies since Facebook. But the party didn't last long as Snap stock plunged the following day and continued falling for months.


Under Assault From Facebook
---------------------------


Snap has been under constant assault from Facebook, which copied most of [Snapchat's best features](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-instagram-group-video-chat/) and added them to its Instagram Stories platform.


Snap stock plunged to a record low of 4.82 on Dec. 21, which is when investors began to take another look. Interest accelerated when [Snap reported fourth-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-earnings-stock-q4-2019/) on Feb. 6 that smashed estimates. Its first quarter results also came in better than expected, as the number of Snapchat users began growing again.


The company has spent much of the past year restructuring and developing new products for its Snapchat platform. Snap's primary focus is on growing its number of international users aged 13-34. The company also has stepped up efforts in augmented reality and improved its advertising business.


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows that Snap has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 80 out of 99, which would be higher if not for the company's bottom-line losses. Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is a best possible 99, which reflects strong [stock market performance](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near a record high, a good sign ahead of a possible breakout. The relative strength line compares a stock's price action with that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line means the stock is lagging.

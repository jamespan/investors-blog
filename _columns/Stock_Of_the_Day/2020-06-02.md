Chipmaker Beat March-Quarter Views
----------------------------------


During the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), Qorvo stock tumbled 45% before beginning its recovery in late March.


On May 7, the Greensboro, N.C.-based company delivered a [beat-and-raise March-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inphi-stock-jumps-beat-raise-quarterly-report/) amid strong demand for 5G infrastructure and handsets. It also got a lift from Wi-Fi 6, Internet of Things and its defense business.


Qorvo earned an adjusted $1.57 a share, up 29% year over year, on sales of $787.8 million, up 16%, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 28. Analysts predicted earnings of $1.33 a share on sales of $761.3 million.


For the current quarter, Qorvo estimated adjusted earnings of $1.13 a share on sales of $730 million. Wall Street had forecast earnings of $1.07 a share on sales of $707.8 million in the June quarter. In the same quarter last year, Qorvo earned $1.36 a share on sales of $776 million.


Cautious Guidance Amid Coronavirus Pandemic
-------------------------------------------


On a conference call with analysts, Qorvo Chief Executive Bob Bruggeworth gave a cautious outlook for the company's fiscal first quarter because of the Covid-19 pandemic.


"For the June quarter, the environment remains challenging and fluid," he said. "While constraints to global supply are limited, the impact of global demand remains unclear, given the uncertainty around the magnitude, duration, and geographic reach of Covid-19."



Qorvo's longer-term outlook is rosy, Bruggeworth says.


"We are confident, however, that the long-term secular drivers in our end markets remain compelling," he said. "Our technologies and operations are more important than ever, as we support global deployments in 5G handsets and infrastructure, along with defense, Wi-Fi 6, and IoT."

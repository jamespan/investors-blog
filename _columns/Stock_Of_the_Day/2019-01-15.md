HubSpot has a [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95 out of a possible 99. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. that of the S&P 500 index.


Another bullish indicator for HubSpot is institutional ownership. Big shareholders include Fidelity Investment's Magellan fund and Prime Capital's Odyssey fund.


HubSpot Targets Mid-Market And Startups
---------------------------------------


Jefferies analyst Samad Samana says HubSpot is well-positioned amid worries that the U.S. economy could weaken and even enter a recession by 2020.


"Should the macro environment turn, HubSpot is better positioned today to weather a storm than it was a couple of years ago," Samana said in a recent report to clients. "For one, more than 30% of the installed customer base uses multiple products. Given multi-product customers have a higher retention rate, we would expect churn (customer turnover) to tick up less than it would were HubSpot still a single product company."


HubSpot had more than 52,000 customers as of Sept. 30, up 40% from a year earlier. Many of HubSpot's customers have 10 to 50 employees, with some in the low hundreds. Analysts say HubSpot targets firms with up to 2,000 employees.


More than 40% of HubSpot's revenue is generated from multi-product customers. HubSpot in November reported third-quarter revenue growth of 35% to $131.8 million, topping analyst estimates by $5 million.


"Q3 results are another positive data point that HubSpot's positioning in the midmarket customer engagement category is strengthening," Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda said in his report. "The strength was broad based with 30%-plus growth displayed across billings, subscription billings, total revenue, subscription revenue, deferred revenue and customer growth, along with consistent margin improvement and solid cash flow."


HubSpot Expands Amazon Ties
---------------------------


HubSpot in December expanded its ties to Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). AWS is the biggest provider of cloud computing services. HubSpot's marketing software has been hosted on AWS' cloud platform for several years.


Under the expanded relationship, AWS will sponsor HubSpot's annual "Inbound" user conference. AWS will also provide discounts to startups that access HubSpot services via its cloud infrastructure.


HubSpot in December also announced a new $30 million venture fund targeting startups.


HubSpot stock popped 3.7% to close at 146.05 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). The digital marketing software maker has an entry point of 162.30.

**Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the discounting giant just begins to tap a Chinese market that could be a huge growth driver for years to come.




Signs were already positive for the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [SwingTrader](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=AURLEDW&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=Swing-Trader---US&campaignid=44057417&utm_content=ibd-swing-trader&adgroupid=5404101354&utm_keyword=ibd%20swing%20trader&matchtype=e&device=c&placement={placement}&network=o&creative={creative}&utm_name=trafficado&pdsch=1&msclkid=d3771ede3fa815a67304434958f877ae&utm_term=ibd%20swing%20trader) stock's first Chinese opening. So many shoppers mobbed the Shanghai location in August that the store had to shut down early on its first day for safety reasons.


Management said in its earnings call late Thursday that it has already seen record sign-ups of more than 200,000 memberships, fees from which provide a key source of income. This compares with a worldwide average of 68,000 for both a mature and a new club.


Meanwhile, sales have "remained very strong" since the Shanghai store opened, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said, adding that the next opening is planned for "early 2021." It will also be in Shanghai, in the area of Pudong.


"Clearly, (the opening) surpassed all of our very high expectations," Galenti said.


Costco is going to "be pretty methodical" as it capitalizes on Chinese demand for its stores, he noted.


Costco Earnings, U.S.-China Trade War
-------------------------------------


This bright spot overshadowed [mixed results for the discounting behemoth](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-earnings-q4-2019-due-costco-stock-in-buy-zone/). Earnings per share of $2.69 beat views, after excluding 22 cents per share in expenses related to a product tax assessment.


Revenue of $47.5 billion topped Zacks' estimates but fell short of some estimates. Similarly, same-store sales matched some forecasts but fell short of others.


One headwind is the impact of tariffs from the U.S.-China trade spat. Galenti said the firm continues "to be active in managing, and we're possibly mitigating the impact where we can."


The CFO added that the firm is "in a good position relative to retail overall," and he touted the firm's size and scale, as well as its relationships with vendors.

Analyst Cautious On Costco Stock
--------------------------------


Jefferies analyst Christopher Mandeville raised his price target to 260 from 222 after the fiscal Q4 results.


But he rates Costco stock as a hold, saying his caution is due to its current premium valuation, which he believes makes the risk/reward ratio unfavorable.


"Renewal rates have reached all-time highs and the COST brand is resonating with consumers domestically and abroad," he said in a Thursday research note. "Tariffs, however, are a risk and ongoing investments in facilities could dampen momentum."

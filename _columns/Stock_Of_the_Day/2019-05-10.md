Hot IPO stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day as it rallied more than 7% in heavy volume Friday and cleared a 73.04 buy point out of a cup base.




The March 16, 2018, IPO has made a nice run. The stock marked a new high April 1, before pulling back to shape the left side of its [current base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Though it looks like a flat base, it corrected as much as 18%. A flat base typically corrects no more than 15%, so Zscaler's current pattern would be considered a shallow cup. Shares jumped 7.2% to close at 73.55 Friday.


Zscaler rallied nearly 51% after a February [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a cup base to its April peak. Investors could have easily [taken some profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) on the way up. Those who bought at the breakout and didn't lock in gains on the way up, though, are still up more than 40% from the entry.


As a leading stock finds support in its first test of the 50-day line (or 10-week on a weekly chart), it could offer a chance to add or buy a smaller number of shares. Ideally you'd see strong volume on the rebound. But keep in mind that all buys are at greater risk with the market uptrend under pressure.

The San Jose, Calif.-based company's cloud platform allows customers to route data traffic to external data centers. Zscaler's cloud security platform helps protect thousands of customers from cyberattacks and data loss. It's used in more than 185 countries.


Zscaler Stock: Biggest Provider Of Cloud-Based Gateways
-------------------------------------------------------


Zscaler is the biggest provider of cloud-based web security gateways. It's No. 4 overall in the web security gateway market, says IDC.


The company gets most of its revenue from Zscaler Internet Access, its cloud-based replacement for on-premise web security gateways. Zscaler's cloud platform allows customers to route their data traffic to the external data centers where Zscaler houses its security software. The cybersecurity tools check data traffic for malware. Zscaler has installed cybersecurity tools in 100 data centers worldwide.


Expanding beyond the web security gateway market, the company has rolled out Zscaler Private Access. The new product accounts for about 10% of Zscaler's new customer contracts.


Zscaler Private Access targets business workloads deployed at cloud computing service providers. They include Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) or **Microsoft's** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Azure service.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) assigns Zscaler a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics into a single score. That puts it among the leaders in the 31-stock security software group. A 98 Relative Strength Rating is also among the group's best — it means Zscaler is beating 98% of all other stocks.


IPO Stock: Profits Ahead?
-------------------------


A 75 Earnings Per Share Rating reflects four years of losses. Analysts expect Zscaler will turn its first annual profit (of 12 cents a share) this fiscal year, which ends in July. They forecast a 42% increase to 17 cents in fiscal 2020.


An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B indicates more recent net buying than selling by mutual funds.


The security software group itself ranked No. 5 out of IBD's 197 industry groups as of Wednesday's close, up from No. 11 three weeks ago. Software remains at the top among the 33 sectors tracked by IBD. It's up more than 30% this year.

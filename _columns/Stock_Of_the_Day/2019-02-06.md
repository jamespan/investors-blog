**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the e-commerce platform provider gains in relative strength ahead of its earnings report on Feb. 12. Shopify stock briefly touched a buy point in intraday trading on Tuesday.




Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses, and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping. It also offers customer relationship management software so businesses can do targeted marketing for their clients.


The stock has a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95 out of a best-possible 99. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. A rising line points to outperformance.


Shares in Shopify have clawed back from a mid-December sell-off, when the Canada-based company announced its second equity capital offering within 12 months to raise cash.

CLOSE




Shopify stock edged up to close at 173.60 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). On Tuesday, the stock climbed to 176.88 in intraday trading before closing lower. Shopify has an entry point of 176.70.


Some analysts view Shopify as a takeover candidate.


Shopify A Match For Stripe?
---------------------------


"We believe the commerce platforms like Shopify, **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), and **Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX)) may consolidate with the merchant acquirers," MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis told Investor's Business Daily in an email.


She said privately held Stripe or **PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) loom as a buyer of Shopify or the other commerce platforms.


"Those businesses are highly complementary, and by merging can better help retailers — particularly small businesses — compete with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN))," she said.


Online payments company Stripe recently secured $100 million in venture capital funding at a company valuation of $22.5 billion. Stripe creates payment tools designed to help e-commerce companies and other clients conduct secure transactions.


Shopify reports earnings before the market open on Feb. 12. For the December quarter, analysts estimate Shopify will report earnings of 21 cents a share, up 33% from a year earlier. They predict revenue will surge 47% to $327.5 million.


Shopify Moves Into Film, TV Production
--------------------------------------


Aside from earnings and revenue growth, one financial metric key to Shopify's stock performance has been gross payments volume, or GPV. GPV is tied to customer growth and online transactions.


In the September quarter, GPV jumped 71%, up from 64% in the June quarter.


"Shopify gives investors exposure to multiple attractive investment themes — small- and medium-sized businesses moving online, secular growth of e-commerce, and larger merchants moving to the cloud," Jefferies analyst Samad Samana said in a report to clients.


Samana initiated coverage on Shopify in October with a hold rating.


"On the fundamental side, the year-over-year decline in net new monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and the slowdown in net new Shopify Plus customer adds concern us," he said.


Monthly fees for using the Shopify platform range from $29 for small entrepreneurs using the basic package, to $2,000 or more for Shopify Plus customers.


In January, Shopify surprised analysts by announcing a move into TV and film production. The company launched Shopify Studios, which aims to develop, finance and produce projects for networks and streaming platforms.

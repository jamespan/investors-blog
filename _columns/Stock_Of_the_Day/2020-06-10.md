AMD Stock Has Lagged Data-Center Peers
--------------------------------------


However, AMD stock has lagged other data-center chip stocks lately, including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)).


Santa Clara, Calif.-based Advanced Micro Devices makes central processing units, or CPUs, for personal computers and servers. It also makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, for PCs, gaming consoles and data centers.


On April 28, AMD matched Wall Street's earnings target for the [first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q1-2020-amd-stock/) and beat views on sales. But its guidance for the second quarter was lighter than analysts' estimates.


The chipmaker earned an adjusted 18 cents a share on sales of $1.79 billion in the March quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings jumped 200% while sales climbed 40%.


For the second quarter, AMD expects to generate sales of $1.85 billion, based on the midpoint of its outlook. It did not give a target for earnings per share. Wall Street had predicted AMD earnings of 21 cents a share on sales of $1.92 billion in the June quarter. In the year-earlier period, AMD earnings were 8 cents a share on sales of $1.53 billion.


Advanced Micro Devices Tied For First Place In Group
----------------------------------------------------


AMD stock has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx) tool now ranks AMD as tied for first among 30 stocks in the fabless semiconductor group. **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and Nvidia also share first place. IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group now ranks tenth out of 197 industry groups.


AMD stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94. That means it has outperformed 94% of stocks on the market over the past 12 months.

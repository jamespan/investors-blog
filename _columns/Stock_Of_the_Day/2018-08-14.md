Graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Nvidia stock climbed near buy territory on Tuesday after the company introduced its next-generation graphics processors based on its new Turing architecture.




Nvidia stock is approaching a 269.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) out of a nine-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/). It rose 2.1% to close at 261.43 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Nvidia is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday. Buying a stock ahead of earnings can be risky, but a [basic option trading strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-option-trading/) using call options can mitigate risk to about 3% around earnings or news events.


Analysts expect Nvidia to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $3.1 billion in its July quarter. That would translate to year-over-year increases of 80% in earnings per share and 39% in revenue.

It ranks No. 4 out of 35 stocks in [IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-corp-nvda.aspx). It trails **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)).


Nvidia's New Graphics Chip
--------------------------


Late Monday, Nvidia debuted its latest graphics chips at the Siggraph conference in Vancouver.


"Turing is Nvidia's most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade," Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a [keynote speech](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-reinvents-computer-graphics-with-turing-architecture) at the conference. The graphics processors are aimed at the $250 billion visual effects industry. They provide more powerful graphics rendering and computing capability than their predecessors.


Nvidia's initial products include the Quadro RTX 5000, 6000 and 8000 graphics processing units. They will be available in the fourth quarter. The Quadro RTX 5000 with 16 gigabytes of memory will cost $2,300. The 6000 model with 24 GB of memory costs $6,300. The 8000 model with 48 GB of memory has an estimated price of $10,000.


Turing is Nvidia's eighth-generation chip architecture and its biggest leap forward since the introduction of the Cuda chip in 2006, Huang said. Computer hardware and software firms backing the new processors include **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), Dell Technologies, **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)), **HP Inc.** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) and Lenovo.


Promises Of Realism
-------------------


Turing offers so-called ray-traced graphics for incredible realism, Huang said. The architecture also provides real-time interactive graphics, he said.


"This fundamentally changes how computer graphics will be done," Huang [told an audience](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/08/13/jensen-huang-siggraph-turing-quadro-rtx/) of more than 1,200 graphics professionals at the show. "It's a step change in realism."


RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said the new units could provide a lift to Nvidia's fourth-quarter results.


"We are positive on the technology specs provided by the company and believe the price points could lead to both revenue and gross margin upside in Q4 and beyond," he said in a report.

**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the diabetes treatment player rebounds into a new buy zone.




The rebound comes days ahead of the annual American Diabetes Association meeting, set to begin Friday. Shares of DXCM stock rebounded after pulling back to their [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). That puts DXCM stock in a [new buy area](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Analysts are bullish on DXCM stock. During the first quarter, Dexcom saw a record number of new patients start on its continuous glucose monitors, Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis said in a recent report following a conversation with Chief Executive Kevin Sayer.


The diabetes treatment company pulled its outlook for 2020 due to the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/). But that's likely a conservative measure, Lewis said.

"We had commented following the first quarter that 2020 guidance suspension was likely an abundance of caution, and Mr. Sayer expressed confidence that Covid-19 aside, Dexcom would have raised (its outlook)," he said.


DXCM Stock Enters New Buy Zone
------------------------------


Dexcom makes body-worn devices for diabetes treatment. These monitors measure the amount of glucose in a patient's blood. This is important for diabetics whose bodies don't properly regulate glucose. Spikes in glucose can be dangerous.


Awareness of continuous glucose monitors is on the rise, Lewis said. Previously, companies like Dexcom focused on patients with type 1 diabetes. This is a genetic illness in which the body can't make insulin, the regulatory hormone for glucose.


The use of continuous glucose monitoring is now expanding into patients with type 2 diabetes. This form of diabetes is progressive. According to Lewis, Sayer sees a future in which some type 2 diabetics could use these monitors for annual checkups.


"Even assuming a split market with ([**Abbott Laboratories**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abt-stock-buy-now/)' ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) rival device) Libre and a depressed $40 sensor price with no transmitter, this would imply an incremental $600 million in annual revenues," he said. He reiterated his equal weight rating on DXCM stock.


New Markets In Diabetes Treatment
---------------------------------


There are roughly 27 million people in the U.S. with non-intensively managed type 2 diabetes, Piper Sandler analyst Matt O'Brien said in a recent note. This is the "largest and most exciting new marketplace" for Dexcom.


He expects the diabetes treatment company to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for these patients in late 2021 or early 2022. The addition of these patients to Dexcom's customers could boost sales by $6 million in 2021 and $209 million by 2024, he said.


"Finally, with high prevalence of prediabetes being officially diagnosed type 2, the total addressable market could increase dramatically over time," O'Brien said. He has an overweight rating on DXCM stock, and raised his price target to 450 from 375.



O'Brien also sees opportunities for Dexcom's devices in hospitals and in treating gestational diabetes. During the coronavirus pandemic, some hospitals are using Dexcom's devices to track glucose for hospitalized patients with diabetes. This saves time and resources amid the pandemic.


There are roughly 14 million U.S. patients who could be eligible to use glucose monitors in hospitals. This would provide $17 million in revenue in 2022, increasing to $105 million by 2024, he said. The opportunity in gestational diabetes is smaller — $3 million in 2021, rising to $39 million by 2024.


DXCM Stock Is Highly Rated
--------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), DXCM [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) reversed earlier losses and ended the regular session up 1.1% to 368.62.


Shares of Dexcom have a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. The CR is a 1-99 score of a stock's key fundamental and technical growth metrics. This puts DXCM stock in the top 2% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Dexcom stock also has a bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97. This puts DXCM stock in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.


Representatives of Dexcom didn't immediately return a request for comment.

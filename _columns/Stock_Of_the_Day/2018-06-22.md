**Churchill Downs** ([CHDN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHDN)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it closes in on a buy point after forming a bullish [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/).




This [coveted formation can be powerful](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/base-on-base-breakout-yield-big-gains/), as it usually occurs among the strongest stocks during a market correction.


Horse racing giant Churchill Downs is most famous for operating the iconic Kentucky Derby, which is known as "the most exciting two minutes in sports." But it's a multistate company that operates racetracks, casinos and online wagering.


The [Supreme Court ruling to legalize sports betting](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/supreme-court-legalize-sports-betting-casinos/) in May has given Churchill Downs stock a boost. Indeed Churchill Downs was the first out of the gate in inking a deal to get in on the action in New Jersey, just days after the decision.

Shares rose 0.55% to 301.05 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The stock has now formed a 25-day, 5-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 314.70 entry, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).



This comes hot on the heels of [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), qualifying it as a bullish base-on-base pattern. However the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) remains near an all-time high.


Thoroughbred Fundamentals
-------------------------


The Kentucky Derby operator is leading the competitive Leisure-Gaming/Equipment industry group. It is trotting ahead of big hitters like **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)), **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) and **MGM Resorts International** ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)). It is also a few furlongs ahead of regional behemoths **Boyd Gaming** ([BYD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYD)) and **Penn National Gaming** ([PENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PENN)).


Las Vegas Sands is hovering around a buy point, while Wynn has sunk to its 200-day line and MGM Resorts is below its 50-day and 200-day averages. Boyd Gaming is just below an entry, while Penn National has been consolidating for several weeks.


Churchill Downs boasts strong fundamentals, which is reflected in its excellent [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 96. Other green lights included its [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/eps-rating) of 93, which reflects strong earnings per share growth, and its [Relative Price Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 91.


The [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-tools/accumulationslhdistribution-(accslhdistm)-rating) of B+ is also impressive, reflecting strong institutional investment. This is important, as institutions are the I in the CAN SLIM formula.

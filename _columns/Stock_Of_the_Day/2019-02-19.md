**Paylocity Holdings** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the provider of payroll and human capital management software nears a buy point. Solid sponsorship is a strong point for Paylocity stock.




Paylocity has delivered nine straight quarters of mid-20s revenue growth. That's the steady performance many institutional investors like.


Shareholders include Columbia Acorn, Wasatch Core Growth, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity OTC Portfolio. Steven Beauchamp has served as chief executive since 2007, another sign of stability.


"We continue to like Paylocity's consistent execution under the careful leadership of CEO Steven Beauchamp and believe the strategic value of this asset is illustrated by the recent acquisition of Ultimate Software," JMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens said in a report to clients.

Headquartered in Schaumburg, Ill., Paylocity stock has an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 88.57. Paylocity stock climbed 2.7% to close at 86.65 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Private Equity Eyes Payroll Sector
----------------------------------


Paylocity has formed a cup chart pattern over nearly six months. The base has a depth of 40%. That's a reason for caution. Bases with depths of more than 40% often are unable to meaningfully advance. But [sponsorship is growing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) and strong.


Private equity firms have also been eyeing the sector. An investor group led by Hellman & Friedman recently agreed to buy **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) for $11 billion. In addition, Apax Partners and others invested in Paycor, a provider of human resource and payroll software.


Like Paycom Software, which is an [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), Paylocity competes in part against service bureaus **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)) and **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)).


Paylocity has targeted the 20- to 1,000-employee segment of the payroll/human capital management market. But it has been hiring salespeople to go after bigger customers. That initiative may not help revenue growth until 2020, analysts say.


"On the unit side, the company had roughly 17,000 customers exiting fiscal 2018, but it can target some 600,000 midmarket companies, and its expansion into the SMB (small and midsize business market) provides a new source of potential unit growth," William Blair analyst Justin Furby said in his note to clients.

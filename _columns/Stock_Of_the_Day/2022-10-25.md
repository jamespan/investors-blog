**Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Wall Street expects the company to report an eye-popping 1,240% third-quarter earnings growth, and SWAV stock is now actionable.




The company is an expert in intravascular lithotripsy, a method of "cracking" hardened calcium in arteries. Patients with calcifications in their arteries are at a heightened risk of heart attack, stroke and death. Shockwave hopes intravascular lithotripsy will replace an older procedure known as atherectomy, which uses a small drill to remove the small, built-up plaque.


Chief Executive Douglas Godshall told Investor's Business Daily physicians were "thrilled" to find products as safe and predictable as Shockwave's. Atherectomy carries the risk that calcium chunks will break off into the bloodstream, causing problems. Intravascular lithotripsy cracks the calcium inside the vessel walls. That allows the vessels to relax and blood flow to normalize.


SWAV Stock Is Technically Actionable Now
----------------------------------------


SWAV stock is nearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 315 out of a consolidation, [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) data shows. But the stock is technically actionable now. Shares are breaking above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and the [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) in strong volume.


Further, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at a new high. Shares jumped 6% to close at 295.31 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Analysts are enthusiastic about the company's growth trajectory. When Shockwave reports earnings on Nov. 7, SWAV stock analysts project adjusted per-share profit of 67 cents and $124 million in sales. Earnings would grow 1,240% and sales would soar more than 90%.


That's on the way to expectations for full-year earnings of $2.55 per share and $475.9 million in sales. Earnings would turn around from a 26-cent loss in the prior year and sales would roughly double, according to FactSet.


Godshall credits the massive streak of growth to Food and Drug Administration approval of the company's intravascular lithotripsy device for patients with calcified coronary artery disease. The device, called C2, uses the same technology that breaks up kidney stones on calcified arteries.

SWAV stock has a nearly perfect [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98.

**Acadia Pharmaceuticals** ([ACAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACAD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as investors look ahead to a presentation of the biotech company's psychosis treatment.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Acadia [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) popped 6.2% to 45.24. Shares of the biotech company topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 44.20 out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). But volume was running only slightly above average. Volume should rise at least 40% on a breakout.


Next month during the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's disease meeting, Acadia will unveil the results of a Phase 3 study, dubbed Harmony. The biotech company tested a psychosis treatment known as pimavanserin in patients with dementia.


Pimavanserin already has approval in the U.S. to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. It sells under the [brand name Nuplazid](https://www.nuplazid.com/sites/nuplazid/files/pdf/NUPLAZID_Prescribing_Information.pdf). But the opportunity in dementia-related psychosis treatment is huge, RBC Capital Markets analyst Beau Miller said in a recent note to clients.

"Overall, we anticipate results will reinforce Nuplazid's clinical utility in dementia-related psychosis — highlighting its potential to be the first approved agent in this large indication — and emphasize its more tolerable and potentially safer profile vs. off-label therapies," he said.


Biotech Company Tests Psychosis Treatment
-----------------------------------------


On Monday, Acadia announced its plan to discuss the [results of its Harmony study](https://ir.acadia-pharm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/acadia-pharmaceuticals-host-investor-event-and-webcast-clinical?field_nir_news_date_value[min]=) on Dec. 4.


The biotech company estimates there are 8 million people in the U.S. living with dementia. Studies suggest 2.4 million of them, or roughly 30%, also experience psychosis.


Pimavanserin — the clinical name for Nuplazid — interferes with receptors thought to play a role in psychosis, schizophrenia, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders.


Nuplazid first gained FDA approval in 2016. Now, the biotech company is hoping to expand the drug to broader groups of patients. In addition to a psychosis treatment, Acadia is testing the medicine in patients with depression and schizophrenia.


Nuplazid Approved In Parkinson's Patients
-----------------------------------------


Nuplazid is currently only approved to treat hallucinations and delusions tied to Parkinson's disease psychosis. But some of those patients also suffer from dementia-related psychosis. In elderly patients, Nuplazid is associated with an increased risk of death, according to a "black box warning."


A black box warning is the strictest label the FDA can put on a drug.


Acadia stock holders will likely look for additional safety data at the CTAD meeting, RBC's Miller said.



"We believe investors will be looking toward CTAD to gauge potential doctor feedback once full data are available, as well as additional details on key secondary (study goals) and safety that could enable a differentiated label without a black box warning," he said.


Acadia Stock Pops On Dementia Opportunity
-----------------------------------------


Needham analyst Alan Carr expects the biotech company to expand Nuplazid to other patient groups.


"We see the stock as underappreciated given commercial opportunity in Parkinson's disease psychosis and dementia psychosis, and potential for expansion into depression and schizophrenia," he said in a recent report to clients.


On its third-quarter earnings conference call, Acadia management indicated its plan to add 400-500 salespeople, up from 150 representatives. The biotech company estimates 800,000 dementia-related psychosis patients are receiving off-label treatment with antipsychotics and antidepressants.


Carr expects Acadia to seek FDA approval in dementia-related psychosis treatment in mid-2020. He kept his buy rating and 60 price target on Acadia stock.


Acadia stock has an Investor's Business Daily [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 99, reflecting the stock's top-notch 12-month performance. This puts shares in the top 1% of all stocks regardless of industry group.

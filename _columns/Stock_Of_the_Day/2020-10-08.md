**Pool Corp**. ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the distributor of supplies for swimming pools begins a key season for upgrades. Pool stock, which just joined the S&P 500, topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




The pandemic has fueled home upgrades as people are largely stuck at home. Sprucing up yards, including pool installations, for small outdoor gatherings has been a popular option to maintain safety while socializing.

Fall is typically when pool owners plan renovations and upgrades. And perhaps for the same reason as in early spring, folks might be keeping their pools open longer regardless of chillier temperatures.

Pool Earnings
-------------


Pool is expected to release its latest quarterly earnings later this month. Buying just before a stock reports is risky, since disappointing numbers could send it sharply lower. You can reduce your exposure by waiting for results and how the market reacts.


Pool topped earnings estimates the last two quarters. For the last reported quarter, EPS rose 25% to $3.87, well above the Zacks consensus estimate of $3.09.


For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of 65 cents per share, but it delivered a 9.23% surprise of 71 cents.


Analysts see earnings growth of 17% for the quarter and 25% growth for the full year. EPS estimates for the full year were recently revised upward.


Pool CEO Peter Arvan said in a call with investors in September that Pool "managed to navigate through an unprecedented combination of events in our business this year."


He said as folks were told to stay home in early spring, they opened their pools sooner than usual in cooler weather. That fueled a need for heater repairs and cleaners, he added.

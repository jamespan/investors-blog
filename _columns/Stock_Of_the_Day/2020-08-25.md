**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the provider of cloud-based e-commerce software and services finds support at its 10-week moving average line. Shopify stock has shot up over 160% in 2020 as brick-and-mortar businesses pivot online amid Covid-19 lockdowns.




Canada-based Shopify enables merchants to build and manage their online businesses. While mainly focused on small- and medium-size merchants, its fast-growing premium Shopify Plus service targets big brands.


Shopify stock is well extended from traditional and alternate buy points. However, aggressive investors may look for an opportunity to take a small position.


On July 29, Shopify stock popped to an intraday all-time high of 1,107.92 after its June-quarter earnings blew past estimates. Shares pulled back, but still closed up nearly 7%.


Shopify did not provide September-quarter guidance, disappointing some analysts.

Meanwhile, in the dog days of August, trading volume in Shopify stock has dropped to less than half what it was in April and May.


Shopify Stock Tests 10-Week Line
--------------------------------


In early August, the e-commerce stock attempted to claw back to its all-time high, but fell short. Shopify stock now trades about 7% down from that high.


That's where the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) comes in. Many stellar stocks take a breather after a big run-up.


Shopify stock is now testing its 10-week line and investors could use it to add shares now.


In addition, amid the short consolidation following second-quarter earnings, Shopify is working on a new buy point of 1,108.02.



Shopify stock is now on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.


Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses, and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping. The e-commerce firm has stepped up business lending amid the coronavirus crisis.


Shopify Builds Up E-Commerce Alliances
--------------------------------------


Further, Shopify has forged a growing number of partnerships, including with **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), well-funded startup Stripe and others.


While Shopify might be viewed as a takeover target for the likes of Walmart, it has a governance structure that gives its founder and chief executive super voting rights.


In addition, Shopify is building a U.S. distribution network to store and ship products for its merchant customers. It plans to spend $1 billion over five years and, in the process, take on mighty **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Shopify recently raised $7.5 billion in a mixed registration offering.


The e-commerce platform provider holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). It has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99.


Shopify stock, meanwhile, has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Shopify rival **BigCommerce** ([BIGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIGC)) recently launched an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/bigcommerce-ipo-trading-day-initial-public-offering/).

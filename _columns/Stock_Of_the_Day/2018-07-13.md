**Integer Holdings** ([ITGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITGR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares broke out to a record high Friday, three weeks before the medtech player is set to report earnings.




Integer stock popped 7.5%, to close at 73.50, after touching a record high at 73.94, on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares broke out above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) at 68 of a flat base. The breakout came amid bullish views from Zacks Equity Research, which says Integer stock is stronger than **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) stock.


Integer Stock Vs. Abiomed Stock
-------------------------------


Zacks analysts have buy ratings on both Integer and Abiomed stocks. This is based on improving revisions to earnings expectations. Integer is an outsource manufacturer of medical devices. Abiomed makes heart devices.


The early Friday report also looked at forward [price-earnings ratios](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/price-slh-earnings--op-p-slh-e-cp--ratio-cma--current-and-relative-to-s-amp-p500). Integer's is lower at 20.40. This could signal the stock is undervalued or that the medtech firm is doing exceptionally well relative to past trends. Abiomed stock has a price-earnings ratio of 118.54.


In terms of earnings growth expectations, Integer also has a lower PEG (price/earnings to growth) ratio. This accounts for its expected annual earnings growth relative to the price-earnings ratio. At a ratio of 1.36, Integer appears less expensive than Abiomed, which has a ratio of 4.39.


Zacks also subtracted the companies' liabilities from assets, in an effort to compare their market prices to book value. In this price-to-book ratio, Integer again comes out on top with a ratio of 2.38 to Abiomed's 26.62.


"Integer holds a value grade of A, while Abiomed has a value grade of D," analysts wrote. "Both Integer and Abiomed are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that Integer is the superior value option right now."


Upcoming Earnings
-----------------


Investors are also likely bullish on Integer's upcoming second-quarter earnings release, set for early Aug. 2.


Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for adjusted profit of 86 cents per share on $382 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, earnings minus specific items are expected to grow nearly 39%. Sales would advance more than 5%.


Earnings could prove another catalyst for the 117-company Medical-Products industry group. IBD ranks the group second out of 197 groups tracked. The group has remained among the top three for the past eight weeks. Four weeks ago, it was ranked first.


In terms of market cap, **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)), **Stryker** ([SYK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYK)) and **Boston Scientific** ([BSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSX)) lead the group. Integer is among a list of 28 stocks in its group that have IBD [Composite Ratings](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of at least 90. Integer's CR of 94 puts it in the top 6% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and [technical stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/).

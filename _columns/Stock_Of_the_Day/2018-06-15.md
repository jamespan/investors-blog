**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The company provides cloud-based human capital management software. Paycom stock is right around a buy point.




Paycom shares fell 0.9% to close at 112.62 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The stock is still consolidating in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 118.55 entry point.


Paycom Stock Yellow Flags
-------------------------


Paycom is forming at third-stage base. Breakouts from later-stage bases can work, but are more prone to failure than rallies from a first- or second-stage formation. Also the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging slightly. The RS line could hit a new high if Paycom breaks out strongly.



Paycom Fundamentals Strong
--------------------------


Last month, Paycom reported a 56% jump in earnings and a 29% increase in revenue, both beating analyst expectations. Analysts expect EPS growth to accelerate to 88% in the current quarter.

Software Stocks Are Leaders
---------------------------


Human resources software stocks are doing well overall.


**Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) rose 1.6%, extended out of buy range from the 258.03 entry of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) added 0.5%, just extended after breaking out of a flat base. **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) dipped 0.1% consolidating in a double-bottom base.


The stocks are part of the Computer Software-Enterprise group, ranked No. 2 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.


But Paycom has outmatched rivals, expanding its direct sales strategy by adding regional offices. That has enabled the company to gain market share among small- and medium-size customers.

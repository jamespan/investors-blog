**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the wireless-chip maker benefits from expected smartphone sales growth this year. Qualcomm stock surged into a buy zone on Thursday.




In morning trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Qualcomm stock broke out of a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 161.17, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) extends up to 169.23.


By the close, however, [Qualcomm stock](https://www.investors.com/research/qualcomm-stock-buy-now/) slipped below that buy point and ended the trading session up 2.2% to 160.85. Investors could have started a position in Qualcomm stock in the past couple of weeks after it bounced off its [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), according to IBD analysis.


The San Diego, Calif.-based company has had an eventful 2021 so far.

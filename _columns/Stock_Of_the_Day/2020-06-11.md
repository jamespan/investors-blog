**Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the semiconductor test equipment maker benefits from resurgent spending in the chip sector. Teradyne stock is approaching a buy point.




Teradyne sells advanced testing equipment for semiconductors, wireless devices and electronic systems. It also makes [industrial automation equipment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/industrial-automation-boom-lifts-ter-stock/), including collaborative and mobile robots.


At the close on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Teradyne stock dropped 7.1% to 70.81, during the worst stock market rout since the coronavirus crash in March.


Over the past 20 weeks, Teradyne stock has formed a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 81.67, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


However, with its recent pullback, it could be forming a handle, which would offer a lower entry point of 78.29.


Aggressive investors also could have bought shares a couple of weeks ago after it cleared resistance at 67.64.


Teradyne stock hit a 20-year high of 81.57 on Jan. 23 after the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. During the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), it fell 47% to 42.87 on March 18 before beginning its recovery.

Teradyne Stock On IBD 50 List
-----------------------------


Teradyne stock got a lift in April from its [first-quarter earnings report](http://investors.teradyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/teradyne-reports-first-quarter-2020-results), which easily beat estimates.


The North Reading, Mass.-based company earned an adjusted $1 a share on sales of $704 million in the March quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Teradyne earnings rose 85% while sales climbed 43%. It was the company's third straight quarter of accelerating sales and earnings growth.


On June 2, Teradyne announced that it has begun volume shipping of its new [Magnum EPIC system](http://investors.teradyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/teradyne-begins-volume-shipping-magnum-epic-testing-leading-edge) for testing leading-edge memory technologies in 5G smartphones, data centers and other applications.


Teradyne stock ranks No. 47 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks. It is tied for first place out of 34 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. Teradyne and industry peer **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) each have a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-teradyne-inc-ter.aspx).


IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


In a sign of outperformance vs. the broader market, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Teradyne stock is carving new highs, and the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 91.

Record Semiconductor Equipment Spending Forecast
------------------------------------------------


The semiconductor equipment stock group ranks No. 35 out of [197 industry groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


On Tuesday, [industry trade group SEMI](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/semiconductor-fabs-to-log-record-spending-of-nearly-68-billion-in-2021-after-2020-lull-semi-reports-826698845.html) forecast that semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, would spend a record $67.7 billion on new capital equipment in 2021. Memory chip fabs will lead with $30 billion in spending, followed by logic and foundry with $29 billion in investments, it said.


The group forecasts rising equipment investments in the second half of 2020, but not enough to overcome slow spending in the first half. SEMI sees fab equipment spending falling 4% this year after an 8% drop in 2019.

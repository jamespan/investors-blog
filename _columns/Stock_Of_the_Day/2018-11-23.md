**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the fast casual chain continues to recover from food safety concerns and as other restaurant stocks such as **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) act well. In Friday's shortened [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) session, Chipotle stock rose a fraction.




Chipotle Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


Shares rose 16 cents to 471.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Chipotle stock is in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 501.08 buy point, finding support at its 50-day line this week.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is on the rise. The RS line is close to the consolidation high, even as Chipotle stock is still some 11% off that level.


The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 90, meaning Chipotle stock is outperforming 90% of all stocks in terms of overall fundamental and technical strength.


With a stock market correction back on, investors should be wary of making equity buys.



Chipotle Earnings
-----------------


Chipotle earnings shot up 62% per share for the third quarter. Revenue growth slightly accelerated for a second straight quarter, but overall sales and same-store sales slightly missed views. Investors were impressed, though, with the burrito maker's positive results from its "[For Real" marketing campaign](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q3-food-safety-incident/).


Chipotle stock has been rebounding for the past 10 months after the company struggled with numerous food-safety problems in recent years.


Going forward, management wants to improve its digital access for customer orders and its ability to process more orders to serve more customers.


CEO Brian Niccol took over earlier this year after helming Taco Bell, owned by **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)).


Restaurant Stocks
-----------------


While Chipotle is the IBD Stock of the Day, restaurant stocks have been outperforming despite the broader market sell-off. The Retail-Restaurant group is now ranked 34th out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, up from 67 just three weeks earlier.


McDonald's stock dipped 0.4% to 181.93. Shares are slightly extended from a 172.10 [saucer-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) entry.


Starbucks stock fell 1.6% to 65.70, still slightly extended from a 62.04 buy point. The coffee shop giant is the highest ranked stock in the Retail-Restaurants Group and is an [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/ScreenCenter/?start=ibd) stock.


**Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) shares slid 0.9% to 70.99. Dunkin' stock is consolidating in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) but is trading below its 50-day line.


Yum Brands stock rose 0.2% to 87.19. Yum also is in a flat base but below its 50-day line.

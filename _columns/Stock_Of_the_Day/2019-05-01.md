**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the China-based e-commerce giant has displayed an eye-catching cup-with-handle chart pattern of late.




Alibaba stock rose 2% to close at 189.31 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It cleared an initial buy point of 188.18, but stopped short of finishing above an alternate entry of 189.89 from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base. Volume was above average, but not on track for the 40%-50% minimum gain that investors should look for.


On April 10, Alibaba was added to the IBD [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) watch list of top stocks.


The cup with handle is a bullish chart pattern, and is a characteristic of the biggest stock market winners from the start of their rallies.

An example of that [comes from Alibaba](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), one of the top stocks of 2017. It surged more than 83% after breaking out of a cup-with-handle pattern in March of that year.


Alibaba's Cup-With-Handle Action
--------------------------------


In the current Alibaba cup-with-handle pattern, the low point is a 39% pullback. The desired pullback is 20%. But keep in mind that the S&P 500 pulled back 20% over that time, putting Alibaba's retreat into perspective. It's common for a growth stock to correct at least 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times that of the S&P 500.


Alibaba stock, like its peers, also was buffeted by the uncertainty [over the U.S.-China trade war](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/china-stocks-rally-trump-tariff-hikes/). China stocks have risen on comments that a deal is near, and fallen when hopes are deflated.


On April 12, Alibaba broke out past a 188.18 buy point, but volume was only average on the breakout. Shares soon pulled back below the entry, forming another handle.


Another flaw with that April 12 breakout attempt was the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high with or ahead of a stock breaking out. In Alibaba's case, the RS line wasn't even above the short-term handle high.


A lagging RS line is still a problem with the May 1 breakout attempt.


Alibaba holds the record as the largest-ever initial public offering for a technology company, pricing shares at 68. It's the largest e-commerce company in China and is also pushing into cloud-computing services. It also has a big play in groceries and multimedia services and increasingly focuses on brick-and-mortar retail. Key growth drivers for Alibaba include international expansion.


Alibaba Technical Analysis
--------------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-starbucks-corp-sbux.aspx) shows that Alibaba has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99, the highest possible. That means the stock currently tops 99% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.


It also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 84, which also reflects strong [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) performance.


The company ranks first among its peers in IBD's Retail/Internet industry group, followed by **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).


Its EPS Rating, which tracks quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth, is 86 and in this case is a caution flag.


Earnings growth has slowed in recent quarters, due to increased spending as Alibaba expands into new markets, such as cloud computing. But the company continues to deliver consistent double-digit sales growth per quarter going back more than four years. Investors should take note that quarterly sales growth has decelerated over the past three quarters, from 76% down to 34% in the latest report.


Quarterly Earnings Missed On Revenue
------------------------------------


In its latest reported quarter, Alibaba earnings per share increased 9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.78 a share. Sales rose 34% to $17.1 billion, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.


Alibaba earnings beat analyst estimates but it missed on revenue projections. Revenue from its core e-commerce operations rose 40% to $14.95 billion. Revenue at its cloud-computing business jumped 84% to $962 million.


Alibaba ended the quarter with 699 million mobile monthly active users, up 33 million from the prior quarter.


[Full-year earnings per share](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/) are expected to rise 10% this year and accelerate in 2020, up 22%.


Alibaba reports quarterly results on May 15, before the market open.

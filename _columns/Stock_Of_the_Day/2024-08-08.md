SharkNinja Stock Breaks Out
---------------------------


Investors ate up SN stock after the opening bell. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), SharkNinja stock rallied 17% to close at 85.36. In intraday trading, it notched a record high of 86.65.


With the move, SharkNinja stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) of 80.81, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. It also surged above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/).


However, most [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) during a stock market correction don't pan out. [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-rules-for-when-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-bull-and-bear-markets/) recommend that investors go with a smaller position or put the stock on their watchlists. Also, the stock is a bit extended because the buy zone goes to 84.85.


William Blair analyst Phillip Blee described SharkNinja's report as "another blowout quarter." He rates SharkNinja stock as outperform.


"SharkNinja continues to buck the trend of softening consumer demand in discretionary categories, led by the company's focus on newness and innovation, which has clearly resonated with an increasingly value-oriented and selective consumer," Blee said in a client note.


SharkNinja stock ranks first out of 13 stocks in IBD's Household-Appliances and Wares industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-sharkninja-sn.aspx). It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94 out of 99.

Carvana Stock Added To SwingTrader
----------------------------------


On Thursday, Carvana stock was added to [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/), as it moved above a downtrend and past resistance from the high of Nov. 6. It also moved above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) on Wednesday.


According to SwingTrader, the IBD buy zone ranges from 211.69 up to 218.04. However, be aware of [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) if it falters.



In addition, Carvana stock could be in the process of building the right side of a base, though without showing a specific pattern recognition at this time.


However, depending on how this scenario plays out it could lead to a future [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 242.25.


Carvana stock is up about 130% this year.


The internet has disrupted or destroyed businesses far and wide. And for a time, it left the century-old process of selling automobiles largely unscathed. Now, however, online car sales have begun to upend that process.


Auto buyers have never loved the sales process. Dealership salespeople hustling to upsell with add-on features, warranties, financing and insurance have left generations of car buyers exhausted and unsure if they got the best deal, consumer research says.


A Big Step Forward In Car Purchasing
------------------------------------


Carvana, **Vroom** ([VRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRM)) and others have moved this process a big step forward. Shoppers can browse thousands of pre-owned models and view detailed photos that provide a 360-degree view of cars, inside and out. They point out scratches or other defects to help consumers make a choice. Also nifty is that a newly bought vehicle is delivered to them, in some cases the very next day.


Carvana revenue has grown at double and triple-digit rates for the past three years. The company has yet to show a profit. Management says it's due to heavy investment, primarily in purchasing used cars to expand inventory. The company has also invested heavily in marketing in order to create a national brand.


It reported [third-quarter results](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/events/q3-2020-cvna-shareholder-letter.pdf) on Oct. 29.


Revenue jumped 41% from the year-ago period to $1.54 billion. It reported an adjusted loss of 10-cents per share, vs. a loss of 60 cents in the year-earlier period.


"We delivered another quarter of strong growth and crossed many financial milestones," said Ernie Garcia, founder and chief executive, in written remarks with the earnings news release.


Vehicle Sales Jumped 39%
------------------------


Carvana sold 64,414 vehicles in the quarter, up 39%.


It did not provide specific guidance, due to "uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 and its economic repercussions."


The [IBD Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-carvana-co-cl-a-cvna.aspx) shows that Carvana has a relatively weak [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 75 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Carvana stock currently outperforms 75% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria. Ideally, look for stocks with a Composite Rating of 80 or higher.


Carvana's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is a hearty 97. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the past 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


In addition, Carvana's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) recently hit record highs. it's still near highs but has pulled back of late.


The relative strength line compares the stock's daily price performance to the S&P 500. An upward-sloping RS line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. A downward-sloping line means the stock is lagging the S&P 500.

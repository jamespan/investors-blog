**Sunrun** ([RUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the leading provider of residential solar power recently broke into a buy range and is extending gains.




Sunrun is the largest residential solar, storage and energy services company in the U.S. The company provides solar energy to households with little to no upfront cost to those who lease their systems and at a savings vs. traditional electricity.

Sunrun also offers a home solar battery service, Sunrun Brightbox, which manages household solar energy, storage and utility power. Sunrun says it has more than 242,000 customers. It added 50,000 customers last year.


Solar stocks have held the top ranking among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD consistently for more than eight weeks. Sunrun currently holds the No. 3 ranking among its peers in IBD's Energy-Solar industry group in terms of Composite Rating.

Currently, the No. 1 company in the group is **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)), followed by **Jinko Solar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)), both based in China. Jinko Solar reports first-quarter results before the market open Friday.


Sunrun Stock: Sales Up 35%
--------------------------


Sunrun reported first-quarter results on May 8. Revenue rose 35% from the year-ago period to $194.5 million. It was the seventh quarter in a row of double-digit gains. Adjusted earnings showed a loss of 12 cents per share, down 148%.


The San Francisco-based company has logged four straight quarters of earnings declines on top of big revenue gains.


Analysts project that trend will turn in Sunrun's second quarter. Analysts call for a 133% earnings rise, but with revenue growth slowing to 17%, to $200 million.


Sunrun does not yet have a second-quarter announcement date. For the full year, analysts project a 157% gain in earnings. They see revenue growth at 11%.


Sunrun Stock Checkup
--------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows Sunrun has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 80 out of a best-possible 99. That means the stock ranks in the top 20% in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 96, which reflects strong [stock market performance](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Sunrun stock gained 1.2% to close at 18.60 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The stock has surged about 64% this year.


In the U.S. market, states have provided incentives for renewable energy expansion and higher corporate investments, which has increased solar panel installations.


California led the U.S. in installations over the last few years. However, Florida took the top spot in the first quarter.


Solar Installations On The Rise
-------------------------------


The Solar Energy Industries Association expects solar installations to increase 25% this year over last year.


Goldman Sachs upgraded Sunrun stock to buy from neutral last week and raised its price target to 20, from 15. Sunrun popped 7% that day, on June 18, breaking out above its buy point of 17.54, following a seven-week consolidation.


Shares on Thursday were slightly extended from the 5% buy range, which tops out at 18.42. Because the stock gapped up past the buy point, the buy range can be given a little bit of leeway.


Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee, in a note to clients, says U.S. residential solar stocks are poised to benefit from strong growth in the residential solar market. Near-term catalysts include a stable lending environment with upside from refinancing.


Credit Suisse analyst Michael Weinstein has a rating of outperform on Sunrun stock and a price target of 24.

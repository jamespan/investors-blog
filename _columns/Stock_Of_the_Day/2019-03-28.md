**Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Kirkland Lake stock has been a big winner, but a key part of investing is selling. Kirkland Gold stock undercut a key technical level Thursday and looks set to trigger a long-term sell signal.




Toronto-based [Kirkland Lake Gold outpaced gold-mining peers](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/gold-mining-stocks-gold-price-rally-kirkland-lake-gold/) over the last two years, largely on the back of its Fosterville operations in Australia. Gold prices have been choppy over the same period. Fosterville, a low-cost underground mine, has reported growing gold production at increasingly high grades.


But after a furious 40% rise from a mid-December breakout, Kirkland Lake stock has been in a profit-taking zone. An IBD Stock Of The Day column Jan. 30 flagged it as a [good time to take Kirkland Gold profits](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-top-growth-stock-sell-signal/).


While Kirkland Lake stock kept rising in February, it's retreated in March. Notably, shares on Thursday traded below their level back on Jan. 30.

Kirkland Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


Shares of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stalwart gapped down 6% to 30.76 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), undercutting the 50-day line in huge volume. A big break below that key marker of institutional support can mark the end of a huge run. For many smart investors, it's a [defensive sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). At the very least, consider taking partial profits in Kirkland Lake stock.


Kirkland Lake stock was well extended after its big run-up, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Most stocks pause to take a breather once they've run up about 20%. So a prudent rule of thumb is to [take profits when you're up 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) on most of your stocks.


If Kirkland Lake stock ends the week below the 10-week line in big weekly volume, that would be a strong long-term sell signal.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), tracking a stock's performance against the S&P 500, has been trending down this month.


Kirkland Lake Stock Has Great Fundamentals
------------------------------------------


As of Wednesday's close, Kirkland stock had an unbeatable [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99. Earnings were a key driver, with the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-woodward-inc-wwd.aspx) showing that it averaged EPS growth of 240% over the past three years. Earnings slowed to high double-digit growth over the last three quarters, coming in at a still-powerful 68% in the latest quarters.


Sales rose an average 72% over the last three years with growth accelerating for the past two quarters.


But stocks often top while fundamentals are excellent. A good rule of thumb: Buy stocks on fundamentals and technicals, but sell on technicals.


Gold Prices Fall, Dollar Rallies
--------------------------------


Gold prices, which have been volatile of late, fell Thursday as the dollar rallied. Global economic fears and overseas central banks turning dovish faster than the Federal Reserve are making the dollar look more attractive. Gold prices and the dollar tend to have an inverse relationship.


Like Kirkland Lake stock, SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), an ETF or exchange traded fund, undercut the 50-cut moving average. The GLD ETF fell 1.4%.

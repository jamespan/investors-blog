**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day as scientists grapple with a new variant that could undo Covid vaccines. In response, Pfizer stock broke definitively into a buy zone.




The [new variant](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vaccine-stocks-pop-as-scientists-grapple-with-a-terrifying-new-covid-variant/) called B.1.1.529 — or omicron — was first detected in South Africa. It contains what one scientist called a "constellation" of mutations. Roughly 30 of those are centered on the spike protein, the key marker currently authorized or approved vaccines use to induce an immune response.


**BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) says it needs two weeks to determine whether its Pfizer-partnered vaccine will be able to contend with the new variant.


On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), vaccine stocks popped. [Pfizer stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) jumped 6.1% to 54. BioNTech stock surged 14.2% to 348, and [**Moderna**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/) ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) stock rocketed 20.6% to 329.63. [**Novavax**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvax-stock-buy-now/) ([NVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVAX)), which has an authorized shot in Indonesia and the Philippines, soared 9% to 217.97.

Pfizer Stock Breaks Out
-----------------------


BioNTech is testing the new variant in its laboratory, spokeswoman Charlotte Spitz said in an email to Investor's Business Daily. It needs two weeks to run those test.


"The variant differs significantly from the ones observed previously as it has additional mutations in the spike protein," she said. After testing, "BioNTech will be able to determine whether B.1.1.529 could be an escape variant, which would require adjusting our vaccine if it spreads internationally."


Pfizer representatives didn't immediately return a request for comment.


But Pfizer stock broke out. Shares gapped above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 51.96 out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The stock initially broke out on Nov. 19, but couldn't hold onto its gain.


Variant Research Is Underway
----------------------------


Pfizer and BioNTech began preparing for troublesome variants several months ago. The companies already have test data for alpha- and delta-specific vaccines that they could submit to regulatory authorities as models data, Spitz said.


She estimated Pfizer and BioNTech would need six weeks to adjust their vaccine for the new variant and could ship initial batches within 100 days.



Representatives of Moderna didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Novavax spokeswoman Amy Speak says the company is already testing an omicron-specific vaccine. It will begin "testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks," she said in an email.


Merck Pill Less Effective
-------------------------


Investors in Pfizer stock also likely watched closely an update from [**Merck**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/merck-stock-buy-now/) ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) for its Covid treatment, a pill called molnupiravir, in development with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.


Merck said [molnupiravir cut the risk](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/merck-stock-dives-as-covid-pill-proves-less-effective-than-initially-thought/) of hospitalizations or death by 30% in a study of more than 1,400 unvaccinated, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate Covid. That's down from a 48% reduction in an interim analysis offered in October.


In comparison, Pfizer said its two-pill regimen reduced the likelihood of severe outcomes in at-risk Covid patients by 89%. Patients started Pfizer's pill within three days of symptoms beginning vs. five days for patients taking Merck's molnupiravir.


Bullishly, Pfizer stock has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99, [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital) shows. This puts shares in the leading 3% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical measures.

**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker continues to take market share in processors for personal computers and servers from rival **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). AMD stock broke out Thursday after recently notching a 13-year high.




AMD stock had formed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) last week with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 41.89, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. The chipmaker also is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) list of top stocks to watch as a half-size position.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMD stock broke out and jumped 7.9% to close at 42.59.


On Nov. 4, [AMD stock broke out](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-hits-buy-point-q3-earnings-report/) of a second-stage [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of 35.65. The action occurred just days after the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reassured investors with its [in-line third-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q3-2019-amd-stock/).

AMD Gains In CPUs As Intel Pulls Back
-------------------------------------


AMD has jumped ahead of Intel in making central processing units, or CPUs, at smaller node sizes. That's given its chips an edge in speed and performance. AMD is now making chips at 7-nanometer scale, while Intel has struggled to make chips at 10-nanometer scale. Circuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter.


On Dec. 3, while speaking at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan indicated that his company isn't going to focus on preserving market share in CPUs.


In his presentation, Swan said Intel missed out on opportunities in the semiconductor industry because it was fixated on maintaining its CPU leadership.


Swan said he is working to change the company's focus to pursuing 30% of the total semiconductor market, rather than 90% of the CPU market.


On Nov. 20, Intel published an [open letter to its customers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-reacts-pc-chip-shortages-reaffirmed-outlook/) where it apologized for not being able to meet demand for CPUs for personal computers.


AMD could reach 20% server share in about 12 to 18 months and eventually 30% share, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said in a report Tuesday. On the PC side, AMD could hit a sustainable share in the mid to high 20% range, he said. He rates AMD stock as outperform.


AMD Stock Ranks No. 8 In Fabless Chip Group
-------------------------------------------


AMD stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97. That means it has outperformed 97% of stocks over the past 12 months. Put another way, it is in the top 3% of stocks today.


However, AMD stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 88. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx) now ranks AMD as No. 8 out of 31 stocks in the fabless semiconductor group. So it has seven peers with better combined fundamentals and technicals right now. Top-performing stocks in the group include **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)).

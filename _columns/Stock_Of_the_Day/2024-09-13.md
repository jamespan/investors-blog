**Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the financial services company broke a downtrend, offering investors a buy opportunity. The stock has rallied 20% since hitting recent lows a month ago.




Greenwich, Conn.-based Interactive Brokers provides automated trade execution services as well as custody services for stocks, commodities and foreign exchange across several countries.


Interactive's customer base includes individuals, small businesses, money managers, family offices, hedge funds and others. Its product line features a zero-commission trading platform for U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs while active traders can access advanced features in IBKR Pro.


The company has offices in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, Hungary, India, Singapore, Australia and China. Billionaire Thomas Peterffy founded Interactive Brokers in 1993. He still chairs the company and owns a majority of the Interactive Brokers stock.


Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday that on Sept. 16 Interactive Brokers plans to allow users to bet on whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump will win the White House in November. Peterffy told the WSJ that IBKR expects to also allow betting on swing-state Senate races, but at a later date.


However, reports emerged Friday that the plan may be postponed after a federal appeals court gave the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a short delay to make its case that election betting platforms on U.S. financial markets should remain unlawful.


[Interactive Brokers' top competitors](https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-trading-app-for-the-young-pushes-into-retirement-accounts-with-incentive/) include **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)).


On July 16, Interactive Brokers topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, with profit growing 33%. Full-year EPS is expected to increase 20% to $6.89 this year, according to FactSet.


Interactive Brokers, and many other financial institutions, has benefited in recent years from high interest rates, as the Federal Reserve hiked rates to combat inflation.

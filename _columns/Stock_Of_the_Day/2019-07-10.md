Brazilian payments company **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The hot Brazilian payments stock, a 2018 IPO, gapped up to a record high Wednesday. But PagSeguro stock is flashing signals that it's time to take some profits.




The [IBD 50 member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) has soared since breaking out past a 31.74 buy point from either a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) or [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on May 24. Shares rose 4.2% to 42.98 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/), hitting a fresh high after eclipsing its March 2018 peak earlier this month.


PagSeguro Digital stock is up 129% so far in 2019, and it holds a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 99.


This would be a good time to either cut your position in half or, if nervous about the current behavior of the market, take full gains.

IBD Stock Of The Day Triggers Profit-Taking Rule
------------------------------------------------


Investors should remember that greed is not always good when it comes to the stock market. To grow your portfolio substantially, CAN SLIM connoisseurs prefer to [take most gains in the 20%-25% range](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/).


At Wednesday's intraday peak of 43.84, PagSeguro stock was 38% above the entry point.



Selling a stock when it is on the way up is the best way to lock in gains. When a stock is still advancing and looking strong there are plenty of buyers.


"The secret is to hop off the elevator on one of the floors on the way up and not ride it back down again," legendary investor William J. O'Neil, who founded IBD, says.


The reason investors are advised to take profits at 20% to 25% is that growth stocks tend to advance by this amount after breaking out of a proper base. After that, stocks often pull back. Sometimes they consolidate and set up new bases. Some of those resume their advances.


Other PagSeguro Stock Sell Signals
----------------------------------


PagSeguro stock is well-extended above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). When stocks get far above this moving average, they often pull back, at least in the short term. Also, Wednesday's gap-up move (the stock was already extended) suggests a short-term top.


Unless shareholders have strong conviction in PagSeguro stock, investors may want to sell half their position now and perhaps unload the rest if shares close below their 10-day moving average.


PagSeguro Stock Taps Fertile Market
-----------------------------------


Brazil-based PagSeguro Digital serves as a digital payments and sales transactions facilitator for small businesses. The company [built a niche by targeting smaller merchants](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/how-pagseguro-can-rule-this-sweet-spot-in-brazils-e-commerce-market/), giving it an edge over some rivals. It is tapping the Brazilian market, which analysts say is a big opportunity due to the underpenetration of credit cards.


PagSeguro, which provides online and mobile services, sells low-cost payment devices that enable micro-merchants to accept credit or debit cards rather than cash. Analysts estimate that three-fourths of the small businesses that buy PagSeguro's entry-level, mobile point-of-sale device did not accept card payments previously.


PagSeguro earnings growth has decelerated for six straight quarters, from 367% to 37%. Revenue growth also is cooling.


PagSeguro Digital Faces Big Rivals
----------------------------------


It is going up against much larger payment-processing companies owned by **Banco Bradesco** ([BBDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBDO)), **Banco do Brasil** ([BSBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSBR)), **Itau Unibanco** ([ITUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITUB)) and Banco Santander Brasil. These larger firms make up more than three quarters of the industry. Cielo, the largest payment processor, is controlled by Banco Bradesco and Banco do Brasil. PagSeguro is majority-owned by Universo Online, Brazil's largest internet portal.


Another Brazilian payments stock that has made a mark is **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)). Warren Buffett [is a big backer of StoneCo](https://www.investors.com/research/stoneco-stock-warren-buffett-stake-brazil-ipo-stock/), with **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) currently holding the second-largest stake in the company. Berkshire Hathaway holds 14.17 million shares, or 9.8% of StoneCo stock. The biggest holder of all is T. Rowe Price Associates, with a 22% stake. This is important, as canny [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) investors are always on the lookout for stocks with institutional support.


Brazilian Stocks Rally On Reform Hopes
--------------------------------------


PagSeguro, StoneCo stock, and other Brazilian stocks and ETFs have been rallying in recent weeks in part on an improving Brazilian political and economic climate. President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January with a pro-market agenda. His economy minister, Paulo Guedes, has promised to end years of failed state interventions in Latin America's largest economy. Bolsonaro aims to enact sweeping free-market reforms. Brazil's Congress is due to vote soon on pension reform.


But if pension and other reforms stall, Brazilian stocks could quickly reverse.

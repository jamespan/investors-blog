**Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the computer hardware giant improves its balance sheet through divestitures and shows strength in a rocky market for tech stocks. Dell stock is approaching a buy point after its solid first-quarter earnings report.




The Round Rock, Texas-based company on May 27 crushed Wall Street's targets for its [fiscal first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dell-stock-news-computer-maker-crushes-first-quarter-views/). Dell earned an adjusted $2.13 a share, up 59% year over year, on sales of $24.49 billion, up 12%, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts expected Dell earnings of $1.62 a share on sales of $23.35 billion.


Dell said its better-than-expected results were driven by growth in PCs, infrastructure solutions and its **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) business.


On April 14, [Dell announced plans to spin off its VMware business](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dell-stock-looks-to-shed-conglomerate-discount-with-divestitures/) to strengthen its balance sheet. Dell expects to receive about $9.3 billion to $9.7 billion from VMware as part of its agreement to divest its 80.6% stake in the virtualization software maker. Dell will use the proceeds to pare down its heavy debt load. It had about $38 billion in long-term debt at the end of the first quarter.


Dell also agreed to [sell its cloud business Boomi](https://investors.delltechnologies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/francisco-partners-and-tpg-acquire-boomi-dell-technologies) for $4 billion to Francisco Partners and TPG Capital. The parties announced the deal on May 2 and it's expected to close by the end of the year.


Dell Stock Has Formed A Flat Base
---------------------------------


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Dell stock rose 0.9% to 101.66.


Over the past seven weeks, Dell stock has formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 103.90, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. The buy point is 10 cents above the stock's all-time high of 103.80, reached on April 19.


Aggressive investors could have picked up shares earlier this week when it broke out of a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) and cleared a short downtrend.


In a positive sign, Dell stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) is pushing higher as it outperforms the S&P 500 index.


Dell stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 85% of stocks over the past 12 months.


Dell Ranks Fourth In PC Group
-----------------------------


Dell stock ranks fourth out of 11 stocks in IBD's computer hardware and peripherals industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dell-technologies-cl-c-dell.aspx). It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group. Three peripherals makers have higher Composite Ratings: **Cricut** ([CRCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRCT)), **Logitech** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI)) and **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)).


Dell has posted three straight quarters of accelerating revenue and earnings growth. Over the past year, the work-from-home shift amid the Covid-19 pandemic boosted sales for makers of PCs and peripherals.


Now, Dell is poised to profit from tech purchases as workers return to offices after getting vaccinated, Cowen analyst Krish Shankar said in a recent note to clients. However, he rates Dell stock as market perform, or neutral.


"We expect the return-to-office trend will continue to benefit Dell in the coming quarters, especially the ISG (Infrastructure Solutions Group) segment," Shankar said. Infrastructure solutions includes servers, storage and networking gear.


Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her overweight, or buy, rating on Dell stock after the company's earnings report. She also raised her price target on the stock to 130 from 127.


"The combination of accelerating ISG growth, VMware spin, and debt pay-down make Dell one of the best economic recovery plays," she said in a note to clients.

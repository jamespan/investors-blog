Huawei Contributed 14% Of Inphi's Sales Last Year
-------------------------------------------------


Inphi received 14% of its sales from Huawei in 2018, totaling more than $40 million, investment bank Needham said Monday. Sales to Huawei were expected to be flat this year before the U.S. ban on trade with the company, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said.


Inphi makes high-speed data interconnects for telecommunications networks and data centers. On [May 22](https://www.inphi.com/media-center/press-releases/inphi-corporation-announces-revision-to-q2-outlook-based-on-executive-order-issued-to-us-department-of-commerce/), it lowered its second-quarter outlook after the U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei and its affiliates to its Entity List.


Needham said the U.S. easing of trade restrictions with Huawei is only a temporary reprieve.


"We view this as a temporary development that could easily be reversed again if trade negotiations break down," the brokerage said Monday. "Accordingly, we are not putting Huawei revenue back into our earnings models at this juncture. Nonetheless, we view this is as good news."


No. 3 Ranking In Fabless Chip Group For Inphi Stock
---------------------------------------------------


Inphi stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-inphi-corp-iphi.aspx). Inphi stock ranks No. 3 out of 32 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) is first, but it's being acquired by **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) ranks No. 2 in the group.


IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group currently ranks No. 59 out of 197 industry groups. Three months ago, it was No. 7. Chip stocks have fallen in recent weeks over diminished prospects for a sector turnaround in late 2019.

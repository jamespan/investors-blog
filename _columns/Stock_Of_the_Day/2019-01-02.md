China's largest online music streaming service, **Tencent Music Entertainment Group** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-investing-in-ipos/), providing an opportunity to learn important lessons about investing in IPO stocks.







A spin-off of China tech giant **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), Tencent Music [began trading](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tencent-music-ipo-trades/) on Dec. 12. It priced 82 million American depositary receipts at $13, the low end of its estimated price range of $13 to $15 per share, raising $1.1 billion.


The stock rose 8% on its first day of trading. But it sank quickly amid weakness in the broad market. It hit a record low of 11.81 four days after the IPO, on its way to building a [first-stage IPO base](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-ipo-base/), with a buy point of 14.85. Tencent Music stock closed at 13, down 1.7%, on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


It's important to know that IPO stocks can be volatile, even those that launch a nice run from a first-time breakout. Trading IPO stocks requires following a [sound set of sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/). IPOs from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), for example, all headed south from their second week of trading, providing clear examples of why you should wait for a new IPO [to form its first base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-ipo-bases/) before you invest.

When To Buy IPO Stocks
----------------------


Learning time-proven rules on [when to buy IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), when to sell shares to maximize profits and minimize losses, and how to find the best stock ideas can help you stay in the winner's circle. If the pre-IPO buzz turns into a bust, you'll be glad you stayed out.


Tencent Music says it's the largest online music entertainment platform in China. The company was formed in mid-2016 after Tencent Holdings bought a controlling stake in China Music Corp. It then combined that with Tencent's streaming business. It operates the top four music mobile apps in terms of mobile monthly active users.


The selection of Tencent Music as the IBD Stock Of The Day is due in part to its strong growth in sales and earnings for a new issue. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tencent Music reported revenue of about $1.98 billion. That was up 84% from the year-ago period, with a profit of $394 million.


For its third quarter, Tencent Music reported adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share, up 100% from the year-ago period. That was the seventh quarter in a row of triple-digit gains. Revenue rose 65% to $722.2 million. Tencent Music has shown double- and triple-digit revenue growth over the past seven quarters. In the latest reported year, earnings increased 377% to 18 cents per share year over year.


Investors studying IPO bases are partly blinded because new issues don't have enough trading history to generate tools like the Relative Price Strength Rating or the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as compiled in IBD's proprietary research tool, [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). There are ways to [evaluate these blind spots](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), however.


Catching IPO Leaders
--------------------


When it comes to investing in IPOs, also check out IBD's [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) section, which aims to alert readers to promising companies that have recently gone public.


It was a mixed year for the IPO market, with new issues lagging the broad market and few stocks left on IBD's IPO Leaders screen by year's end.


Last year, 190 companies went public, 30 more than in 2017, and proceeds increased 32% to $47 billion, according to IPO research and investment firm Renaissance Capital. It was the third most active year in the past decade, behind 2013 and 2014.


Among high-profile IPOs expected this year are Uber and Lyft, the two leading providers of ride-sharing services.

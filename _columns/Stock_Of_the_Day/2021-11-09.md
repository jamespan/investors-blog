**MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)), Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is the rarest of the rare — a major miner of rare earth minerals in the U.S.




Demand for these key ingredients in components for EVs, wind turbines and other green-energy and high-tech pursuits has placed rare earth minerals among commodities with the fastest-growing prices. After strong earnings last week, Monday's infrastructure stock rally helped lift MP Materials stock above a buy point.


MP stock is part of the flagship [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/#) stock list.


'Strategic Asset' Of Enormous Consequence
-----------------------------------------


MP is short for Mountain Pass, the Las Vegas company's California mining complex, which CEO James Litinsky calls "an irreplaceable strategic asset of enormous and growing consequence — not only to America, but to the entire Western Hemisphere."


NdPr, or rare earth magnets, are critical for advanced technologies such as EVs, drones, defense systems and medical equipment. However, China plays a dominant role in mining and processing rare earth elements. The Mountain Pass site should make MP Materials the lowest-cost producer of rare earths in the world, according to its latest presentation.


Litinsky said on a Nov. 4 earnings call that China recently moved to consolidate six major rare earth producers into just two companies. "We believe this is very bullish for rare earth prices and, of course, highlights the increasing importance of MP's mission," he said.


In Q3, MP Materials reported a record profit as revenue grew 143% to $99.8 million. That reflected a 127% increase in materials prices, as well as a modest increase in production.


For MP Materials, 2022 will be a transition year. MP Materials currently ships its unseparated bulk concentrate to China for processing. But the company will begin to separate the rare earths it mines, offering potential for higher profits. By 2025, MP Materials is eyeing actual production of magnets.


MP Materials Stock
------------------


On Monday, MP Materials stock surged 13.9% to 41.69, clearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a 14-week cup base. On Tuesday, MP stock initially retreated before rebounding for a 2% gain to 42.54 in [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Aggressive investors could have used 38.68 as an early entry. That was 10 cents above the Oct. 25 high, which came before a quick downdraft on a short call from Grizzly Research. MP stock quickly regained its footing as MP rebutted the short trader's analysis.



MP stock went public in November 2020 through special-purpose acquisition company Fortress Value. Its all-time high of 51.77 came in early March.


MP stock's relative strength line, though off its March highs, is breaking out to a seven-month high. MP Materials stock has a strong 94 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a single rating combining both technical and fundamental factors.

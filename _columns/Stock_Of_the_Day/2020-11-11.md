**Oak Street Health** ([OSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSH)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Medicare-focused clinic operator bounced back from an earnings sell-off. Several analysts boosted their price target for OSH stock, an August IPO, citing strong results and a new Medicare program that will take effect in April 2021.




Oak Street Health Earnings And Outlook
--------------------------------------


Oak Street Health late Monday reported a third-quarter loss of 15 cents per share, a bit narrower than the 18-cent loss expected. Revenue grew 57% to $217.9 million, topping expectations by about $5 million.


Given the Q3 revenue beat, investors may not have been wowed by full-year guidance of $854 million to $858 million, which ran $4 million to $8 million ahead of prior estimates. Meanwhile, Oak Street expects a full-year adjusted EBITDA loss of $93 million to $99 million.


The new surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations may weigh on near-term results for Oak Street Health. The Chicago-based company says it has cut back on community events for attracting new patients. However, after halting new clinic openings as it learned to deal with the pandemic in the spring, Oak Street Health is back in expansion mode.


Oak Street expects to open six to eight stand-alone health clinics in the fourth quarter, after adding 16 in the first nine months of 2020. That doesn't include three pilot clinics inside **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) supercenters in Texas. Those pilot clinics are on track to open before year-end.


Oak Street Health Stock Analysis
--------------------------------



Oak Street Health stock bounced 4.1% to 51.57 in Wednesday [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). OSH stock had slumped 9.7% on Tuesday, following earnings, but found support at its 50-day moving average.


Oak Street Health stock is roughly 6% below a 55.01 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That's just above the Oct. 14 high.


Often, the initial breakout of an IPO can be explosive. Like many new IPOs, OSH stock breakout attempts have been short-lived. However, the overall market has gotten whipsawed since the start of September, and this could be one to watch. OSH stock looks a little better on a weekly chart.


Oak Street has a respectable 78 Relative Strength rating from IBD, meaning it has outperformed 78% of stocks. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has pulled back slightly from late September, meaning OSH stock has slightly lagged the S&P 500 over the past six weeks. But the RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, isn't too far off highs either.



Oak Street Health Business Model
--------------------------------


Oak Street Health clinics target Medicare patients. The company establishes clinics in high-density urban and suburban areas. It further focuses on areas with health care that is substandard and unnecessarily high-cost.


At the end of September, Oak Street Health clinics had 59,500 "at-risk" patients, meaning it gets fixed monthly per-patient fees from Medicare Advantage plans to treat them.


Oak Street also cared for an additional roughly 30,000 patients under traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Treating those traditional Medicare patients is much less attractive from a business economics perspective. Yet those economics are about to change in April under a new Medicare direct contracting program.


Medicare Direct Contracting 'Encouraging'
-----------------------------------------


"Through this program, Oak Street and other participants will contract directly with CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), in a similar fashion to how Oak Street currently contracts with MA (Medicare Advantage) plans," CEO Mike Pykosz said on the Q3 earnings call.


"We are very excited that this program allows us to capture risk-based economics similar to what we receive on our Medicare Advantage patients on our traditional Medicare patients, allowing us to benefit financially from the investment we are making in our patient care."


Pykosz said Oak Street began enrolling traditional Medicare recipients in the program last month.


SVB Leerink analyst Stephen Tanal highlighted the Medicare direct contracting outlook as "especially encouraging." He hiked his OSH stock price target to 78 from 55, keeping an outperform rating.


Walmart Partnership
-------------------


While Oak Street's foot in the door with Walmart offers great potential for expansion, the medical stock is downplaying that for now.


CFO Tim Cook noted that the clinics inside Walmart will be about one-third the size of its stand-alone health centers. The pilot will provide insight into how well the economics work for Oak Street and "how aggressively we want to expand that partnership or not, candidly."


Even before further expansion, Oak Street has lots of room for the growth. The company's 67 stand-alone centers can handle three times as many patients as it currently treats.

**Guess** ([GES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GES)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The millennial-focused apparel chain attempted a breakout thursday as investors cheer Guess earnings and ongoing turnaround.


Guess Earnings Send Stock To Four-Year High
-------------------------------------------







Guess earnings grew nearly 90% to 36 cents a share on 12.5% revenue growth to $646 million. The results were mixed — analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were looking for 36 cents in per-share earnings and $651 million in sales — but investors seemed pretty happy with the quarter.


Shares of the retailer rose 5.6% to 24.23 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Guess stock hit 26.95 intraday, the highest point since August 2014 and briefly cleared a 26.25 buy point. Volume was very heavy.


Guess stock is up more than 50% so far this calendar year.


The quarter was "strong across essentially all fronts, with an acceleration in the Americas, and ongoing strength in Europe and Asia," wrote Jefferies analyst Janine Stichter in a Thursday note to clients. "Investments are tempering the level of EPS upside for now, but the path to a 7.5% op margin (earnings power of ~$1.75) is now very clear, with all segments on track for profitability" in fiscal 2019.

The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is still off the consolidation's peak. Ideally the RS line will hit a new high along with or ahead of the stock itself.


Part of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, Guess stock ranks 18th. (**Boot Barn Holdings** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) is No. 1.) With a Composite Rating of 75, it doesn't boast the strongest rating, but that still puts it ahead of 75% of other publicly traded companies by a mix of technical and fundamental factors.


Guess Turnaround Continues
--------------------------


The retailer is about [three years into its turnaround](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2015/07/01/the-fall-of-guess-jeans-and-the-marciano-brothers/#5441cb8d1469), since the appointment of Victor Herrero as CEO in 2015, replacing co-founder and then-chief Paul Marciano. ([Marciano stepped down as chairman](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/guess-chairman-paul-marciano-resigns-after-probe-into-improper-conduct.html) in February following an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations from Kate Upton and others.)


Cowen analyst John Kernan raised his price target to 25 from 23, noting the continuing turnaround, and said he is "encouraged by the brand's new messaging, marketing and in-store execution."


"We continue to see management implement a new culture inside the company along with improved merchandising, new innovative marketing and improved execution and merchandising inside its owned retail stores — led by Herrero's new vision for the company," he wrote Thursday.


Retail Sector Earnings Still Relatively Strong
----------------------------------------------


Collectively, retailers started off this earnings season strong, though results have been choppier this week, with **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) [missing on revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/abercrombie-earnings-sales-q2-results-retail-stocks/), **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) topping views but turning in weak guidance, and Calvin Klein parent **PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)) also [beating views but offering a light outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/calvin-klein-pvh-earnings-stock-buy-point-hilfiger/).


**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) reports after the close.

Count **Charles River Laboratories International** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) among those companies both helped and hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic, but it's shaken off the hurt so quickly that CRL stock hit record highs Tuesday, earning its place as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




Charles River provides preclinical services to pharma and biotech companies. It also services governmental agencies and academic institutions. It is the largest non-clinical contract research organization.


The Wilmington, Mass.-based company's role is to help its customers through all the many steps involved in the discovery and early development and manufacture of new drugs and therapies. It helps speed that critical part of the process.


"We play such a crucial role in biomedical research," Charles River Chief Executive James Foster told Investor's Business Daily. "We like to say that we're the bridge between the biopharmas and the patients."

In fact, Foster says his company worked on 85% of the drugs, including vaccines, approved last year. And also 85% of those not approved. No one customer accounts for more than 2.5% of revenue, but Foster says virtually every big pharma and biotech is a client. He counts 6,000 or so biotech customers alone.


As a result, "We're proud to say we'll have played a role in what we hope is the speedy development of Covid-19 vaccines and drugs," Foster said.


CRL Stock: Regularly Setting New Highs
--------------------------------------


The 73-year-old company has built its skills and expertise to the point where CRL stock has been regularly setting new highs in the weeks after posting its worst earnings report in at least five years.


That's what the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic does even to companies clearly on a roll. In early August, Charles River reported adjusted per-share earnings of $1.58, down 3% from the year-earlier quarter. That marked its first bottom-line decline in at least five years.


Moreover, sales rose just 4%, to $682.6 million, marking the smallest revenue growth in at least five years.


And yet, earnings and sales handily beat Wall Street expectations, according to Zacks. Furthermore, Charles River raised its outlook for the year. It now expects sales to rise 7.5% to 9%, to $2.81 billion-$2.85 billion. Earlier, it projected just a 4.5% to 8% increase.


The company revised its expected revenue loss for 2020 from the Covid-19 pandemic to about $100 million from $135 million-$215 million.


As for adjusted earnings, the company raised its expected range to $7.05-$7.35 a share from $6.75-$7.10.


Slowdown From Academic Lab Closures
-----------------------------------


Foster said the slowdown last quarter stemmed largely from the closure of many academic lab customers. Charles River itself didn't slow its work. It's an essential business where its lab personnel already regularly used personal protective equipment and other safety measures.


Jefferies analyst David Windley last week raised his rating on CRL stock to buy.


"CRL is one of the best-positioned to benefit from biotechs' funding windfall," he said in a note to clients.


Said Foster: "We've had a fair amount of new work outsourced to us by customers who couldn't do it themselves or couldn't rely on other third parties."


UBS analyst Dan Brennan boosted his price target on CRL stock after the earnings report to 256 from 236.


"We believe industry tailwinds (biotech funding, Covid-work), CRL's positioning and execution, and less Covid disruption create an upward bias to guidance," he wrote in his note to clients.


CRL stock rose 2.4% to close at 225.30 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), surpassing its previous all-time high set on Aug. 7. CRL stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at a 222.07 buy point, its second breakout in two months.


CRL stock sports a solid Composite Rating of 92, putting it among the top 8% of all stocks.


Though sales growth slowed in 2019 and likely will slow this year as well, CRL stock sports a solid Composite Rating of 92, putting it among the top 8% of all stocks.

Trade Desk is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the digital advertising rival of Google attempts to break out from a three-weeks-tight chart pattern. Trade Desk stock spiked in February on better-than-expected earnings.




The company has been gaining market share vs. Google, analysts say, partly due to the **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) unit's decision in April to share less measurement data with advertisers because of consumer privacy issues. For Trade Desk, the Google decision has been the gift that keeps on giving, analysts say.


Ventura, Calif.-based Trade Desk's automated advertising buying tools enable customers to buy online and mobile ads. Trade Desk customers include mega-agencies Publicis Groupe and WPP.


Trade Desk stock popped 31% on Feb. 22 on its earnings beat and 2019 guidance. Trade Desk stock has soared more than 230% from a year ago.


Stocks form a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) if their consecutive weekly price change does not exceed 1.5%, either up or down in price. If a stock eventually breaks out in high volume, that could mark a new [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Trade Desk Stock Upside From Internet TV
----------------------------------------


Use of programmatic advertising is increasing in internet TV ad purchases. Analysts say Trade Desk could get a 2019 boost from Hulu's plan to open up more inventory to programmatic buying. Other Trade Desk TV partners include **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and **Dish Network**'s ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)) Sling video service.


Overseas markets continue to drive revenue growth, with Australia, Hong Kong and Germany among the bright spots.


At an analyst day last week, Trade Desk said it expects China to emerge as one of its top three markets. It plans to launch a new ad-buying service in China on March 26.


Google and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) dominate in digital advertising, though **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is a new entrant.


Google Restricts Measurement Data
---------------------------------


Facebook and Google are often known as "walled gardens" by advertisers. The reason is they have restricted usage of their consumer data by advertisers to their own ad platforms.


They also sell most of their ad inventory themselves with programmatic platforms.Â Google search and YouTube ads can only be bought through Google, for example.


Pressured by new consumer privacy rules in Europe, Google in April said it would no longer give advertisers access to key measurement data helpful in building online marketing campaigns.


Google told clients they could no longer use the "DoubleClick ID" to analyze ad measurement data across the internet. Google bought DoubleClick in 2007 for $3.1 billion.


Advertisers Angry At Google Decision?
-------------------------------------


"CMOs (chief marketing officers) at premium brands are essentially sharing their data with Google without receiving simple ID data in return, and it appears that many are fed up with the asymmetrical relationship," said Shyam Patil, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, in a report.


In the ad industry, both Trade Desk and Google operate so-called demand-side platforms, or DSPs.


"Google's decision to discontinue use of the DoubleClick ID limits advertisers' ability to measure and compare campaigns," Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz said in a report to clients. "This effectively raises the walls of the walled garden and exacerbates the problem of brands having an asymmetric relationship with Google, where they get little in the way of data back from the DSP."


Trade Desk stock jumped 5.2% to close at 204.38 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

**WillScot Mobile Mini** ([WSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSC)), a company that leases out mobile offices and portable storage units for the construction industry and others, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). WSC stock was hovering in between buy points.




The setup for WillScot Mobile Mini follows a string of acquisitions over the past several months, and after the company in February reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations.


At that time, the firm said it was "tracking toward the higher end" of its 2022 sales expectations. However, that forecast was still a bit more cautious than analysts' estimates.


WillScot earnings per share nearly doubled to 80 cents in 2021, with a 56% EPS gain seen this year.

WillScot and Mobile Mini merged in 2020. The combined company offers mobile offices and metal container offices — often found on construction sites, big events and other commercial or industrial project sites — that are [used by workers for meeting and planning](https://www.willscot.com/About/Industries/Construction).


Some of those office units can be stacked on top of one another, and have customizable interiors. With the economy rebounding from the pandemic, the company argues that those spaces are cheaper, more flexible and can be built more quickly, steering demand away from traditional fixed locations.


Fragmented Industry For WSC Stock
---------------------------------


WillScot Mobile Mini also offers portable storage containers, furniture, steps, ramps and other appliances. It also serves a variety of other industries, from agriculture to education to retail and wholesale trade.


WillScot has described the industry for those spaces as fragmented. The company said it fully integrated seven acquisitions in the second half of 2021.


"Prior to the pandemic, we'd anticipated the company outpacing industry revenue growth by leveraging its national size and scale while garnering incremental rate and margin via its differentiated add-on services such as furniture rental," Oppenheimer said in a research note on WSC stock last month. "That view has remained unchanged."

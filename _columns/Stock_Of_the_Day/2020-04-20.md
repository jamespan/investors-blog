Cloud computing is one of Alibaba's fastest-growing business units. The division's revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 62% to $1.4 million.


Alibaba looks to chip away at the leads held by **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in cloud computing. It's recognized as one of Asia's leading cloud players, though **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) are stepping up competition at home and abroad.


Alibaba Stock Action
--------------------


Alibaba stock climbed 1.3% to 212.13 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


According to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), Alibaba stock is forming a cup base with a buy point of 231.24.


But aggressive investors could consider an early buy point, based on a downward sloping trend line. Starting from when the stock hit a record high of 231.14 on Jan. 13, and down to current levels, that trendline shows an early buy point of 212.75, extending a buy area to 223.38.


Alibaba was added to IBD's [Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) list on April 15.


Alibaba [ended the fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/alibaba-earnings-q3-2020-alibaba-stock/) with 711 million active consumers on its e-commerce retail marketplaces. That was an increase of 18 million, or 2.5%, from the previous quarter. Moreover, active users on mobile devices reached 824 million, an increase of 39 million, or 5%.


The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.61 a share, up 47% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 36% to $23.2 billion.


Revenue in 2019 jumped 45% from the previous year to $55.58 billion. Alibaba has been consistently profitable for several years.


Alibaba Earnings Outlook
------------------------


For its current fiscal 2020, [earnings per share](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/) are expected to jump 28%, with 21% growth seen in fiscal 2021.


Similar to Amazon, Alibaba has made a big push into groceries and increasingly focuses on brick-and-mortar retail operations. Another growth driver comes from international expansion. The company manages to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.


The company held its initial public offering in 2014 and remains the largest tech IPO ever.


Alibaba is on the watchlist of [IBD's Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). Some of the best times to buy these leaders come during the latter stages of market corrections like the current one. Stock market corrections can pull down even the best stocks. But IBD Long-Term Leaders are companies with stable earnings growth and price performance. Often the best time to buy these stocks is during market weakness.

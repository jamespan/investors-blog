Dexcom stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after shares of the diabetes treatment specialist broke out to a record high.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), shares of **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) pulled back 0.8% to close at 237.30. Still, Dexcom [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) remained well above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 232.10 out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) on the weekly chart.


Wall Street is bullish on Dexcom stock heading into 2020. Dexcom makes devices known as continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs. These body-worn medical devices help diabetics measure the amount of glucose, a type of sugar, in their blood.


Cowen analyst Ryan Blicker called Dexcom stock his "top diabetes devices pick," in a recent report to clients.

"With the best product pipeline in the industry, we view Dexcom as the best way to invest in CGM," he said. "We expect significant top- and bottom-line upside vs. 2020 consensus expectations and growing appreciation for the non-intensive type 2 opportunity to drive shares higher in 2020."


Dexcom Stock Rises On 2020 Views
--------------------------------


There are two [types of diabetes](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-device-companies-ignite-revolution-diabetes-treatment/). Type 1 diabetes is genetic and begins in childhood. These patients don't naturally produce insulin on their own — they require frequent injections or an insulin pump. Without insulin, the body can't properly manage glucose. This can lead to dangerous spikes.


Type 2 diabetes is a degenerative condition. Patients can progress to the point that they don't make enough insulin. But most patients don't start out that way.


In general, CGMs are more common in patients with type 1 diabetes. But over time, Cowen analyst Blicker expects the medical devices to gain more traction in patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients who display symptoms of developing diabetes — known as prediabetes.


This will likely benefit Dexcom stock and other diabetes treatment players, he said.


"We view long-term non-intensive type 2 adoption as a question of when, not if," he said. "With the best product pipeline in the industry (both hardware and software), we believe Dexcom is the best way to invest in this secular growth industry."


Dexcom Rivals Medical Giant Abbott
----------------------------------


It's important to note that Dexcom isn't the only maker of body-worn glucose monitors in diabetes treatment. Dexcom competes against medical giant [**Abbott Laboratories**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abt-stock-buy-now/) ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)). Abbott sells the Freestyle Libre system. It rivals Dexcom's suite of products, the most recent of which is the G6.



Cowen's Blicker says the duo can exist together in diabetes treatment.


"Investors often view competition between Abbott and Dexcom as a zero-sum game," he said. "However, we believe both can be successful near- and long-term given the vast market opportunity and limited additional viable competition."


Later this year, Dexcom plans to roll out a limited number of its next-generation CGMs, dubbed G7. Abbott currently is working on an updated version of its device, known as Freestyle Libre 2. UBS analyst Matthew Taylor sees Dexcom's CGM products as the "gold standard, but expensive."


He also notes that CGMs could become more commoditized over time, leading insurers to focus on cost.


This increases "the importance of successfully bringing to market a lower-cost G7 device," he said in a recent report to clients. Taylor has a neutral rating on Dexcom stock.


Profit Growth Expected In Near-Term
-----------------------------------


On a quarterly basis, Dexcom's sales have grown by a double-digit percentage for years. Adjusted earnings growth is choppier, however. In the third quarter, Dexcom earned 65 cents a share, minus some items, on $396.3 million in sales, up a respective 261% and 49%.


Earnings growth is expected to be more moderate in the fourth quarter, up 31.5% to 71 cents a share, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research. Then, analysts expect $427 million in sales, an increase of 26.3%.


Dexcom earnings are expected to grow in the first and second quarters of 2020, before sliding in the third quarter. Sales growth is expected to continue to be in the double-digit range, though that could slow slightly in the first, second and third quarters.


Still, analysts polled by Zacks have a buy rating on Dexcom stock.


Dexcom Stock Has High Ratings
-----------------------------


Dexcom stock has a bullish Investor's Business Daily [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. This puts shares of the diabetes treatment specialist in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97. The 1-99 score pits a stock's 12-month performance against all stocks. On this measure, Dexcom stock ranks in the top 3%.

**Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as analysts expect the U.S.-based lithium giant to ride increased lithium prices to booming 2022 profits. ALB stock rose Tuesday, working on a possible handle.




Charlotte, N.C.-based Albemarle is the world's largest lithium producer and one of the leading providers of lithium for electric batteries. The company already supplies the crucial metal to **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Along with its lithium segment, the chemical manufacturing company also has bromine and chemical catalyst refining operations.


Lithium is the highly efficient energy storage medium used in virtually all batteries currently powering electric vehicles as well as consumer electronics. Lithium batteries also dominate the booming energy storage business for home and utility scale.

Throughout 2022, increased lithium prices resulted in booming profits for Albemarle. The lithium producer has averaged EPS growth of 334% over the last three quarters. The Benchmark Minerals' Lithium Price index soared 156% in 2022.


Lithium carbonate spot prices in China, the biggest EV market and a huge user of lithium, were around $71,000 per ton in January. This is down about 20% from record high prices of $84,000 per ton in November. Prices in China, which also handles most of the world's lithium refining, started 2022 at 244,510 yuan, or $34,700 per ton.


Albemarle Stock: Lithium Forecasts
----------------------------------


Many analysts expect lithium prices to retreat in 2023 with supply outstripping demand. However, Albemarle has increased its demand forecast due to higher expected EV production, as well as stronger demand for other lithium-ion battery applications.


On Jan. 24, Eric Norris, president of energy storage, told investors Albemarle expects 2030 lithium demand at 3.7 million tons, up 15% from its prior forecast.


The International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted annual lithium demand will increase to 2.5 million tons by 2030, up from around 500,000 tons today.


"Our updated demand outlook reflects our tremendous growth over the past year and accelerated future growth related to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA," Norris said.


"While government support like the IRA certainly helps, the reality is that the EV revolution is here to stay. In some regions and markets, EVs have already reached the tipping point of cost parity," he added.


Albemarle Stock
---------------


ALB shares advanced 3.5% to 281.45 Tuesday during [market trade](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Albemarle stock has formed a 38% V-shape base, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool?symbol=ALB&source=sitemarketcondition) analysis. ALB stock has an official 334.65 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares have vaulted back above the 50-day and 200-day lines, working up the right side of the base. It's possible that Albemarle is working on a handle, but that needs a few more days.



ALB stock hit a record 334.55 high on Nov. 11, but then sold off amid concerns that lithium prices would fall off in 2023, in part due to weaker-than-expected EV adoption amid high costs and recession worries. But price cuts from **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and others have revived EV sales prospects.


On Jan. 23, Albemarle reported preliminary Q4 earnings comfortably above views at the time and gave generally upbeat 2023 guidance.

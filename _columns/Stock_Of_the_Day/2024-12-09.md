**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Dow and S&P 500 banking stock eyes a buy point just above a key trading level amid its 55% advance this year.


Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck on Monday upped the price target on Goldman Sachs shares to 736, up from 570. That analyst expects President-elect Donald Trump to create a favorable environment for large-cap banking stocks.


Part of that will be higher capital-markets activity, and a "more favorable regulatory framework" likely to encourage mergers and acquisitions along with IPOs.




"While the (Republican) sweep also brings with it tariff and immigration changes, the size and impact to the economy is unknown today," Graseck added.


With the fourth quarter fast coming to an end, analysts project EPS growing 49% with revenue rising 7%. For the full year, the consensus puts Goldman Sachs profit up 60% to $36.63 per share on sales totaling $51.71 billion, a 12% gain compared with 2023. Analysts expect 2025 earnings per share of $42.74 and revenue coming in at $54.94 billion.


On Oct. 15, the global investment bank reported Q3 earnings of $8.40 per share to easily top FactSet expectations for $6.89. Net revenue rose 7% to $12.7 billion, well above expectations for $11.77 billion.


Net interest income rose to $2.62 billion. Goldman Sachs recorded a 20% increase in investment banking revenue while investment management revenue rose 10%. The bank increased its provision for credit losses to $397 million, up from $282 million in Q2 and $7 million last year, respectively.

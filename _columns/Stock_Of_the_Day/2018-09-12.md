Integrated oil and gas company **Ecopetrol** ([EC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Colombian energy firm surges past a buy point in heavy volume amid rising crude oil prices. Ecopetrol stock popped 12% to 25.17 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The breakout also triggered another confirming bullish signal.




Ecopetrol Stock Action
----------------------


After consolidating for several months, Ecopetrol stock is now trading at a new all-time high. With a [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at 22.86, Ecopetrol stock is already well above the proper [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/). Even at an alternate entry of 23.44, shares are trading 7% above that level.


As Ecopetrol stock hits new high ground in heavy turnover, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/chart-contents/) is now also at a new high. Since the RS line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500, seeing the line at a new high when a stock breaks out to a new high is a bullish indicator.



Rising Oil Prices Fuel Ecopetrol Stock
--------------------------------------


Ecopetrol, an integrated oil and gas company based in Columbia, has seen a turnaround over the past few years amid rising oil prices. [U.S. crude prices climbed](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-cuts-demand-growth-eia-weekly-data/) above $70 Wednesday, as the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3 million barrel drop in domestic crude stockpiles, nearly double the 2.7 million barrel drop analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expected. London-based Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, briefly edged past $80 a barrel, a 2018 high.


Ecopetrol: IBD Stock Of The Day
-------------------------------


The state-run oil company announced Tuesday a [$665 million debt financing deal](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/oilandgas/ecopetrol-inks-us665mn-financing-deal) with Scotiabank and Mizuho Bank.


While Ecopetrol boasts strong earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, the stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 76 out of 99.Â The Composite Rating looks at key fundamental and technical metrics like [earnings and sales growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/), profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.


The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D stands out as a red flag, as that indicates waning demand from institutional investors. Within the consolidation for today's IBD Stock Of The Day, the vast majority of heavy-trade sessions were down days for Ecopetrol stock. However, Wednesday's breakout is being supported with [heavy buying from institutions](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/).


Meanwhile, integrated oil and gas peers **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and **Total** ([TOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOT)) are working on [bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/). Marathon Oil stock is 6% below a cup-with-handle entry of 22.13. Total stock is 5% below a 65.79 entry point in a base-on-base formation.

**Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as continued growth in pet ownership drives increased need for Idexx's animal-health products. Idexx stock is currently building the right side of a cup base.




Overall, sales of veterinary products increased year to date through March 20, according to a recent note from Credit Suisse analyst Erin Wilson. Meanwhile, prescriptions from vets also rose in February â€” "an encouraging indicator of the ongoing strength in veterinary offices," she said.


Both metrics are bullish for Idexx stock. Idexx Laboratories makes diagnostic tests for animals. In terms of market cap, it ranks third in the 66-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. But it's among the biggest animal health companies.


"Pet adoption, prescription and veterinary clinic trends can be indicators of overall pet demand and offer a barometer of performance for our animal health coverage universe," Wilson said.

Idexx Stock Inches Toward Breakout
----------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Idexx stock gained 0.7% to close at 532.27. Shares are forming a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 574.09, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The relative strength line for IDXX stock is trying to bounce but is still well off highs, reflecting recent underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index. But long term, Idexx stock has a stellar RS line, which is why it's an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/tag/ibd-long-term-leaders/).



Investors in Idexx stock are keenly waiting for the company's earnings announcement in two weeks. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Idexx to report adjusted income of $1.71 per share on $738.4 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, Idexx earnings would jump 33% and sales would rise 18%.


Both measures would actually decelerate vs. the fourth quarter. But Wilson remains bullish on animal health trends.


Recent data from analytics firm VetWatch/Animalytix indicate "veterinary traffic and revenues are continuing their recovery and remain positive relative to 2020 levels." Overall year-to-date revenue for veterinary practices accelerated for the week ended March 20, Wilson said.


Representatives of Idexx didn't immediately return a request for comment.



Highly Rated Animal Health Stock
--------------------------------


If Idexx earnings on May 4 pan out nicely, shares could see further upside in 2021. On a year-to-date basis, Idexx stock rose 6.1% as of midday Tuesday.


That compares to a smaller 1.8% gain for fellow animal health company **Zoetis** ([ZTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTS)). Zoetis stock is also setting up a consolidation, with an entry at 176.74.


Idexx stock was also just added to the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/).


Its shares also have a bullish [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) of 95, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). That puts Idexx stock in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical growth measures.


Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) is lower, however, at 70. So shares are outperforming 70% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.

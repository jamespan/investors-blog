**Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the telemedicine company gains recognition amid the coronavirus pandemic. For that reason, TDOC stock is up 141% this year.




Telemedicine companies use videoconferencing and audio calls to conduct doctors' visits. As the lion's share of the world sheltered in place this spring, the industry experienced something of an inflection point. Now, analysts say, there's no slowing telemedicine companies.


In just a few weeks, consumer awareness of virtual care surged to 75% from 50%, JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a recent report. She doesn't expect that to change in a post-coronavirus world. Gill has an overweight rating on TDOC stock.


"Visits sharply accelerated in March and April due to shelter in place, zero-dollar copays and physician office closures," she said. "While the surge is expected to ease in the second quarter, it is expected to settle at a permanently higher level vs. pre-Covid."

TDOC Stock Rises Amid Pandemic
------------------------------


There are several moving parts telemedicine companies and regulators will have to navigate.


Due to the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began paying physicians for telehealth services at the same rate as in-office visits. Further, regulators also suspended requirements that doctors only utilize videoconferencing tools that are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Compliance Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA was designed to secure health information.


It's important to note, Teladoc's services are HIPAA-compliant. But it remains to be seen how these regulatory decisions will play out post-coronavirus.


"While these rule changes are temporary, there have been support for making those permanent, instead of reverting back to what had been in place prior to the Covid-19 pandemic," Gill said in a separate report.


Notably, a new House bill introduced this month would make permanent Medicare coverage for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, she said. It's also important to note, the bill has bipartisan support.


Inflection For Telemedicine Companies?
--------------------------------------


All together, it bodes well for TDOC stock.


The pandemic has large employers and health plans looking into virtual health offerings. The use of financial incentives will also likely drive increased use of telemedicine companies' services post-coronavirus, Gill said. She expects utilization to accelerate markedly.


Following the coronavirus pandemic, the telemedicine company expects to add 12 million to 13 million new members this year. That's well ahead of where Teladoc expected to be this year, Gill said. She also noted a 90% retention rate for insurance plans using the firm's services.



Teladoc also benefits from the acquisition of InTouch Health, a provider of telehealth services for hospitals and health systems. Using telemedicine technology inside a hospital system helps save precious personal protective equipment.


"Cross-selling opportunities and synergies are materializing faster than anticipated," she said. "The commercial agreement that allows them to go to market together has borne significant fruit, both domestically and internationally, with a growing pipeline."


Highly Rated Medical Stock
--------------------------


TDOC stock is currently trying to break out of a consolidation with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 203.95. The stock briefly ventured into the buy zone Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday — and closed above the buy point on Monday — but didn't stay there.


Of note, the telemedicine company's shares are holding up amid more widespread [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) malaise. On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), TDOC stock dropped 4.2% to 193.26 as the market took a bath Friday.


Teladoc stock has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 90 out of a best-possible 99. Even more bullish, shares have a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97.


The Composite Rating puts TDOC stock in the top 10% of all stocks in terms of key technical and fundamental measures. The strong RS Rating means TDOC is outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of its 12-month performance.

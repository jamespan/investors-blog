The [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) is Google-parent **Alphabet** ([IBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBD)), a tech juggernaut that's struggled to outperform the S&P 500 but is showing signs of renewed strength.







A key indicator of this is [Alphabet's relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which broke out to new highs the week of June 15. It's bullish when a stock's RS line hits a new high before the stock breaks out to a new price record. That suggests the stock, which is already outperforming the broad market, could continue to surge higher.


Alphabet stock is approaching a new high with a buy point of 1,201.59. Shares closed at 1201.26, up 2.5%, on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Alphabet stock is up 22% from an eight-month low of 984 set on March 28.


Another positive sign is the sales growth rate, which is expected to exceed 20% for the next three quarters. Alphabet stock has held above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) for the past two months. It also has a solid IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99.

The global search-engine leader, Alphabet stock is closely watched for a number of reasons. It's in the elite group of FANG stocks, which also includes **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Mention FANG among a group of investors and heads turn.


Digital Ad Dominance
--------------------


Another reason Alphabet stock is a big dog of tech is that Google collects the leading share of money spent on digital advertising, followed by Facebook. This year, Google is expected to receive 37% of U.S. digital ad spending. Facebook is likely to get 20%, according to research firm E-Marketer, combining for 57% of the market.


Recent events might have something to do with Alphabet's stock rise. One is Facebook's recent entanglement in the [Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scanda](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-price-target-cut/)l, which exposed personal information on millions of people.


After government investigations both here and in Europe, the fallout is leading to increased regulations. While regulation is typically a snare, in this case it could favor Alphabet and Facebook, says a Wall Street analyst, who this week [initiated buy ratings on both companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-alphabet-stock-analyst-rating/).


Their breadth, depth and overall size put Facebook and Google in a better position than smaller companies. Alphabet is also a leader in the development and [application of artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) vs. its competitors.

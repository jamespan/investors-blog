**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity stock broke out from a flat base on Monday. With third quarter earnings approaching for FTNT stock, investors may want to consider using a call option as a trading strategy.




Shares climbed 3.6% to close at 326.74 after topping the 322.10 buy point. Fortinet stock has advanced 119% in 2021. Some other [cybersecurity stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/), such as **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), are extended after big runs.


FTNT stock, though, has forged a flat base since reporting June-quarter earnings. [Recognizing chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) is one key to [IBD's stock trading system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).

Billings gained 35% to $961 million. Adjusted earnings rose 43% to 95 cents a share. Analysts had projected revenue of $745 million, profit of 88 cents a share and billings of $872 million.


FTNT Stock: High Expectations After Strong Run
----------------------------------------------


Despite the solid beat, some investors focused on guidance, with some analysts questioning whether growth may have peaked. The bearish view is that Fortinet earnings reports will face tough year-over-year comparisons in 2022.


At a virtual investor day in March, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Fortinet said it expects at least $4 billion in revenue and $5 billion in billings by 2023.


The billings estimate came in above Wall Street's target of $4.7 billion while the revenue outlook met expectations.


Fortinet's core business is selling computer network "firewall" appliances. In that market, Fortinet competes versus Palo Alto Networks and others. Firewall appliances protect computer networks by blocking online intrusions and monitoring web-based apps.


Fortinet Stock: Push Into SD-WAN Key
------------------------------------


Fortinet has pushed into software-defined, wide-area network technology. Known as SD-WAN, this networking gear links corporate headquarters with branch offices and remote workers.


Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Nowinski recently initiated coverage on FTNT stock with an overweight rating.


"Fortinet is gaining traction in the mid/large enterprise markets, without having to compete head to head with other large firewall vendors such as Palo Alto Networks," he wrote. "The company is leveraging solutions such as SD-WAN, cloud security and IoT (Internet of Things) security as a way in to penetrate this space."


Fortinet's impressive growth is tied to semiconductor technology built into its network security appliances, analysts say. Fortinet has developed custom, application-specific integrated circuits. The devices combine SD-WAN with firewall capabilities, for example.


While chip shortages remain a global supply chain issue for many companies, Fortinet has not reported any issues to date.


Fortinet stock also holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/)of 96 out of a best-possible 99.


IBD Composite Rating Strong
---------------------------


In addition, FTNT stock holds a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of a best possible 99. The Composite Rating is a blend of the other five IBD stock ratings: the earnings per share or EPS Rating, Relative Price Strength Rating, Accumulation/Distribution Rating, Industry Group Relative Strength Rating and the SMR Rating.


The latter measures sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. The all-encompassing Composite Rating helps investors easily measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


In addition, Fortinet is slated to report September quarter earnings after the market close on Nov. 4. Also, investors could take positions ahead of the earnings report.


Another strategy around earnings would use [call options](https://www.investors.com/research/options/call-options-can-leverage-potential-gains-in-snap-stock-as-it-nears-buy-point/) allowing investors to buy cybersecurity stocks at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk.

**West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares of the medical supplier approach a buy point. WST stock could be buyable even now, but investors should tread cautiously.




The company is one of Investor's Business Daily's [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/tag/ibd-long-term-leaders/). It makes the components used to inject drugs — including vials, plungers, pre-filled syringes and other materials. Shares are on a decade-long growth spree and gained markedly during the pandemic.


But Covid is a relatively small part of West Pharma's business. The company sells to a variety of drug and biologic makers. It's expected to report more than $2.8 billion in sales this year. The company's projection for $450 million in Covid-related sales would be just a drop in that bucket.


On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), WST stock climbed 1.1% to 449.62.

WST Stock: Covid Landscape A Moving Target
------------------------------------------


The Covid landscape seems to shift on a weekly basis, said Quintin Lai, the company's vice president of corporate development, strategy and investor relations, during a recent conference. West Pharma began scaling its capacity in 2020 to deal with the pandemic, however.


But, for West Pharma, that merely accelerated existing plans, Lai said.


"Because the components we're making for Covid-19 are the same components we're using for some of the drugs that are being used today," he said. "In that regard, we'll grow into that capacity."


That was early thinking. Soon, West Pharma proved a popular choice for injectable components as the delta variant began sweeping the world. Then, authorities in various countries — including the U.S. — began recommending booster shots to contend with delta.


So, "we don't see a decline in the business" for 2022, Lai said.


Injectable Drugs Growing In Popularity
--------------------------------------


WST stock analysts agree with Lai. For 2022, they project $3.08 billion in sales. In 2023-2024, analysts expect West Pharma to report accelerating sales — 9% and 13% growth, respectively. This comes despite expected sales declines those years for vaccine makers [**Pfizer**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) and [**Moderna**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/) ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)).


West Pharma's Lai says injectable drugs are growing as a category. More complex drugs — biologics and large molecules — are driving that growth, he said. And many of those are utilizing the company's more expensive products, like NovaPure and FluroTec. NovaPure includes high-standard vial stoppers and plungers. FluroTec is a barrier firm that separates the drug from its enclosure.



"That volume increase that we're getting is also coming with our premium products," Lai said.


As a [Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen), WST stock is now considered buyable because it's close to a pullback to its 10-week moving average. It's also within striking distance of a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 455.91 out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) on the weekly chart, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). But current market conditions are in flux and even the hardiest stocks, like West Pharma, could falter.


Shares also have a nearly perfect [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 98, putting WST stock in the leading 2% of all stocks in terms of profit growth. Further, WST stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, which means it ranks in the top 4% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical measures, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital).

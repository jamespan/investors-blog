Specialty flooring provider **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). FND stock is breaking out of a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) as new home starts remain strong.




Demand for homes away from urban centers or for larger dwellings with more amenities for working from home continues to fuel new construction.


There were 1.6 million new home starts in June, up 6.3% from May and higher than analysts' forecasts, according to data out this week from the Census Bureau.


The construction figures are good news for Atlanta-based Floor & Decor. The company operates 150 retail locations across the U.S., providing everything from tile flooring to marble backsplashes.


But the industry has been hit with increasing raw material prices in recent months. Lumber prices are down from earlier highs but remain elevated.

The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is largely moving sideways, but is above the handle's high.


Meanwhile, FND stock has a C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which shows slightly more buying than selling by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks. After the market close, the rating improved to a B-.


It has a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of 99 and a best-possible EPS Rating of 99. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


It has a perfect 99 EPS Rating. It will report second-quarter results after the market closes on Aug. 5. Analysts polled by FactSet see earnings soaring 370% to 61 cents per share with sales jumping 81% to $836 million.

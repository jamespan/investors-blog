Recreational gear maker **Yeti Holdings** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the continued boom in outdoor activities fueled soaring earnings. Yeti stock flashed a bullish signal.




The company makes trendy and pricey coolers and drinkware, popular with outdoor enthusiasts. Coolers range in price from $80 for personal-sized ones to $1,200 for larger varieties. Yeti is also expanding its presence in another market — luggage, including duffels and backpacks for adventure seekers.


First-quarter earnings per share exploded 245% to 38 cents, easily beating views for 21 cents. Revenue grew 42% to $247.6 million, topping forecasts for $220.3 million.


Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 59% to $126.8 million. Drinkware sales increased 32% to $148.9 million. Cooler and equipment sales surged 57% to $93.5 million.


Yeti now sees adjusted EPS of $2.28-$2.32 vs. its February target of $2.11-$2.14, with the Q1 beat of 17 cents largely accounting for the raised forecast. Analysts expected $2.16. The company targets 20%-22% revenue growth vs. its prior goal of 15%-17%.

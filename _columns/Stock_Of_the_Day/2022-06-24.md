**Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it stands up well against the volatile market. CNC stock isÂ regaining technical support within a valid base.




The St. Louis-based company is one of the largest Medicaid-based managed care organizations in the country. While Centene primarily provides health care products and services through Medicaid and Medicare, it also works through private insurers.


CNC and other managed care providers have been mounting a rally this week amid a market that has been rocked by fears of a recession.


Centene Stock
-------------


CNC stock closed down 0.9% to 82.91 in Friday's [market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-signal-broad-market-rally-zendesk-spikes-china-stocks-keep-rising/). The stock is above its 50-day moving average and has formed a double-bottom base with an 87.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). If Centene manages to get above its high from Thursday high, around 84, it would break a downward sloping trendline. That would provide aggressive investors an early entry around that 84 level.



CNC peer **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is also in a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The buy point on that base is 507.35.

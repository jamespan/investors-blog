**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Chipotle stock moved closer to a breakout on Tuesday, and the stock is outperforming the broader market as the fast-casual Mexican food chain continues a turnaround effort in the wake of food-safety issues.







Chipotle Stock
--------------


Chipotle stock rose 2.5% to 497.47 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), working on a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) with a 501.08 buy point. Tuesday's advance follows a 6.6% gain on Monday, when it bounced higher off the 50-day average.


The stock market's recent [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) indicates a new uptrend is underway, but it follows a steep correction marked by high volatility.


Chipotle's relative strength line, a measure of how well a stock is doing compared to the S&P 500, is at highs not seen since June 2017. Chipotle stock has a Composite Rating of 89 out of a best-possible 99. Chipotle stock surged 49% through 2018.


The chain has struggled in recent years with food-safety concerns. But management in October [said its "For Real" marketing campaign](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q3-food-safety-incident/) boosted sales during the third quarter. The company earlier in the year got a new CEO, Taco Bell veteran Brian Niccol, and other new top executives.

Price Hikes Coming?

Chipotle could also have more room to raise menu prices. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, in a research note last month, said that based on a survey by the firm, Chipotle's national Mexican-food competitors priced popular entrees 6.6% higher.


"We believe this indicates Chipotle has room to raise menu prices across the country or possibly adopt a different pricing structure (fewer tiers, more inclusive) that could raise average check," Saleh wrote.


Chipotle earnings jumped 62% in Q3 vs. a year earlier while sales growth has picked up slightly in the past two quarters.

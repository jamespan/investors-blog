**Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after touching a new intraday high Wednesday despite a drastic market pullback, as the coronavirus pandemic is expected to create increased demand for its remote work software.




Citrix provides a digital workspace platform that gives workers access to the applications and content they need for work, including apps, data and communications on any device, over networks and in the cloud.


It has a software-as-a-service business model supported by cloud computing technologies. Citrix says it has more than 100 million users across 400,000 organizations.


Working remotely is growing rapidly as the Covid-19 outbreak has businesses mandating work from home in many cases.

Citrix Stock Activity
---------------------


Citrix stock fluctuated throughout the day, and ended trading up 2.4% to 130.50 on the [stock market today,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) just short of a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 130.65. Earlier in the day, Citrix stock shot above the buy zone, hitting a record high of 139.03. But it pulled back during a sharp sell-off in the stock market and was down at various points throughout the session.


Buying stocks in a bear market comes with a high risk. It's wiser for investors to place well-performing stocks on their watchlist for further evaluation.


What makes Citrix an appropriate candidate to watch is its relative strength line, which has moved into record territory.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.


The stock also has a healthy [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Citrix stock currently outperforms 95% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


In addition, the stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


Best Stocks To Buy And Watch
----------------------------


When looking for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), focus on those with rising relative price strength.


While the company's bottom line growth declined in its most recent quarterly report from 9% to 2%, the top line rose 1%, up from 0% in the previous report.


The company said that adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.71, up 2% from the year-ago period, with revenue rising 1% to $810 million, topping analyst estimates.


Citrix holds the No. 5 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Special Enterprise industry group. That's up from No. 11 recently.


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) is No. 1 in the group, followed by **Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)) then **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)).


Upgrades On Citrix Stock
------------------------


Raymond James analyst Robert Majek, on Tuesday, upgraded Citrix to a rating of outperform, from market perform, with a price target on Citrix stock of 124.


The upgrade came after Majek conducted a series of tests with resellers. The results indicated increased demand for remote access work-from-home solutions in response to Covid-19.


"We believe the surge in business continuity planning, including facilitation of remote work, could be a structural change that drives virtual desktop and application demand not only this quarter but in the next 1-2 years, giving us increased confidence Citrix can meet or exceed 2020 and 2021 street growth estimates," Majek wrote in a note to clients.


William Blair analyst Jason Ader last week also upgraded Citrix to outperform, from market perform.


"Our rating change is driven by the view that the wake-up-call nature of the current crisis will drive many organizations to expand their usage of (Citrix) technologies, which should result in a higher long-term growth rate for Citrix and a re-rating of Citrix stock," Ader wrote in a note to clients.

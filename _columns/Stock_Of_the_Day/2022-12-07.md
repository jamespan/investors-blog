**Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the financial services company lurks not far off a buy point after an aggressive run this year. IBKR shares edged lower Wednesday.




The Greenwich, Conn.-based online brokerage offers trading in stocks, bonds, futures, currencies and options in over 33 countries. The [financial services company's rivals](https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-trading-app-for-the-young-pushes-into-retirement-accounts-with-incentive/) include **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)).


Billionaire Thomas Peterffy founded Interactive Brokers in 1993. He still chairs the company and owns a majority of the Interactive Brokers stock.


On Oct. 18, Interactive Brokers [reported mixed third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/charles-schwab-interactive-brokers-earnings/), topping earnings estimates but missing on revenue. The financial services company's EPS recovered from two slack quarters, gaining 38% to $1.08. Revenue increased 22% to $790 million in Q3. Net interest income catapulted 73% to $473 million on higher interest rates. Meanwhile, commission revenue edged up 3% to $320 million on higher volumes of customers trading futures, and higher options commissions per contract.


Interactive Brokers has benefited from rising interest rates this year, as the Federal Reserve hikes its target rate to combat inflation. Like many financial outfits, Interactive Brokers stands to benefit from a higher interest rate environment.


Last week, Interactive Brokers reported its client daily average revenue trades (DARTS) dropped by 30% in November compared to last year. Its client equity in November was $317.3 billion, 15% lower than a year earlier but 7% higher than the end of October.


Analysts expect the company to announce Q4 earnings in mid-January. Wall Street forecasts earnings up 42% to $1.18 per share, according to FactSet. Revenue is predicted to balloon 54% to $928 million.

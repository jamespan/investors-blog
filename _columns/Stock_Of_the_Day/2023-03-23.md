Meritage Homes is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the homebuilder closes in a buy point after finding key technical support and flashing a key bullish signal. MTH stock is already actionable.




**Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) builds single-family detached homes, mostly in the central and western U.S. It claims to set the standard for energy-efficient homes.


Homebuilder stocks are acting well as the housing market starts to recover, including **KB Home** ([KB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KB)), which jumped on strong earnings Thursday.


Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a six-month high in February and have now increased for three straight months, data released Thursday showed. Analysts said that the housing market may be stabilizing, after a pounding from high mortgage rates.


On March 23, MTH stock joined the prestigious [IBD Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as it showed bullish technical action. The homebuilder boasts a strong earnings history.


Still, the stock market is in a correction. Investors should be cautious about making new purchases, but it's a good time to build watch lists.

MTH stock is nearing a 117.32 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) from a large cup-with-handle base. The handle qualifies as a flat base of its own.


The homebuilder stock found support at the 50-day/10-week moving average during the recent volatility, the [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for MTH stock has been striking fresh ahead of a possible breakout, a bullish technical sign. The RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.


Investors could use Thursday's move as an early entry, clearing a downward-sloping trendline in the handle as well as clearing some short-term levels. Investors could use a decisive break of the 50-day line as a sell signal.

MTH Earnings
------------


The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Meritage Homes boasts an enviable record of earnings growth. The homebuilder has seen its earnings vault from $3.41 a share in 2017 to $26.74 in 2022, growing at a robust pace despite the Covid-19 pandemic.


On a per-share basis, Meritage earnings jumped nearly 39% in 2022, following a 75% leap the prior year.


But earnings growth has slowed the past three quarters. The Street sees earnings plunging 52% in 2023, due in part to some tough year-over-year comparisons.


Sales are also seen tumbling 23% this year.


Analysts call for a nearly 8% earnings rebound in 2024 as sales bounce 4%. But both earnings and sales would still be far below 2022 levels.


Industry peers include KB Home, which soared 8% on earnings Thursday. KBH stock approached a breakout of its own.


Peers also include **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)).


All those homebuilder stocks are broadly moving through late stages of valid bases, near buy points or early entries.

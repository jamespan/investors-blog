**Magna** ([MGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) reopens factories after chip shutdowns and with the auto supplier reportedly near an **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) car deal. Magna stock topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).




In May, Ontario-based Magna saw earnings accelerate for a third straight quarter and raised guidance for all of 2021. It expects stronger sales in China to offset a slowdown in North America, its largest market.


Magna Stock Technical Analysis
------------------------------


Shares popped 4% to 100.02 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), hitting a record 100.71 intraday. Magna stock cleared a short consolidation, which would have been a flat base with a 99.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) after Friday, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The auto supplier stock has rebounded from the 10-week line, after riding that key support level for a while. MGA stock also cleared a short trend line Thursday before the official breakout.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Magna stock has rallied to highs as growth returns after a couple tough years. A rising RS line means that a stock is currently outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown.


Magna holds a solid [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That means it has outperformed 90% of all stocks in the past year.


Its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is 82. It's the No. 2 stock in its industry group — Auto/Truck-Original Equipment — behind **Gentherm** ([THRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THRM)).


Magna shows four quarters of rising fund ownership, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-walt-disney-company-dis.aspx). As of March, 455 funds own shares, up 4% from the prior quarter.


GM Reopening, Apple Car
-----------------------


On Thursday, General Motors said it is restarting five factories that were shut down because of the semiconductor shortage. Earlier in May, Magna said it expects industry supply constraints to continue through Q2, though it didn't mention the chip shortage specifically.


A key GM supplier, Magna provides parts such as mirrors, truck frames, driveline systems, fascias and seat systems. Magna also makes entire vehicles for brands such as BMW and Jaguar.


Magna recently reached a deal with **Fisker** ([FSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSR)) to make that EV startup's upcoming Ocean SUV starting in 2023.


That manufacturing expertise and growing EV know-how is a key reason why Magna is a likely candidate for building a possible Apple Car.


In April, [the Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/04/129_307089.html) said LG Electronics and Magna were "very near" to signing a deal with Apple to build its initial electric cars. An LG-Magna JV, set up last December, develops e-motors, inverters, onboard chargers and e-drive systems for electric vehicles (EVs).


As a result, Magna's seen to offer strong EV exposure, as automakers including GM and Ford accelerate their shift away from combustion cars.


Among other GM suppliers, Gentherm stock climbed 1.6%, **Aptiv** ([APTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APTV)) gained 5.2%, and **Borg Warner** ([BWA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWA)) advanced 1.8% amid the plant reopening news.


GM stock popped 2.9% to 59.35, clearing a short trend line and rebounding from its 10-week line. That offers a buying opportunity, though shares are off intraday highs.


**Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) jumped 7.3% to a fresh multiyear high, extending Wednesday's breakout on EV optimism.

Magna Earnings Return To Growth
-------------------------------


After a tough few years marked by trade wars and the coronavirus pandemic, Magna sports a mediocre [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 74 out of 99. Its [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=SMR+Rating&termid=1) is a C, on a scale of A+ to a worst E.


But the latest quarter added to a string of earnings beats from the automotive supplier in recent quarters.


In Q1, Magna earnings more than doubled to $1.86 a share as revenue grew 18%.


Over the past three quarters, Magna grew earnings 85% on average. Sales growth ramped up to 18% in Q1 from 12% the prior quarter, snapping a long string of quarterly declines. On an annual basis, EPS fell in 2019 and 2020. The back-to-back trade wars and pandemic stay-at-home measures hit car sales.


In 2021, Wall Street sees Magna earnings vaulting 90% to $7.51 per share as sales jump nearly 26%, according to Zacks Investment Research. That should be above pre-pandemic EPS levels as well.


Seven analysts rate MGA stock a buy; four have a hold and none has a sell, Zacks says.

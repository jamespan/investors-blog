**Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the audio entertainment giant broadens beyond music, podcasts and audiobooks and into self-help and educational courses. Spotify stock is flirting with a buy point.


The Stockholm-based company on Tuesday announced an initiative to provide self-improvement courses, starting with a venture with fitness brand Adidas.




"Whether you want to discover the benefits of meditation, hone a new skill, or progress your career, you can learn it through courses on Spotify," the company said in a [blog post](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-01-21/set-a-course-of-self-improvement-with-spotify-plus-a-special-offer-from-adidas/). "Courses cover a range of topics, including music, business, and lifestyle, so you can explore your passions and ambitions in a new way, at your own pace, and on your own time."


[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/spotify-educational-courses-could-be-coming-to-us/) reported that Spotify has been piloting its educational courses initiative in the U.K. since last year.


In morning trades on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Spotify stock rose 1.2% to close at 493.56. Earlier in the session, it hit a record high of 510.84.


Spotify stock is flirting with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 506.47 from a shallow [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-without-handle-base-can-runneth-over-with-rich-stock-chart-gains/), according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. Aggressive investors could have bought Spotify stock above 500.86 as it cleared short-term highs, based on [IBD analysis](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/).


In a bullish sign, Spotify's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsurge/) is hitting new highs as it outperforms the broad market.


The next major catalyst for Spotify stock is the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 4.


Analysts polled by FactSet expect Spotify to earn $2.07 a share on sales of $4.32 billion in the December quarter. In the year-earlier period, Spotify lost 39 cents a share on sales of $3.94 billion.


Further, analysts predict that Spotify will add 7.9 million premium subscribers for a total of 259.9 million worldwide.


Wall Street also is modeling 664 million monthly active users in the fourth quarter, vs. 640 million in the third quarter. Spotify offers a free, ad-supported service in addition to its commercial-free subscription service.


Last week, Spotify stock received [several price-target hikes](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-rocks-higher-price-target-hikes/) from Wall Street analysts. The analysts noted Spotify's improved profitability and strong revenue growth.

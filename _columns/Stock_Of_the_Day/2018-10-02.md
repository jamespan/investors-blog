**CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the rail giant builds up a head of steam thanks to the improving U.S. economy. It's the leading stock in a rising industry group, and it's working on a new buy point.




The transportation company looks to benefit from the Trump administration's revamped USMCA trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Rail networks should see outsize benefits from an increase in domestic production.


Florida-based CSX operates approximately 21,000 route miles of track.


Shares fell 0.9% to 74.33 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The rail stock is closing in on a 76.34 buy point from a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/), according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). It's been finding support at its 10-week line. CSX stock previously broke out of a short flat base on July 18, following the company's Q2 earnings report.

Stock Of The Day Hails From Top Group
-------------------------------------


CSX has powered to the top of the [Transportation-Rail industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-01-2018/), which itself has momentum. It's now 27th out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. That's up from 71 just seven weeks ago.


**Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) fell 0.7% Tuesday. Union Pacific stock is consolidating at record highs after breaking out in late July. **Canadian National Railway** ([CNI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNI)) broke out Monday on the U.S.-Canada trade deal. But Canadian National stock fell 1.6% to 89.93 on Tuesday, undercutting the 90.67 entry. **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)), which has rail links with Mexico, fell 1.8%, sinking below a buy point and its 50-day line.


CSX's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500, has been on a bullish uptrend throughout 2018. The rail stock also found support after inching down toward its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), which is another positive sign.



CSX Stock Fundamentals
----------------------


Back in July the railroad giant beat Q2 views when it reported that earnings jumped 58% to $1.01 a share; revenue climbed 6% to $3.1 billion. The latest profit gain follows increases of 53%, 31% and 6%. The strong results are a good sign for the industry and economy. CSX's Q3 earnings report is on Oct. 16.


Rail stock CSX's [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) has made great strides since the start of the year, and now sits at a muscular 97. This puts it in the top 3% of stocks tracked.


CSX has been taking strides to transform itself and become more competitive. Its efforts are paying off, with the firm achieving a record operating ratio in it most recent quarter.


Seeking efficiency, it cut service in several low-volume lanes linking the Southeast and Northeast. The Dow Jones Transportation Average stock also axed some interline service with Union Pacific. It also laid off 1,000 management employees last year.

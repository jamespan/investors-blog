**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it tries to hold support at the 50-day line. American Express stock is outperforming the broader stock market, along with fellow payment stocks **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), with their payment networks protecting them from the current turbulence.


Analysts see American Express' formidable card business and the massive opportunities ahead as consumers and businesses alike shift toward electronic payments as growth drivers.


American Express Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------------------


Shares fell 0.1% to 114.62 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), holding a 114.35 buy point from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-cup-with-handle/) cleared in late April, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). However, investors should hold off on buying stocks while the market remains in a correction phase. They should wait for a confirmed uptrend before buying any names on their watch list.


American Express stock also found support at its 50-day line. The growth trends for payment stocks in general is strong, and the Dow Jones stock is benefiting from this. This is one of the reasons its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been on a strong upward trend since mid-April and remains near a four-year high.



American Express stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 93, which is just two points shy of the ideal 95. But [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-american-express-co-axp.aspx) shows that earnings are acting as a tailwind. American Express earnings growth has decelerated significantly in the past two quarters — to just 7% and 8%, respectively — in part due to tougher comparisons. While earnings topped views in the latest quarter, [American Express revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/american-express-earnings-q1-2019-american-express-stock/) fell short.


Analysts see American Express earnings rising 11% in both 2019 and 2020. That's short of the [25% minimum preferred by CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), but not bad for such a large, mature company.

Rival Payment Stocks Also Holding Up
------------------------------------


The [Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-may-31-2019/) group is rated seventh out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. The strong recurring-revenue model is allowing it to hold up even amid trade uncertainty, with the U.S. now taking a more aggressive stance against Mexico as well as China.


While American Express is doing well, so is Dow Jones component Visa, though it sank below its 50-day line Monday. Visa stock fell 1.8% as it works on a possible flat base. It has a strong Composite Rating of 98, with sold earnings growth.


Mastercard stock, like American Express stock, is trying to hold its 50-day line as it consolidates near record highs.


Mastercard stock fell 3.7%, dropping below its 50-day as well. Its Composite Rating is also a top-notch 98, while its earnings growth is even better than Visa's. Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider has said Mastercard stock will benefit from increasing share in the "underpenetrated" European market. He also believes it is perfectly poised to lead in the business-to-business market, which is seen as [offering a $1 trillion opportunity for payment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/?preview_id=3729964).

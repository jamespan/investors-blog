JD.com Stock: Rivals Jump As Well
---------------------------------


Also moving up strongly Wednesday was Pinduoduo, climbing 10% to 107.65 and a new high. Alibaba stock rose 4.2%, near 297.70.


JD.com reported second-quarter results on Aug. 17 that beat estimates, leading to a breakout for JD stock. Among highlights in the [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-earnings-q2-jd-stock-alibaba-rival/), active annual customers jumped 30% to 417.4 million from the year-ago period. Mobile daily active users grew 40%.


Revenue climbed 30% to $28.5 billion, which was about $1 billion above estimates. The company has achieved double-digit revenue growth every quarter going back several years and has been consistently profitable.


JD.com has not yet announced a reporting date for third-quarter earnings. However, Alibaba reports quarterly results Thursday morning.


Walmart established a relationship with JD.com in 2016 and owns a 9.8% stake in the company. JD.com collaborates with Walmart on e-commerce. That includes the establishment of a Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart China flagship store on JD.com's website.


Another JD.com partner is Alphabet, which invested $550 million in JD.com in 2018. The two companies are exploring the creation of next-generation retail infrastructure services.


JD.com's strategic partnership with China-based internet giant Tencent has a number of moving parts. For example, JD.com has access to Tencent's wildly popular messaging and mobile payment service called WeChat. The partnership drives mobile users to JD.com.

The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a record high Wednesday, a positive sign.

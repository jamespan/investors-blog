IPOs can take two different paths after their debut. For example, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), known as Google in 2004, formed a short base and broke out. The stock gained 77% in about 10 weeks.




A fast and disciplined move out of the gate, though, is rare for initial public offerings.


More common is what investors see in the wild trade of Pinterest stock that has yet to settle into a base. The stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on April 18. The IPO was priced at 19 a share but **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) spent its first day trading between 25.18 and 23.05, closing at 24.40.


Pinterest then spurted almost 45% from its opening day close. The gain came in just seven sessions. A sharp pullback followed, leaving the stock currently just under 30. Despite the wild action, the stock is forming an IPO base with a potential buy point at 35.39.


Money Loser
-----------


The company has lost money in each of the past three years: 34 cents a share in 2016; 24 cents in 2017; and 12 cents last year. Revenue jumped 58% in 2017 and 60% last year. Such strong sales growth has been a trait of the more successful new issues this year, so Pinterest can be a stock to watch.


Analysts expect Pinterest to lose 23 cents a share this year and then book a penny a share profit in 2020.


Quarterly profits came in at 9 cents a share in the fourth quarter. But the Street estimates the first quarter loss will be 16 cents a share. So this is a company that has yet to prove it can deliver consistent profits despite strong revenue gains.


The company will report quarterly results after the close May 16.


Without earnings, an individual investor can't gauge either profit margins or return on equity. They don't exist yet. The potential investor would be pinning all their hopes on the big revenue gains.


For the Pinterest bulls, a watch list is the proper place for the stock.


Yet, there is one other way to play IPOs like Pinterest — an exchange traded fund that revolves around IPOs.


ETF Offers Another Choice
-------------------------


Renaissance IPO ETF ([IPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPO)) includes Pinterest in its lineup. As of May 7, Renaissance had [73 IPO stocks](https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Investing/US-IPO-ETF-Holdings) in its ETF, including Pinterest.


Renaissance adds stocks to the IPO fund on a fast-entry basis. For example, Pinterest was added April 25, only four days after the IPO.


So far this year, Renaissance is up 33%, easily topping the Nasdaq's 20% gain.


Companies are removed from the ETF after two years because Renaissance no longer considers them IPOs at that point.

**Leslie's** ([LESL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LESL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the biggest fish in the pool supplies retail category capitalizes on the long-term opportunity created by a stay-at-home, pool construction boom. Retail stock LESL, an October 2020 IPO, rose toward a cup-with-handle buy point in Wednesday stock market action.




Though a relatively new issue, the Phoenix-based retailer has a long track record, including 57 years of consecutive sales growth. That's testament to its predictable recurring revenue model. Leslie's says that about 80% of its product assortment for residential and commercial pools and spas is nondiscretionary. If pools aren't properly cared for, it creates risks of illness, having to resort to expensive chemical treatments, even structural damage.


That means the surge in pool construction and permitting sparked by Covid will create a higher base of sales for Leslie's, not a wave that crests and falls.


The pool construction backlog going well into next season is "a great leading indicator as we get to take care of those pools and the maintenance needs for the next 30 years," CFO Steve Weddell said on the May 5 fiscal second-quarter earnings call.


Leslie's had 940 stores at the start of April, up eight from a year earlier. The company says its physical footprint exceeds that of its 20 largest competitors combined. Still, it has a long growth runway in a fragmented $11-billion market with 8,000 independent and regional retailers.


Leslie's growth strategy includes more stores, M&A, and winning new customers, including professional pool servicers, with loyalty rewards and incentives like free in-store water tests.

LESL Retail Stock
-----------------


LESL stock rose 0.5% to 29.26, within 5% of a 30.95 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) buy point, according to a [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The pool supplies retail stock's first breakout from its [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) came in late December and carried into late January when the stock peaked at 32.84. However, the breakout failed in February as Leslie's reported fiscal Q1 earnings and announced a secondary offering from selling shareholders.


Leslie's stock rose as high as 30.85 on April 27, which proved to be the start of its handle on the right side of the cup pattern. The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 10 cents above the top of that handle.


Leslie's is part of IBD's [Retail-Leisure Products industry group](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-leslies-inc-lesl.aspx), which is ranked No. 4 out of 197 based on price performance and momentum. **Pool Corp.** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)), a pool supplies wholesaler, is another member of the group.


Leslie, which has a September ending fiscal year, does much better in the spring-summer quarters of fiscal Q2 and Q3 than in Q4 and Q1. For fiscal 2021, investors see Leslie earnings surging 188% to 72 cents after spiking to 33 cents in fiscal 2020 from 1 cent in fiscal 2019.

Qorvo Guidance Well Above Views
-------------------------------


The company attributed its strong results to sales of chips for 5G and Wi-Fi 6 wireless communications.


For the current quarter, Qorvo expects to earn an adjusted $2.65 a share on sales of $1.06 billion. Analysts were forecasting $1.90 in earnings per share on $923.4 million in sales. In the year-earlier period, Qorvo earnings were $1.86 a share on sales of $869.1 million.


Qorvo was one of several Apple chip suppliers that delivered upbeat earnings reports for the calendar third quarter. Others included **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)), **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)).


Apple typically represents about 35% to 40% of Qorvo's revenue, according to investment bank Oppenheimer.


"Recent strong execution has Qorvo ideally positioned to capitalize on 5G structural growth," Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a Nov. 5 note to clients. He rates Qorvo stock as outperform with a price target of 170.



Qorvo Stock Tied For First Place In Group

**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) stands out among software companies by delivering a potent combo of revenue growth and profits while not sacrificing one for the other.




And, not many software companies have delivered like Paycom stock since going public. Paycom stock has brought in more than a 10-fold return since its 2014 initial public offering at $15 a share.


Paycom also stands out as a technology company based in Oklahoma City, where many energy firms like **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) are headquartered. The company sells workforce management software.


All that said, the question for investors is whether this is a good time to buy Paycom stock. It has shot up 64% over the past year. The big gain includes earnings beat that sparked a breakaway gap-type rally.

CLOSE




Paycom stock now has a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 186.10 for adding shares if it establishes a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). Shares in Paycom fell 1.6% to close at 175.64 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).


Paycom Stock Forming Special Chart Pattern
------------------------------------------


One bullish sign is that Paycom stock is near a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). That's an unusual pattern in which the consecutive weekly price change does not exceed 1% to 1.5%, either up or down in price.


Some three-weeks-tight patterns become four weeks in length. If a stock eventually breaks out in high volume after three or four weeks, investors already established in the stock can consider taking a position.


In this case, if the pattern holds up, new investors may want to jump in since it's so close to the company's breakout at 164.18. But such a move can be risky. Further, Paycom needs to finish no more than 1.5% above or below the closing price reached at the end of last week by the time Friday's close rolls around. It's now more than 3% below that threshold.


The provider of human-resources and payroll-processing software company has expanded its direct-sales strategy by adding regional offices. That has enabled it to take more customers from service bureaus **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)) and **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)).


Paycom adjusted earnings climbed 19% to $2.67 a share in 2018 as revenue rose 31% to $566 million.


Paycom Customer Loyalty A Bullish Sign
--------------------------------------


The software maker has upped spending on a national marketing campaign. It also plans to spend more on research and development.


In 2019, analysts estimate earnings growth of 18% to $3.16 a share. In 2020, profit growth is expected to re-accelerate to 27% to $4.01.


Paycom has forecast revenue growth of 26% to about $711 million in 2019.


One reason some analysts are bullish on Paycom stock is customer loyalty. Retention increased to 92% in 2018, up from 91% the prior year.


Paycom's focus on getting clients to increase usage of its software platform by employees could improve retention even more, says a Jefferies analyst. Paycom's customers benefit if human resources management is freed up to deal with strategic tasks, said Jefferies analyst Samad Samana, in a report to clients.

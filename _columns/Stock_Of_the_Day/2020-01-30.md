The company held its initial public offering in June 2012, pricing Splunk stock at 17. Shares more than doubled on their first day of trading.


Splunk Stock Breaks Out
-----------------------


Splunk stock broke out of a nearly six-month consolidation phase on Nov. 22, a Friday, and broke through a buy point of 143.80 the following Monday. Splunk stock continued to climb, hitting a record high of 161.49 on Jan. 17.


Shares of Splunk climbed 2% to close at 158.69 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The stock has pulled back 3% from its high but is currently getting support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), which is bullish. It becomes a buy if Splunk stock bounces solidly off the 10-week line in high volume and moves above its previous high. In this scenario, Splunk is a buy at 161.59, with the buy point extending to 169.67.


Another bullish signal is that Splunk's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is inching toward a one-year high. The stock is well above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).

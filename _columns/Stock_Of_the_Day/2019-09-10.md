Semiconductor equipment maker **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the company deftly manages the current chip industry down cycle. AMAT stock is nearing a buy point.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMAT stock slid 0.9% to close at 50.19. It has formed a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 52.52. The chart pattern is actually a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/), because the low of the current base just undercut the buy point of a previous cup base.


With Tuesday's action, Applied Materials stock could be [forming a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), which would offer a slightly lower buy point.


In addition to the [bullish base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) is pointing higher, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), a positive sign.

Applied Materials Ranks Eighth In Group
---------------------------------------


Santa Clara, Calif.-based Applied Materials is one of 34 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. It currently ranks No. 8 in the group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-applied-materials-inc-amat.aspx). AMAT stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.


Industry peers with better Composite Ratings include **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)).


Two More Quarters Of Sales, Earnings Declines Forecast
------------------------------------------------------


On Aug. 15, Applied Materials reported [fiscal third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applied-materials-earnings-q3-2019-beat-amat-stock-rises/) and sales that beat expectations. It provided in-line guidance for the current quarter.


The chip-gear giant earned an adjusted 74 cents a share on sales of $3.56 billion in the quarter ended July 28. Analysts expected earnings of 70 cents a share on sales of $3.53 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. On a year-over-year basis, earnings fell 38% while sales dropped 20%.


It was the third straight quarter of declining sales and earnings as Applied Materials navigates the current down cycle in the semiconductor sector.


Analysts forecast two more quarters of declines before Applied Materials returns to growth, Zacks said.


Positive Catalysts Through Mid-2020
-----------------------------------


On Sept. 3, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse reiterated his outperform rating on AMAT stock and raised his price target to 56 from 50.


In a report, Muse said he sees several positive catalysts from now through mid-2020 that should drive shares higher.


Those catalysts include expected equipment purchases by customers Samsung and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). Applied Materials also should benefit from incremental chip-gear market share gains and a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment, Muse said.

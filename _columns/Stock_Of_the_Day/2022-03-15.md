**CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The pharmacy operator is offering investors two buying opportunities. CVS stock rose Tuesday.




Drugstore chains have benefited from the Covid-19 pandemic as health and wellness became a top priority. CVS administered more than 32 million Covid tests and 59 million vaccines last year.


CVS has steadily expanded its grasp across the health care space. It bought insurance provider Aetna in 2018. In 2007, it bought Caremark, then the country's third-largest pharmacy benefits managers and the largest U.S. mail-order prescription business. CVS plans to open more HealthHUB locations to offer access to doctors, dietitians and social workers, both in-person and online.


Competitor **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) is also expanding and plans to open more VillageMD primary care operations at stores. However, in January the company reportedly begin searching for parties interested in its Boots international drugstore chain. Estimates have valued the business as high as $9.6 billion.


Covid-19 vaccines and tests are likely to remain key health care offerings in the coming year as the virus moves from the pandemic to the endemic phase. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) is reportedly looking for emergency authorization for a second booster shot for people age 65 and older, according to multiple news reports. The shot could eventually become a yearly necessity, like the flu shot.


CVS Stock Action
----------------


Shares climbed 2.5% to 106.98 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). CVS stock is coming out of several weeks of very tight trading in which it has hugged its 10-week moving average. The stock jumped up from that support, topping a March 7 high of 106.81. More experienced investors can use that as an alternative entry point.


The gain moved CVS stock up the right side of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 111.35 entry point.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at new highs. That can be a bullish sign, corroborating a breakout.



CVS Stock Fundamentals
----------------------


CVS reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales last month that topped Wall Street estimates. But the pharmacy's [2022 guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/cvs-health-earnings-beat-but-guidance-is-tepid-cvs-stock-slips/) suggested a slight earnings decline vs. 2021.

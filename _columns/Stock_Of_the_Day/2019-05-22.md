Twitter is a social media service that allows users to post and interact with messages known as "tweets." It's a go-to source of updates for live events, such as sports, news and entertainment. It's frequently used by public figures, including entertainers and politicians. President Donald Trump uses it almost daily.


Twitter ended the first quarter with 330 million monthly active users. That's above expectations for 319 million and up from 321 million in the prior quarter.


Twitter Stock Checkup
---------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows that Twitter has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The rating ranks key performance metrics and technical strength.


Twitter stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 90, which reflects strong [stock market performance.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/) has been trending higher. It also has a stellar 99 [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1), which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth against all other stocks.


Twitter is a recent addition to [IBD's Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).


Possibly adding some juice to the stock is a report from Bloomberg Tuesday afternoon. The report said Twitter is experimenting with increases in advertisements, its main source of revenue. Twitter acknowledged it's experimenting with more ad loads but provided no further details.


Twitter currently holds the No. 3 ranking among its peers in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is first, followed by **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)). The group ranks 64th among 197 sectors in recent performance.


Twitter is No. 12 in the [IBD 50 list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) of top-performing companies.


For the current quarter, Twitter expects revenue in the range of $770 million to $830 million. The midpoint of $800 million is up 12.5% from the year-ago period. The company expects operating income in the range of $35 million to $70 million.


Twitter Product Improvements
----------------------------


"We made a number of product improvements in the first quarter, including the launch of a public prototype app, with an initial focus on making Twitter more conversational, and a new Twitter camera to more easily capture and share what's happening," the company said in its [letter to shareholders](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2019/q1/Q1-2019-Shareholder-Letter.pdf).


Twitter held its initial public offering in 2013, pricing shares at 26.


Last month, Twitter unveiled 13 new and expanded content deals. These included a new partnership with Univision, an extension of Twitter's contract with the National Football League and a new and exclusive concert series that will be hosted by Live Nation on Twitter.


"We are encouraged by the company's continued efforts to deepen its relationships with media partners and drive engagement and conversations around live events," wrote Nomura analyst Mark Kelley in a recent research note to clients. He has a neutral rating on Twitter stock.

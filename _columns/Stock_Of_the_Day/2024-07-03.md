Q2 Earnings Report Coming Soon
------------------------------

ASML Stock On Two IBD Lists
---------------------------


On Wednesday, Bernstein analyst Sara Russo reiterated her outperform rating on ASML stock with a price target of 1,052.


Russo said she is confident that ASML will reach the high end of its bookings goal for 2025.


"ASML has been clear since late 2023 that 2024 would be a transition year," Russo said in a client note. "It's looking like first-half 2024 is shaping up to be as expected and reflects the softer bookings of last year. But early signs of bookings stabilization (with both memory and non-EUV bookings strengthening) could signal a better outlook for second-half 2024 and underpin the strong growth expected for 2025."

**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the social media company broke out to a nearly two-year high Friday and moved into a buy zone.




Snap stock jumped 4.7% to close at 19.11 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), climbing above its buy point of 18.46. The buy zone extends to 19.38.


Based in Santa Monica, Calif., Snap is the owner of [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/). It's a smartphone app that can manipulate and enhance photos and videos that can then be sent to other Snapchat users. The messaging platform is highly popular with the under-30 crowd and competes mostly with the Instagram platform of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


On Friday, Snap was upgraded to a buy from neutral by UBS analyst Eric Sheridan, who also raised his price target on Snap stock to 24, from 16. Sheridan cited expectations of strong revenue growth.

Price Target Raised On Snap Stock
---------------------------------


"We see Snap exiting 2019 with positive business momentum in terms of both ad revenue and user growth and expect such momentum to persist in 2020," Sheridan wrote in a note to clients. "We see a renewed management team focused on driving a mix of user growth (especially the Android refresh) and ad monetization that could produce multiyear revenue growth even above our newly raised forecasts."


Snap scored big with its eye-catching initial public offering in 2017 that raised $3.4 billion and gave it a market valuation of $23.8 billion. That made [Snap the largest U.S.-listed IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) among tech companies since Facebook. But the party didn't last long as Snap stock plunged the following day and continued falling for months.


Snap has been under constant assault from Facebook, which copied most of [Snapchat's best features](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-instagram-group-video-chat/) and added them to its Instagram Stories platform.


The company has spent much of the past year restructuring and [developing new products](https://investor.snap.com/news-releases/2019/09-25-2019-140934302) for its Snapchat platform. Snap also is drawing in more advertisements.


Snap's Path To Profitability
----------------------------


Snap revenue has grown at a steady double-digit pace but the company has yet to show a profit.


Last week, two Wall Street analysts [delivered optimistic reports](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-jumps-ad-growth-user-trends-profitability/) that said Snap is showing accelerating user growth, positive advertising trends and a path to profitability. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded Snap to buy from hold. He says Snap now has a clearer path to profitability.


When Snap reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 4, Thill thinks it will achieve a break-even point for the first time on the basis of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA.


Snap ended [its third quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-third-quarter-earnings-report-beats-estimates/) with 210 million daily active users, after adding 7 million new users. That beat Wall Street expectations of 4 million new users.


Technical Analysis On Snap
--------------------------


A technical analysis of Snap stock is a key component of [determining whether it's worth buying](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-or-sell-large-cap-stocks/).


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-inc-tsla.aspx) shows that Snap currently has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 93 out of a best-possible 99. It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 97. The rating shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in IBD's database.


Snap stock also trades above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) moving average.


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near a record high, a good sign ahead of a breakout. The relative strength line compares a stock's price action with that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line means the stock is lagging.

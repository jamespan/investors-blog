**Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of tracking chips holds strong during the recent stock market correction. Still, PI stock dipped on Tuesday.




Meanwhile, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for PI stock is in record-high territory as it outperforms the S&P 500.


Also, PI stock has found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


PI stock is [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 99.10. However, a clear break above its recent pullback could offer an early entry.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), PI stock dropped 2.5% to close at 89.66 during an overall down day for stocks.


PI Stock Gets Buy Rating
------------------------


Seattle-based Impinj makes tiny tracking chips that can connect items to the internet cloud for customers in retail, transportation, logistics and other industries. It uses a wireless technology called [Rain RFID](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/impinj-promotes-rain-rfid-tracking-technology/). RFID stands for radio-frequency identification. The Rain flavor of RFID also derives its name from radio-frequency identification.


On Monday, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated his buy rating on PI stock. Impinj executives presented at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference last week.


At the conference, executives noted that retailer **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is expanding its deployment of RFID chips from apparel to home goods and other merchandise. Hari called this a "significant development given Walmart's position as a bellwether in the industry and thus we expect to see peers follow suit."


Impinj Ranks Third In Industry Group
------------------------------------


PI stock surged to a record high of 99 on Aug. 12 after its beat-and-raise [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220727005849/en/).


Impinj earned an adjusted 11 cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier, on sales of $59.8 million, up 27%, in the June quarter.


For the current quarter, Impinj predicts adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share on sales of $64.5 million. That's based on the midpoint of its outlook. In the third quarter last year, it lost 4 cents a share on sales of $45.2 million.


"Based on my conversations with Impinj's leading end users and go-to-market partners, I expect demand to remain strong at least through second-half 2022, driven by both new deployments and expansion at existing deployments," Chief Executive Chris Diorio said on the company's second-quarter earnings call.


Impinj stock ranks third out of 34 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group. PI stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 82 out of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-impinj-inc-pi.aspx). IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

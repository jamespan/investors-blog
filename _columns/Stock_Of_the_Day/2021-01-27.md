**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the software giant's cloud computing business continues to impress. Microsoft stock is in a buy zone after a breakout.




On Tuesday, Microsoft stock broke out of a 22-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 232.96, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. The [5% chase zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) of the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) extends to 244.61.


But on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Microsoft stock gave up much of its gains as the market slumped. By the close, shares ticked up 0.3% to 232.90, just below the buy point.


Late Tuesday, Microsoft delivered a beat-and-raise report for its [fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-q2-2021-microsoft-earnings/). The Redmond, Wash.-based company earned $2.03 a share, up 34% year over year, on sales of $43.08 billion, up 17%, in the December quarter. Analysts expected Microsoft earnings of $1.64 a share on sales of $40.18 billion.

Microsoft Stock: Accelerating Sales, Earnings Growth
----------------------------------------------------


The report marked Microsoft's second straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. It also was the company's fastest sales growth in nine quarters.


For the current quarter, Microsoft expects sales of $40.8 billion, up 16.5%, based on the midpoint of its outlook. Its guidance implied earnings per share of $1.75, up 25%. Analysts predicted Microsoft earnings of $1.58 a share on sales of $38.7 billion in the March quarter.


Microsoft executives touted the strong performance of the company's cloud businesses, which include Azure and Office 365. In the second quarter, revenue from Microsoft's commercial cloud offerings rose 34% year over year to $16.7 billion.


Revenue from Azure cloud infrastructure services rose 50% in the period. That beat Wall Street's consensus estimate for 41% Azure growth. It also accelerated from 48% growth in the September quarter.


MSFT Stock Gets Price-Target Increases
--------------------------------------


[Microsoft stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) received a flurry of price-target hikes after its earnings news.


Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated his buy rating on Microsoft stock and upped his price target to 300 from 260.


"The biggest question is how much better can it get with Microsoft beating almost every single metric in the quarter," Thill said in a note to clients. "Microsoft appears primed for durable double-digit revenue and operating income growth on the back of its work-from-anywhere stack with Azure, Teams, security, Windows and gaming."


Raymond James analyst Robert Majek maintained his strong buy rating on Microsoft stock and raised his price target to 275 from 235.


Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan stuck with his outperform rating on Microsoft and increased his price target to 275 from 260.


"Cloud-based revenues now make up 44% of total revenues, and Microsoft has built the most complete suite of enterprise cloud services, which it can bundle together and cross-sell customers," Horan said in his note to clients. "Consumers' habits are also digitalizing, evidenced by gaming strength (up 51%). We believe we are only in the second inning of adoption and that cloud-based revenues will soon represent a majority of revenue and support consolidated 10%+ revenue growth."

**Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the royalty gold stock cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Tuesday amid a rally in prices for the precious metal.




[Royalty companies don't "dirty their hands" in the mining trade](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/the-best-way-to-play-next-gold-rally-may-be-neither-bullion-nor-miners/), as it were. Instead, they provide upfront capital to gold and silver miners and producers, receiving in return either a percentage of future sales as royalty or a stream of precious metals at discounted prices.


As stock market volatility and a weakening dollar burnishes the appeal of gold stocks overall, rival royalty stocks **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPM)) and **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)) are also setting up in bases.


U.S. Global Investors, which operates the Gold & Precious Metals Fund ([USERX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USERX)), has been especially bullish on royalty stocks like Franco-Nevada, saying they share much of the upside with producers and explorers when gold prices rise — but little of the downside.


"Franco-Nevada has outperformed gold bullion and gold equities in both bull markets and bear markets," U.S. Global Investors CEO Frank Holmes wrote in his popular [Frank Talk blog](http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/supercharge-your-gold-position-with-precious-metal-royalty-companies/) Dec. 9.


"Investors who like gold do so because they understand that the yellow metal can limit losses in their equity position and reduce volatility. Adding a royalty company such as Franco-Nevada to the mix can be like injecting nitro into your souped-up sports car."


Many analysts recommend gold for its portfolio diversification benefits. Holmes recommends a 10% allocation to gold at all times, with 5% in physical gold and the other 5% in gold stocks. "But to supercharge your portfolio, I would strongly consider" royalty companies like Franco-Nevada stock, he adds.

Franco-Nevada Stock
-------------------


Shares closed up 1.8% at 101.36 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), topping a 101.30 cup-with-handle [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and hitting a new high intraday as gold prices hit a seven-week high after mixed economic data Monday.


Franco-Nevada stock is also 5% above the 50-day line and 17% above the 200-day line in a second-stage pattern, [MarketSmith analysis](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-4weeksfor2495&src=A00365A) shows. Volume on the breakout is light, but a 40% rise in volume may be a tough ask in a short Christmas Eve session.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks Franco-Nevada stock's performance against the S&P 500, has moved sideways for much of the last three months and is not making a new high along with the stock. It's the blue line in the chart provided.


The overall [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) on Franco-Nevada stock, combining key fundamental and technical metrics, is a superior 97 out of 99. It's also the highest of 62 stocks in the Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems industry group, one of 197 groups tracked by IBD.



Franco-Nevada's earnings growth averaged 34% in the past three quarters, accelerating from flat to 17% to 86%. The three-year EPS growth rate is 14%. Sales growth averaged 16% in the last three quarters, going from 4% to 6% to 38%. The three-year sales growth rate is 4%.


Recent momentum looks set to continue: Analysts expect a 44% EPS increase in all of fiscal 2019, followed by a 25% gain in fiscal 2020.


Franco-Nevada earnings have benefited in part from expansion in Latin America. The company has also been adding to its U.S. energy assets. Delivering a Q3 beat Nov. 11, Franco-Nevada cited the start of gold and silver deliveries from its new Cobre Panama property, as well as a new energy royalty acquisition in the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast.


Royalty Gold Stocks Rally
-------------------------


Among other gold royalty stocks, Wheaton Precious Metals stock jumped 3.65% to 29.54 Tuesday, eyeing a cup-shaped entry at 31. It is a third-stage base, which requires caution.


Royal Gold stock advanced 2.2% to 120.55, but still well below a 138.88 buy point. Shares are just back above the 50-day line, which is trending downward.


Gold stocks gained as the U.S. dollar, as tracked by Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)), fell to a multimonth low. Gold and the dollar tend to move in opposite directions.

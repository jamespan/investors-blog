GM stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the U.S. auto giant briefly topped a buy point Thursday. [Strong third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/auto-sales-gm-ford-to-lead-q3-rebound-but-challenges-persist/) eased fears of a slowdown.


On Oct. 26, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) disclosed a 48% earnings gain for the third quarter, recovering from a 42% Q2 decline as supply-chain issues improved. It also promised to discuss the "rapid scaling of our EV portfolio" at an investor day on Nov. 17.


Investors had been worried that a shaky U.S. and global economy could hurt demand for new vehicles. But GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Oct. 26: "We haven't seen any direct impact on our products. Pricing remains strong. Demand remains strong."


GM also backed full-year earnings targets after its Q3 earnings beat. Rival **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) guided to the low end of its prior earnings range for the full year.


Both GM and Ford, with other traditional automakers, continue ramping up their focus on electric vehicles to catch up with **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). But they face complex headwinds, from chip and other supply shortages to a worsening macroeconomic outlook.


**Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)), a lithium supplier for EV batteries to Tesla and other EV companies, is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/) while **SQM** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)), another lithium play on global EV adoption, belongs to the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top growth stocks.


GM stock was added to the [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) list on Thursday as it broke above a recent downtrend. It's probably the best-looking EV stock right now, above key technical levels while Tesla is far below.

Electric Vehicles, Inflation Reduction Act
------------------------------------------


The [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows that GM stock is middling in terms of key IBD ratings. It earns a 56 [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), 52 [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) and a 59 [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1), all out of a best-possible 99.


But the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes domestic manufacturing of electric cars. And Wall Street sees both GM and Tesla as having a competitive advantage due to their preexisting EV production footprint in the U.S.


GM stock earns an average rating of overweight from 20 analysts, FactSet shows.

GM Stock, EV Stocks
-------------------


Shares of General Motors advanced 4.3% to 39.70 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). GM stock topped a 40.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) from a cup-with-handle base intraday, regaining its 200-day moving average. It closed below the entry but held above the 200-day line.


GM stock was already actionable from breaking a downtrend in the handle. On Thursday, stocks at large rallied strongly on positive inflation data.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for GM stock is rising within a longer-term downtrend, the [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows. A rising RS line means a stock is outperforming vs. the S&P 500.


A 52 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) means that GM stock has outperformed 52% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.


Its 52 RS Rating compares with a 15 for Tesla stock and 39 for Ford stock.


The auto industry group is lagging at 146th place out of [the 197 groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-nov-09-2022/).


General Motors Earnings
-----------------------


In the September quarter, [GM earnings surged 48%](https://www.investors.com/news/auto-sales-gm-ford-to-lead-q3-rebound-but-challenges-persist/) as revenue jumped 56%. That reflected easy earnings and revenue comparisons, with sharp declines seen in the year-ago quarter.


A shortage of auto microchips triggered largely by factors related to the pandemic weighed on automakers in the past year. Vehicle suppliers were unable to keep up with robust demand.


Analysts polled by FactSet see GM earnings rising 1% for the full year. They see revenue growing 21% in all of 2022. But they forecast an 18% EPS decline in fiscal 2023 as revenue gains slow to 4%.


Thus far in 2022, strong vehicle pricing has helped automakers like GM offset lower sales volumes.


But supply headwinds could turn into demand headwinds as interest rates rise. Next year, pricing may weaken even as supply disruptions ease and volumes increase.

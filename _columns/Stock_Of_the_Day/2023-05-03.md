AeroVironment Wins Amid Ukraine War
-----------------------------------


On May 2, AeroVironment announced a $10 million contract award by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to design and develop Mars Sample Recovery Helicopter flight systems.


On April 26, the company said it received an additional $64.6 million contract by the U.S. Army for Switchblade 300 loitering missile systems.


The new contract includes foreign military sales for the first time to France and another allied nation, expanding AeroVironment's international footprint, the company said.


In 2022, the U.S. government approved the tiny and lethal Switchblade systems for use by Ukraine after Russia invaded its neighboring country.


The Switchblade 300 weighs less than five pounds and can be launched in less than two minutes from a tube, providing real-time video intelligence from the air.


Dubbed a "kamikaze drone" or "suicide drone," the Switchblade loiters in the air until a target is identified, then acts as a precision-guided missile to deliver its deadly payload.


Strong IBD Ratings
------------------


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.aspx) tool, AVAV stock earns an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 83 out of a best-possible 99.


The Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


AeroVironment's 90 RS Rating means that it has outperformed 90% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.


Earnings have been volatile in recent quarters. Analysts polled by FactSet expect AeroVironment earnings to jump 65% per share in fiscal 2024, which just began in May.


That would follow what looks to be a flat 2023. AeroVironment hasn't reported fiscal Q4 results yet. Wall Street expects a big gain after fiscal Q3 earnings rose a mild 6% with revenue up 49%. That followed two quarters of mild losses.

**Hain Celestial** ([HAIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAIN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The organic and natural foods company delivered an earnings comeback as the pandemic spurs healthy eating and wellness trends. Hain stock is near a buy point.




After exiting brands with low margins and low growth, Hain's spectrum of products now includes Terra vegetable chips, Celestial Seasonings tea, Health Valley cereal bars and The Greek Gods yogurt.


Hain Earnings Outlook
---------------------


After four years of declines, Hain delivered earnings growth in 2020 on the back of a restructuring effort. It also has been taking out costs and optimizing its manufacturing footprint.


"When we started our transformation two years ago, we said that we would begin by showing immediate progress on margins with lower sales, as we eliminated unprofitable brands, SKUs and low-ROI investments," CEO Mark Schiller said on a Feb. 9 earnings call. "The result would be a smaller, more profitable company that was ready to grow again. As you know, we have delivered and exceeded on those expectations."


Over the past five quarters, Hain earnings growth accelerated from 42% to 238% before slowing to a still-booming 100%. Over the same period, sales growth went from -5% to 4%.


Wall Street expects Hain earnings to jump 63% to $1.37 per share in all of 2021 despite revenue falling 2% to $2.01 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. It sees further 16% EPS growth in 2022 as sales eke out a 0.5% gain.


The recent history of struggles weighs on key ratings from IBD. Hain has a poor [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 69 out of 99 and an [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=SMR+Rating&termid=1) of C, on a scale of A+ to a worst E.


But its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Accumulation%2fDistribution+(Acc%2fDis)+Rating&termid=1) is a different story. It's a superior A-, and a sign that big institutions have been heavy net buyers of Hain stock over the past 13 weeks.


In addition, Hain stock shows seven quarters of increasing fund ownership. More than 570 funds owned shares as of December, up 5% from September.


After two years of restructuring, Hain is growing the bottom line, improving margins and seeing demand for its more streamlined range of products. Seven analysts rate Hain stock a buy, three have a hold and none has a sell, per Zacks.


Hain Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares dipped 1.3% to 43.99 in Friday's trading. That's slightly below the 45.52 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) after successfully testing the 10-week line, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) stretches back to late January and follows a big rally for Hain stock from March 2020 coronavirus lows.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has moved higher for months and is just below January highs on a daily chart. On a weekly chart, the RS line hit its highest level since April 2018. MarketSmith gives stocks in bases or breaking out a blue shaded dot at the end of RS lines that are hitting 52-wekek highs


A rising RS line means Hain stock is currently outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown and shows a longer-term downtrend.



On the technical front, too, key IBD ratings don't quite reflect Hain's transformation.


Hain holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 69 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That means it has outperformed 69% of all stocks in the past year.Â Its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is a dull 74.


The packaged-food group ranks a poor 161 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. The group includes giants such as **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) and **ConAgra** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)). More conventional and larger packaged-food companies have made inroads in the health and wellness market that Hain targets. **Simply Good Foods** ([SMPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMPL)) also develops and sells nutritional foods and snacks, and recently joined the [prestigious IBD Leaderboard list of stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/).


Hain Grows Around The Globe
---------------------------


In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended last December, Hain reported that both North America and international sales grew an adjusted 6%.


"Both North America and international delivered strong sales, profit and margin expansion, further demonstrating that our strategy is working across the globe and we have considerable momentum," CEO Schiller said on the Feb. 9 call.


In fiscal Q2, Hain expanded adjusted profit margins nearly 300 basis points to 11.8%. Despite pandemic uncertainty, Hain expects further margin improvement and profit growth for the year. But it held off on specific financial guidance.

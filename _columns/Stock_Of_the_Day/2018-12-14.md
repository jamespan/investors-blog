Payments giant **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it continues to show strength amid a difficult investing climate. But the Mastercard stock chart also underscores the weakness of the current choppy [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/).




Analysts are bullish on Mastercard growth. The shift toward digital payments mean there is growing demand for the Mastercard network. A coming shift in business-to-business payments offers a massive opportunity for Mastercard, archrival **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and many others.


Mastercard Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------------


Mastercard's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been trading near record highs. A strong RS line in a weak market helps identify leaders and stocks that might do well in a healthy rally. But Mastercard stock's RS line also highlights the weakness of the S&P 500 index and broader markets. 


Mastercard stock fell 1.8% to 195.33 Friday, falling below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/) after hitting resistance at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) earlier in the week. But Mastercard stock is consolidating reasonably well, only 13% off its Oct. 1 peak. It still has a valid 210.01 handle buy point, though the midpoint of the handle is just above the midpoint of the base.



The S&P 500 index, meanwhile, lost 1.9% in Friday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) for its lowest close in eight months. This is not a good time to be buying new stocks. But Mastercard stock and many payments stocks peers are worth watching for the next uptrend.

Mastercard Earnings, Fundamentals Solid
---------------------------------------


While earnings have not been accelerating, they have been growing at a double-digit clip for the past seven quarters. Revenue has also been following the same pattern.


Mastercard stock boasts a 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) out of 99. It's in second place in the [Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-13-2018/) group, behind only **Green Dot Financial** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)) and ahead of Dow Jones component Visa stock, PayPal stock and other highly-rated group peers.


Mastercard stock is on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), along with Visa stock and PayPal stock.


Visa stock fell 1.7% to 135.14 intraday, fighting to hold its 200-day line. PayPal stock dipped 1.35% to 86.38, still above its 50-day line and close to a 88.94 handle buy point.


Mastercard Stock Leads In Europe
--------------------------------


Back in September Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider said the top stock will benefit from increasing share in the "underpenetrated" European market. He also believes it is perfectly poised to lead in the untapped business-to-business payments market.


"We continue to see upside to Street estimates over the next 12 months driven by core consumer volume and exposure to Europe and other growth markets," he said in a research note. "In addition, we believe the B2B market represents the next growth horizon for the payments industry and think Mastercard is the best positioned given its multifaceted product approach."


B2B payments have been lagging when it comes to adoption of digital payment methods. However that seems to be changing, and this is seen as [offering a $950 billion annualized opportunity for payment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/?preview_id=3729964).

Bullish Indicators On SS&C Stock
--------------------------------


With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), SS&C holds the No. 1 ranking among financial software and fintech stocks. And with three straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth, the company currently holds the top spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of leading growth stocks that show strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals.


On another bullish note, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has stretched to new highs after a breakout from a first-stage base.


Headquartered in Windsor, Conn., SS&C claims more than 13,000 financial services and health care organizations as its clients. They include everyone from the world's largest institutions to local firms, which manage and account for their investments using SS&C products and services.


SS&C, which stands for securities software and consulting, was founded in 1986 by Bill Stone. He has remained the company's chief executive and chairman since its inception.


"Looking forward we see significant opportunities throughout the world," SS&C Chief Executive Bill Stone told analysts when the company reported fourth-quarter results on Feb. 14. "Our core business remains strong, with solid organic revenue growth and margin expansion contributing to our earnings beat."


Four Quarters Of Earnings Acceleration
--------------------------------------


SS&C has posted four quarters of accelerating earnings growth. The company handily beat estimates when it reported fourth-quarter results. Acquisitions helped boost revenue to $1.1 billion, up 153% from the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings grew 76% to 95 cents per share. SS&C stock jumped 6% on the earnings report.


In 2018, total revenue more than doubled from the prior year to $3.42 billion. Adjusted earnings rose 50% to $2.90 per share.


The company first went public in 1996. In November 2005, it was acquired by entities affiliated with Carlyle Group and taken private. SS&C then returned to the public market in March 2010. It has more than 22,000 employees worldwide.


Last year, SS&C spent more than $8 billion on DST Systems, Eze Software and Intralinks. The largest of those was DST, at $5.4 billion.


DST is a strategic advisory, technology, and operations outsourcing company for financial services and health care businesses. Eze Software serves asset managers, including hedge fund managers and asset owner clients. Intralinks is a leading financial technology provider for the global banking, deal making and capital markets communities.


UBS analyst Alex Kramm recently raised his price target on SS&C stock to 65 from 60 and maintained a buy rating.


"We believe the market is vastly under-appreciating SS&C's ability to deliver on results and grow the bottom line, whether that is organically or through M&A," Kramm wrote in a note to clients.

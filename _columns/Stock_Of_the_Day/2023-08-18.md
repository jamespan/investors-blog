**Diamond Offshore Drilling** ([DO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Friday. DO stock cleared an early buy point after already rising more than 50% in 2023. Diamond Offshore is benefiting from rebounding earnings and strong demand as oil prices trade around a one-year high.




Oil Prices Rose 7 Weeks In Row
------------------------------


U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.9% to $81.07 per barrel intraday Friday. Prices slumped 2.4% for the week, oil's first weekly decline in eight weeks. West Texas Intermediate futures [surged to year-highs last Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/slb-stock-drills-for-gains-as-oil-hit-12-month-highs/) amid growing concerns of low supply.


Diamond Offshore provides contract drilling services for the energy industry. The Houston-based company operates a fleet of 12 offshore drilling rigs around the globe, eight semisubmersibles and four drill ships, according to its website.


For its Q2 report on Aug. 7, Diamond Offshore reported a 37% revenue jump to $281.56 million. It was the second straight quarter of accelerating earnings and beat estimates of $272.4 million. Earnings soared to $2.29 per share from a 22-cent loss a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a loss of 14 cents per share.


The company's backlog ballooned by $229 million for the quarter, bringing the total to $1.6 billion.


For 2023, Diamond Offshore expects total revenue to increase about 13% to a range of $950 million to $960 million amid the rising oil prices. The company guided adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) between $105 and $120 million, compared to $35 million last year.


FactSet sees full-year EBITDA at $147 million on $1.03 billion in revenue.


DO stock ranks third in the Oil & Gas-Drilling group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Rival **Noble** ([NE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NE)) leads the group.


The market is in a correction, so investors should be cautious about new buys generally. But oil stocks are holding up with crude oil prices strong.

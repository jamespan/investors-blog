**MKS Instruments** ([MKSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKSI)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of semiconductor manufacturing gear breaks out from a double-bottom base. MKSI stock moved into a buy zone after it withdrew from a bidding war for **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)), a maker of laser components used in displays, chip manufacturing and other applications.




A [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) looks sort of like the letter "W." It features two distinct sell-offs. After the second sell-off, the stock finds its footing again.


In the case of MKS stock, it zigzagged as investors mulled the possibility it would outbid rivals for Coherent. MKS, though, retreated while **Ii-Vi** ([IIVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIVI)) and **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)), battled for Coherent.


Coherent on Wednesday said Lumentum has upped its offer to $6.9 billion, topping Ii-Vi's $6.4 billion bid. Lumentum also added more cash to its offer.


Shares in Andover, Mass.-based MKS now trade in a buy zone, above an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 177.46. MKSI stock on Tuesday rose 3.4%, closing at 177.91.

MKS Stock: Chip Equipment Makers Back In Favor
----------------------------------------------


IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group [ranks No. 25 out of 197 groups tracked](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-12-2021/). Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases chances of making profits in growth stocks.


Cowen analyst Krish Sankar in a recent note to clients said that MKS has expanded through debt-funded acquisitions, notably purchasing Newport Lasers in 2016 and ESI in 2018. While Sankar had called those two deals "transformational," he predicted at the time that MKS would not overpay for Coherent.


MKS is a global supplier of instruments, subsystems and control solutions that measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes, according to the Cowen analyst. Components from its vacuum and analysis division are a critical subsystem in semiconductor etch deposition tools.


Meanwhile, the "Newport acquisition was a key driver of its industrial laser, photonics, and optics business," said Sankar.


MKS Earnings Growth Accelerates
-------------------------------



In 2020, MKS per-share earnings growth accelerated from 38% in the first quarter to 49%, 72% and 95% in the June, September and December quarters. Revenue rose 16% in the March quarter, followed by 15%, 28% and 32% growth in the next three quarters.


MKS initially bid for Coherent last month, on Feb. 8. The company upped its offer for Coherent on March 5.


Coherent's board of directors, though, said it viewed Ii-Vi's offer as superior to those of Lumentum and MKS. The takeover battle is ongoing, without MKS.


"We continue to believe that MKS is the best partner for Coherent, and our analysis with respect to synergies, leverage, and dilution gives us confidence that the near- and long-term value creation of our offer exceeds that of the competing offers," Chief Executive John Lee said in a March 8 news release. "However, we remain disciplined acquirers."


MKS garners 60% of revenue from semiconductor products and 40% from products used in advanced electronics, industrial and life sciences manufacturing.


"Activity is driven by a combination of the red-hot logic/foundry segments and a recovering memory market on the (semiconductor) side, augmented by a nice research-driven, double-digit, uptick in the advanced markets," D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely said in a note. "The main investor concern is now calling the cyclical peak as a key (original equipment manufacturer) customer projects 2021 business will be first-half weighted. However, we remain bullish on continued WFE (wafer fab equipment) growth in the years ahead."


Precision Laser Applications Grow
---------------------------------


On its third quarter earnings call, CEO Lee called out laser manufacturing as a strategic focus.


"Five years ago, precision lasers were used mainly for smartphone electronics and solar panel manufacturing," Lee said. "Now we are seeing precision laser processing expand to wearables, tablets, autonomous vehicles and many other electronic devices."


In addition, Lee said the types of laser-based processes being deployed for precision manufacturing have expanded rapidly.

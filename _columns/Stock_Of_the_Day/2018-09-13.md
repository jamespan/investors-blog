**Ceridian HCM** ([CDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDAY)), a provider of human capital management services with designs on making work life better, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


The company went public on April 26 and its stock chart already displays movements typical of a healthy [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). In this formation, the stock forms a U shape but there's a brief contraction as shares approach new highs. This dip — a pullback typically no deeper than 12% and at least a week long — acts as a final shakeout of weak holders. It's called a handle.


The Ceridian stock handle is trading above its 10-week moving average in below-average trading volume; both are positive signs. On Thursday, Ceridian shares closed at 37.18, up 1.75%.

Ceridian stock bears a close watch, though, as it shows a weak [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1) of 52 out of a possible 99. As is typical of companies with a recent IPO, Ceridian has yet to show a profit.


Finding Growth With Dayforce
----------------------------


The software maker's core product is Dayforce. It's a cloud-based platform that companies use to help manage their human resources, payroll, benefits and workforce.


Ceridian had 3,308 customers on Dayforce at the end of the second quarter. It says Dayforce revenue has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of greater than 60% since 2012.


The company got its start in 1992 as an information services company. In 2007, an investment group acquired it. In 2012 Ceridian acquired Dayforce, the maker of its namesake software. Ceridian named Dayforce founder David Ossip as its chief executive.


"We believed that every area of the human capital management market could be disrupted," Ossip wrote in a letter published in the [Ceridian IPO prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1725057/000119312518094908/d511403ds1.htm). "A unified platform with a single source of data and predictive analytics would change the game."


Ceridian held its initial public offering on April 26, pricing shares at 22 each. Ceridian stock soared 42% on its first day of trading. The IPO raised $462 million by offering 21 million shares at 22, above the estimated pricing range of 19 to 21. The stock hit a record high of 42.46 on June 18. It has since formed a healthy-looking cup with handle with a buy point of 39.45.

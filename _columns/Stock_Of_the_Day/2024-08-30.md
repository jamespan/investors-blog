**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of computer networking gear gets a lift from customers splurging on data-center equipment for artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, ANET stock is near a buy point.




After a rocky ride following its [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/arista-stock-arista-earnings-june2024/) on July 30, ANET stock seems to have found its footing. Arista Networks stock now is approaching a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 358.68 from a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-how-to-spot-a-good-one/), based on [IBD analysis](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/).


That formation is within an eight-week [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) that offers a follow-on buy point of 376.50, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. That secondary buy point is also the all-time high for ANET stock, reached on July 9.


In a positive sign, ANET stock has found support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/).


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), ANET stock gained 2% to close at 353.38.


Sales Growth Decelerating
-------------------------


In the June quarter, Arista Networks beat Wall Street's targets for sales and earnings. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $2.10 a share, up 33% year over year, on sales of $1.69 billion, up 16%. But sales growth decelerated for the sixth straight quarter.


For the current quarter, Arista forecast sales of $1.735 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts had been looking for $1.73 billion.


"Arista highlighted strong momentum in customer AI interest with projects moving from trial to pilots," Needham analyst Alex Henderson said in a client note July 31. He rates ANET stock as buy with a price target of 375.


ANET Stock Is On Two IBD Lists
------------------------------


Arista sells computer network switches that speed up communications in internet data centers. Its chief rivals are **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)). It also [competes with AI powerhouse](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-arista-networks-ai-networking-battle/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which sells Spectrum-X Ethernet switches.


Arista has projected $750 million in artificial-intelligence-related revenue for 2025. Internet data centers will need more computing power and network bandwidth to process AI workloads.


"At this point, Arista's target for $750 million for 2025 AI revenue looks so conservative, all we can do is smile," Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes said in a client note July 31. "We reiterate our buy rating for Arista given prospects for further enterprise share gains and significant AI upside still lies ahead."


Reitzes has a price target on ANET stock of 375.


ANET stock is on two IBD stock lists: [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Tech Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-tech-leaders-aug-29-2024/).

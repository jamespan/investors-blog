**Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the owner of the Tinder dating app rebounded bullishly off its 50-day moving average. Match stock trades mainly on Tinder paid subscriber growth, with analysts expecting a boost from expansion in Asia.




Shares in Match have shot up 75% from a year ago despite **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) moving aggressively into dating connections. Facebook in May said it plans to expand a dating offering to 14 countries in 2019, up from three last year.


Match stock popped 7% to 71.48 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?), rebounding from its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. That offers a follow-on buy opportunity for existing shareholders. With the gain, Match stock is trading roughly 5% below a flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 75.38.


Tinder App Downloads Strong
---------------------------


Downloads of the Tinder app on smartphones, a metric watched by Wall Street analysts, helped spark Monday's rally.


"Our data checks for Tinder continue to look strong. With less than a week remaining in the quarter, Q2 U.S. app rankings have come in above both Q1 2019 and 2018 quarterly levels," said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a report. "The data isn't perfect on a year-over-year basis, but Tinder's consistency and staying power give us confidence in continued execution."

The company gets nearly half its revenue from the Tinder app, though it's also still available as a free app. Match's revenue growth comes from premium versions that provide extra dating features.


Dallas-based Match continues to add features to the Tinder app, most recently allowing users to post video snippets. Overseas growth in markets such as India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea is key for Tinder and other products, analysts say.


Cultural Dating Taboos Disappearing In Asia
-------------------------------------------


Match Chief Executive Mandy Ginsberg explained its strategy in an article published in this year's [Harvard Business Review's July-August edition](https://hbr.org/2019/07/match-groups-ceo-on-innovating-in-a-fast-changing-industry).


"We're expanding in international markets where online dating is less mature," she wrote. "Markets across Asia tend to have lots of young singles with smartphones and evolving dating norms. For Indians of my generation, arranged marriages were common. That's changing."


"In Japan, until recently, a stigma was still attached to online dating," Ginsberg added. "We bought a brand called Pairs, which is the top app for serious dating in Japan, and it's been growing quickly. These markets are very exciting for us as we look to the future."


Match stock surged more than 12% on May 8 after earnings topped expectations as Tinder subscriber growth rebounded. The Match stock rally continued through May 16. Shares pulled back and formed a [second-stage flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/), touching their 50-day line on Friday.


On Monday, the stock bounced off the 50-day line and was put on [IBD's Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) as well as [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The stock action represents the first successful pullback to the line since Match's last breakout on April 15. That provides a follow-on buy area.


Adding Video Snippets To Tinder Dating App
------------------------------------------


Match in April hired Ravi Mehta as its new chief product officer. Mehta had served as Facebook's product director for youth engagement. At Facebook, he helped develop Lasso, a competitor to the popular TikTok short video sharing app.


In the HBR article, Ginsberg said Match is adding video to the Tinder app.


"Millennials post videos of themselves on Instagram and Snap, so they're naturally comfortable with the format," Ginsberg wrote. "We've begun allowing users to post video snippets on Tinder, where users tend to be younger. For our brands where users tend to be older and less comfortable posting videos of themselves, we're working to find more natural ways to let their personality come through on video without them feeling embarrassed."


The company said it added 384,000 paid Tinder subscribers in the March quarter. That topped the 233,000 Tinder subscribers added in the December quarter and 369,000 added in the year-earlier period.


Still, some analysts are cautious on the Match strategy. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng in May upgraded Match stock to neutral from sell.


Lower Tinder Pricing In Asian Markets
-------------------------------------


Ng expects lower average revenue per subscriber as Match targets international markets. He says the premium version of Tinder will be priced lower in markets like India.


Match revenue growth has slowed for the past three quarters.


Furthermore, Ng says Facebook's dating expansion is a long-term threat. In the U.S., he says there's a high rate of turnover for Tinder Gold, a premium-priced version of the app.


Many analysts focus on Match's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth. In the March quarter, EBITDA rose 13% to $155 million, just above estimates of $154.4 million.


Other Online Dating Sites
-------------------------


Aside from Tinder, Match operates online dating websites. Tinder is best known as a casual dating app. In early 2019, Match acquired full ownership of relationship-focused Hinge, a mobile app.


"There's an epidemic of loneliness in the world," Ginsberg said in the Harvard Business Review article. "People are beginning to understand the health implications of that, and we need to address it."


She added: "Even in a technology-driven society, people crave intimate connections, whether that means getting married or just sitting down together for coffee. We help people make those connections."


Media mogul Barry Diller's **IAC** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)) spun off Match Group in 2015. It still holds 80% of shares. IAC consolidates Match's financial results.

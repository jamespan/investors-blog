Three Core Businesses At Sea
----------------------------


Sea reported fiscal second-quarter results in August. Revenue soared 159% from the year-ago period to $2.28 billion, with an adjusted loss of 61 cents.


Sea breaks down into three core internet businesses — digital entertainment, e-commerce and financial services. The three units are called Garena, Shopee and SeaMoney, respectively.


Garena is a leading global online games developer and publisher. Quarterly active users on Garena grew 45% to 725.2 million, while paying users jumped 85% to 92.2 million. In addition, the company's top-ranked game, called "Free Fire," hit more than 1 billion downloads on Google Play. It also achieved a new record high of over 150 million peak daily active users in the quarter.


Shopee is the largest pan-regional e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, the company says. E-commerce revenue grew 161% from the year-ago period to $1.2 billion.


SeaMoney is a leading digital payments and financial services provider in Southeast Asia, according to the company. Its mobile wallet payment volume exceeded $4.1 billion for the second quarter, up 150% year over year.


**Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), one of China's largest internet companies, is a principal shareholder. A key competitor is China e-commerce giant **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)).

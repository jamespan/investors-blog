Human-resources outsourcing company **Insperity** ([NSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSP)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it works on a new base ahead of its quarterly report. Insperity earnings are expected to see another strong quarter of double-digit gains as revenue growth is projected to accelerate once again. Insperity stock jumped 11% on its last quarterly report in August.




Stock Of The Day: NSP
---------------------


Today's Stock Of The Day is shaping a flat base with a 121.25 buy point in a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/). Insperity stock fell 0.9% to 106.47 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), or about 11% below the buy point.


Watch for potential resistance at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3582283) as the stock climbs. That will be a key area for Insperity stock to clear as it continues toward the buy zone.


While the relative strength line is off its highs from early September, Insperity stock's RS rating is strong at 98 out of 99. The [relative strength rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3582258) measures price performance against all other stocks in IBD's database, whereas the RS line measures performance vs. the S&P 500.


With the stock market correction, investors should avoid making new buys and instead focus on [stocks for their watch lists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-correction/). Buying stocks heading into their quarterly earnings reports is also risky.



Insperity Earnings
------------------


The earnings report on Thursday could be a potential catalyst for the stock. Analysts expect Insperity earnings to grow 44% to 82 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is projected to rise 18% to $940 million, which would mark a third quarter of accelerating top-line growth.Â [Accelerating growth](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/how-to-trade-top-growth-stocks-big-moves-earnings-news/) is a hallmark trait of top growth stocks.


Insperity provides payroll administration, heath and workers' compensation insurance programs, and personnel records management. The company said on its Q2 earnings call that it's establishing an enterprise service model, investing in sales and service personnel and rolling out its new HR bundled solution, Workforce Acceleration.

**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), moving into buy zone Friday as the online sales giant continues to strengthen its grip on the China's e-commerce market.




Shares rose 3.2% to 204.34 in Friday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), clearing a 201.60 [double-bottom buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/). Volume was one-third above normal, which is OK but not great. You'd like to see a stock break out in volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal. Alibaba briefly topped the entry point on Wednesday, but pulled back. The 200 price level had been a stubborn resistance area.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a record high.

**CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it stages a breakout after reporting its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth.







Late Tuesday, the railroad giant reported that earnings jumped 58% to $1.01 a share, as revenue climbed 6% to $3.1 billion. The latest profit gain follows increases of 53%, 31% and 6%.


The results easily topped second-quarter estimates amid improving operating efficiency. The strong results are a good sign for the industry and economy.


CSX is the holding company for CSX Transportation, which was formed in 1980 by combining the railroads of the former Chessie System with Seaboard Coast Line Industries. It then added the Seaboard System Railroad in 1986. Today the Florida-based company operates approximately 21,000 route miles of track.


Shares leapt 7.1% to 69 in heavy volume on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), powering past a buy point of 67.79 from a five-week flat base. CSX's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is near an all-time high, though it has not risen dramatically in the last year.



CSX's move also marks a dramatic gap up from its 50-day line, a key technical support level, after dipping below it earlier this week.


The company is currently ranked in second place in the Transportation-Rail industry group. Group leader **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) is also currently hitting new highs. While CSX's [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) is a mediocre 74, its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is a top notch 90. In addition its [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is an impressive 81.

Stock Of The Day Seeks Efficiency
---------------------------------


CSX has been taking strides to transform and become more competitive. Its efforts are paying off, with the firm achieving a record operating ratio in it most recent quarter.


Seeking efficiency, it cut service in several low-volume lanes linking the Southeast and Northeast. The Dow Jones Transportation Average stock also axed some interline service with Union Pacific. It made another positive move when it laid off 1,000 management employees last year.


**Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)) reports after Wednesday's close. **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) and **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) also report this week.

DV Stock: Earnings, Revenue Growth
----------------------------------


New York City-based DoubleVerify provides digital media measurement and data analytics for internet TV and social media platforms. The company reduces ad fraud by verifying advertising views and engagement by consumers online.


It also promises to ensure placement of ads in safe and suitable environments for brands.


"With a full product suite of pre/post-bid solutions across social, connected TV, and retail media, DV helps clients better target/measure ad campaigns, while protecting brand safety," Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali said in a recent note to clients.


Founded in 2017, DoubleVerify competes with companies like **Comscore** ([SCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCOR)) and **Integral Ad Science** ([IAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAS)) in the measurement segment.


For full-year 2023, analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of 63 cents a share, up 152% from a year earlier. Revenue is expected to climb 23% to $557.5 million.


TikTok Is A New Customer
------------------------


DoubleVerify launched an initial public offering in April 2021 with shares priced at 27. After forming an IPO base, DV stock spiked to a record-high 48.42 in June 2021.


DoubleVerify has integrated its software across the digital advertising ecosystem, including programmatic platforms, social media channels and digital publishers.


Its two biggest social platforms are Facebook/Instagram, part of **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), and YouTube. Meanwhile, TikTok is a new customer.


**Netflix**'s ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) new ad-supported service also could provide upside, say analysts.


"We see numerous growth drivers for the business including connected TV," RBC Capital analyst Matthew Swanson said in a note. "The company now is the only verification company that covers all of the top ad-supported connected TV providers. Also, we see a near-term opportunity on volume as (ad-supported) services ramp."

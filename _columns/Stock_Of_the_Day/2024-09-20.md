S&P 500 giant **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the Facebook-parent declined slightly during market trade but is in a buy zone from an official entry amid Meta's nearly 60% rally this year.




The Facebook and Instagram parent company at the end of July [cleared Q2 estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-q2-earnings-instagram/) with a 73% increase in earnings on 22% revenue growth. Advertising revenue growth also outpaced forecasts.


Shares of Meta have galloped 18% higher since that earnings report as the company has pivoted from the metaverse to focus on its artificial intelligence ambitions.


Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg expects capital expenditures to range from $37 billion to $40 billion this year, with "significant capital expenditures growth" for 2025 as it builds out its advanced data center capacity. Long-term, Zuckerberg predicts Meta will offer fully-automated advertising plans to clients.

For the full year, analysts project that Meta's revenue will rise 19.7% to $161.5 billion in 2024, after climbing 15.7% last year, according to FactSet.


About 98% of Meta's revenue is from advertising placed on its "Family of Apps." The category includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, WhatsApp and Threads. The massive empire has more than 3 billion global users.


Meanwhile, Meta's earnings are expected to grow this year but at a slower rate compared to Meta's 2023 recovery year. Analysts project Meta EPS of $21.30 in 2024, up 43% from 2023, according to FactSet. In 2023, earnings increased 73% year over year.


Meta Stock Performance
----------------------


The Facebook-parent gained 0.4% to 561.35 during Friday's [market session](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), ending the week up 7%.


The S&P 500 giant is about 3% above an 542.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://marketsurge.investors.com/). The [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) for the pattern, which stretches 5% beyond the buy point, extends to 569.95.


Investors could also use an alternative entry of 544.23 from a [three-weeks tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), according to Meta stock chart analysis.



The stock struggled for much of July, falling to a three-month low of 442.65 on July 25. The slide came as the broader group of Magnificent Seven stocks struggled. The group — which includes **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) — shed [more than $1 trillion in market cap](https://www.investors.com/news/magnificent-seven-stocks-market-cap-loss/) over a five-day span last month.


Some investors [rotated out of outperforming Big Tech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-slumps-july-ads-ai/) and into other markets as confidence increased about a rate cut.


August was better, with a 10% gain for Meta. A strong earnings report helped reverse the trend. Meta stock jumped 4.8% on Aug. 1, following a [second-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-q2-earnings-instagram/) that beat expectations for sales and earnings.


The stock has rallied 58% so far this year.


Meta stock has a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. The S&P 500 component also has a 92 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) and a robust 96 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/).

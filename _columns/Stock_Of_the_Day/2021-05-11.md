**Callaway Golf** ([ELY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as earnings surge amid an outdoor trend spurred by the pandemic. ELY stock broke out.




The Carlsbad, Calif.-based company makes golf clubs and accessories sold worldwide. Its brands includeÂ Callaway Golf, Odyssey, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin.


Late Monday, the company reported earnings per share more than doubled to 62 cents, crushing forecasts for 12 cents, as sales jumped 47% to $652 million, beating estimates by 14%.


CEO Chip Brewer said sales were negatively impacted by lingering Covid restrictions in Europe, but offset by strong China sales.


"Our Q1 results exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations in all three of our principal business segments," he said in an earnings call with investors. "Our golf equipment segment continued to experience unprecedented demand which, combined with a strong performance by our supply chain team, delivered 29% revenue growth vs 2020, and 16% growth vs. 2019."


While total shutdowns early in the pandemic initially decimated golf-related sales, courses reopened in the second half of 2020. Not only did regulars return to golf courses, many newcomers also picked up the sport as it became one of only a few activities they could enjoy safely.


In fact, U.S. retail sales of golf equipment were up 72% compared to a year ago, and up 49% vs. Q1 2019, according to Golf Datatech.

Callaway Earnings Outlook
-------------------------


CEO Brewer says he expects the current unprecedented demand to moderate at some point, but he hasn't yet seen a slowdown.


"We continue to see particular strength in product aimed at women's, juniors and new entrants to the game," he said. "We are now quite confident that 2021 will be a very strong year and we also believe there will be a long-term benefit to the golf industry as we expect it will leave the pandemic period with a significantly larger total addressable market and strong momentum."


Callaway guided $3.2 billion in sales after its announcement on March 8 that it had completed its merger with Topgolf, a leading tech-enabled golf entertainment business.

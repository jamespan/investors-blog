**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the creator of the Snapchat app has grown to be highly popular with millennials and teenagers. Snap stock moved into buy range Thursday.




The social media company turned heads on July 23 with an [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-soars-on-second-quarter-earnings/) that blew past expectations as revenue doubled. Snap stock jumped 24% in reaction.


It has since moved into buy territory out of a consolidation, with an entry of 75.69, extending to 79.47. The stop loss is 71.87. Snap stock was up 0.5% at 77.24, during afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The company has a hearty [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 95 out of 99 and an equally strong [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97.

Snap IPO A Record Setter
------------------------


Snap burst onto the scene in 2017, with an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) that raised $3.4 billion and gave it a market valuation of $24 billion. That made [Snap the largest U.S.-listed IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) among tech companies since **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


But the party didn't last long as Snap stock tanked. It was a big target of Facebook, which had the Instagram platform. Facebook routinely copied the most popular features on Snapchat and applied them to Instagram.


Things are much better now. With continuous innovation, Snap stock turned a corner long ago. It's outpacing Instagram and trading at record highs. Perhaps a more serious competitor now is TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance.


The Snapchat app, which is free, initially hit the market in 2011. Users have access to a range of features designed to be creative, entertaining and amusing. Once a photo or video is taken via the Snachat app, users can manipulate and change the content in multiple ways for others to see.


Snap's latest innovation is in the cutting-edge field of augmented reality.


Augmented reality overlays digital images and other information into a person's field of view. Applications for the technology include navigation, education, games, commerce and more.


Snap Stock Gets Augmented Reality Boost
---------------------------------------


"Snap has continued to differentiate with unique content and innovative experiences for users," Snap stock analyst Scott Kessler of Third Bridge Group said in an email to Investor's Business Daily. "Our experts say Snap has done the best job in terms of social media AR/VR features and functionality, even though Facebook bought Oculus, a leader in this area, some seven years ago."


The good news for Snap is that not only is augmented reality entertaining, [it's also a revenue driver](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/snap-stock-climbs-as-it-engages-young-crowd/). Snap recently introduced an augmented reality feature it calls "TrueSize," which consumers can use as a shopping experience. Clothing company **FarFetch**, ([FTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTCH)) for example, uses Snap's AR technology in a way that consumers can virtually try on and shop a variety of jackets.


Watchmaker Piaget uses it so that consumers can try on a variety of timepieces. Privately held Zenni Optical uses True Size technology to help Snapchat users try on lens frames.


**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) has integrated Snapchat's technology as part of its "Play New" advertising campaign.


During the second quarter daily active users of Snapchat jumped 23%, or 55 million, to 293 million.


Snap Stock Third-Quarter Outlook: Double-Digit Growth
-----------------------------------------------------


For its third quarter, Snap expects revenue in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion. That's an increase of about 58% to 60% and above estimates of $1.01 billion. It expects daily average users to grow 21% to 301 million.


In mid-May, Snap introduced its first [augmented reality smart glasses](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/augmented-reality-snap-beats-apple-to-market-with-ar-smart-glasses/) called Spectacles. The company previously released camera-embedded sunglasses under the same name. But the new Spectacles aren't for consumers yet. The company is making them available to software developers to see what sorts of applications they can create with them.


Other features on Snapchat include a news feed and games.


"We are pleased by the progress our team is making with the development of our augmented reality platform, and we are energized by the many opportunities to grow our community and business around the world," said Chief Executive Evan Spiegel in his conference call with analysts following the [earnings report](https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2021/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx).

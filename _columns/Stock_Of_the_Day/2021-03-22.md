**Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of wireless chips sees strong demand amid the 5G upgrade cycle. Qorvo stock is approaching two possible buy points.




In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Qorvo stock climbed 1.9% to 183.28.

Qorvo Stock Riding Chip Cycle Rebound
-------------------------------------


Qorvo stock hit a more than 20-year high of 191.83 on Jan. 20. A cyclical rebound in the semiconductor sector has boosted Qorvo and other leading chip stocks. Qorvo earnings growth has accelerated in the past two quarters.


The Greensboro, N.C.-based company delivered a [beat-and-raise earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-diverge-quarterly-earnings-reports/) for its fiscal third quarter on Feb. 3. It cited surging demand for 5G wireless and Wi-Fi 6 chips.


"We expect robust end-market demand to continue into the March quarter, driving strong year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin expansion," Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy said in a news release. "For the full fiscal year, we now project free cash flow of approximately $1 billion."


Qorvo supplies chips for the iPhone and gets about 35% of its sales from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) business. However, lately it has been increasing its business with Android smartphone manufacturers.


Supply Chain Checks Positive For Wireless Chips
-----------------------------------------------


Eric Ross, chief investment strategist at research firm Cascend, said his firm's supply chain checks show strong demand for radio-frequency, or RF, chips. This bodes well for Qorvo and rival **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), he said in a recent note to clients.


"Our RF chip supply chain activity is now up more than 100% year over year for four consecutive months, or six of the past seven months," Ross said.


Qorvo stock is tied for first place with two other chipmakers in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-qorvo-inc-qrvo.aspx) tool. It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of 99, as do **Amkor Technology** ([AMKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMKR)) and **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)).


IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Qorvo Stock On IBD Stock Watchlist
----------------------------------


Qorvo stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 73 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 73% of stocks over the past 12 months.


Meanwhile, Qorvo's relative strength line is perking up following the recent tech stock swoon. The relative strength line compares a stock's performance to that of the S&P 500.


Qorvo stock is also on [IBD's Big Cap 20 stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


IBD's semiconductor manufacturing stock group ranks No. 52 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sotd-for-03-01-2019-desktop-1.png)Friday's jump lifted Live Nation stock's relative strength line to a new high.






**Live Nation Entertainment** ([LYV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYV)), the music-concert gatekeeper that merged with Ticketmaster nearly a decade ago, is the IBD Stock of the Day. Live Nation stock is breaking out of a consolidation but slightly extended a day after reporting fourth-quarter earnings.




Live Nation Stock
-----------------


Live Nation stock jumped 8% to 61.04 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). The stock's stretch higher pushed it past a 58.36 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But the advance put Live Nation stock 5% above the entry, making the stock [extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). Investors could move in, or wait for the stock to pull back, depending on their appetite for risk.


After working its way through a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) last summer and then a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), Live Nation stock consolidated through the end of last year. The stock has a weak Composite Rating of 57 out of a best-possible 99.


Still, Friday's jump lifted the stock's relative strength line to a new high. The relative strength line tracks how well a stock is doing against the S&P 500. The more the line points upward, the more a stock is outperforming the benchmark index.

Live Nation Earnings
--------------------


Live Nation runs scores of entertainment venues and puts on thousands of concerts a year across the globe. It also handles ticketing services.

Even as **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) make eating-in easy, and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) becomes a powerful gravitational force in the world's living rooms, people are still going to shows. Increasingly, they have to go through Live Nation to get there.


Live Nation on Thursday said that ticket sales for shows this year, as of mid-February, were "up double-digits." The company said it also saw double-digit attendance gains at its clubs, arenas, theaters and amphitheaters. Live Nation's market share widened last year.


For the fourth quarter, Live Nation booked around $2.6 billion in revenue, a 12% gain. Net loss attributable to shareholders was 9 cents. Earnings growth has been uneven in recent quarters.


'Experience Economy' Lifts Live Nation Stock
--------------------------------------------


Concerts revenue rose 11% last year. Average ticket prices for amphitheaters and arenas rose 13% over that time. Sponsorship at festivals is up. The company said it invested more than $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 nations last year. Some 500 million tickets went through Ticketmaster last year, Live Nation said.


The gains for Live Nation also come as the rise of online music distribution via apps like **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) and Pandora upends how artists make money at all. Touring and the merchandise table, in the process, have become more critical. The gains also come as more businesses try to cash in on people's efforts to cultivate a more Instagrammable life.


"Live is truly a unique entertainment form; it cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans are craving more than ever in this experience economy," the company said in its earnings release.


Some analysts have echoed that sentiment.


"On the supply side, artists are touring now more than ever as they have become increasingly reliant on touring as their primary source of income," William Blair analysts, in a research note Friday, said in their investment thesis on Live Nation stock.


"And on the demand side," they continued, "the combination of increased spending on experiences across all generations (especially millennials) and the introduction of social media has helped globalize the industry by connecting fans to artists on a much broader (and often instantaneous) level."

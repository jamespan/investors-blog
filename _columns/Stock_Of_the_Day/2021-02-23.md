**Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the fertility-benefits manager remains bullish on post-pandemic demand. PGNY stock is setting up a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) ahead of earnings, due Wednesday.




Progyny acts as a third-party insurance option specifically focused on pregnancy and family planning. The company gives customers access to a wide variety of fertility specialists and covers services like egg freezing, surrogacy, in vitro fertilization and adoption.


A recent Brookings Institution report found that 500,000 fewer babies could be born in the U.S. during 2021 as the Covid-19 pandemic closes hit employment rates and keep schools closed. But Progyny remains confident in demand.


"Looking at our broader market opportunities, we continue to believe that all the macro forces that have been driving our success remain intact. ... Our utilization shows that fertility patients and Progyny members in particular, remain focused on realizing the dreams of parenthood," COO Pete Anevski said during the Q3 earnings call.

Progyny Earnings To Jump
------------------------


Even as PGNY stock sets up a potential buying opportunity, investors should wait until after earnings to buy the stock unless buying through an option. A negative earnings report could swing the stock under the buy range and lead to a loss for investors. But using [option trades can minimize risks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/using-options-to-minimize-earnings-risk/).


The company reports after the market closes Wednesday, and analysts see EPS shooting up to 6 cents from a penny in the year-ago quarter, as revenue jumps 50% to $97.73 million.


The coronavirus pandemic upended health care as clinics were closed and hospitals focused resources on fighting the deadly virus. But many fertility clients have reopened with health and safety precautions in place.


Clients include tech giants **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google, and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). And that list is growing. In its Q3 report, Progyny said it expects to start 2021 with 180 total clients and 2.7 million members, up 36% and 29%, respectively, since Q1 2020.


The company is also seeing increased interest from same-sex couples, couples waiting to have children later in life and from single mothers.

The company's large trading desk also put up a jump in sales, lifted by strong client activity. Management said its commodities-focused segment performed strongly amid the "heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas and power."


Still, CEO David Solomon, during the earnings call with analysts who follow Goldman Sachs stock, cited "a number of emerging areas of uncertainty."


Among them, he said, were inflation, particularly in wages. He also said that coronavirus' delta variant, possible infrastructure deals and tax increases, along with the U.S.' relationship with China, hadÂ "the potential to be a headwind to growth."

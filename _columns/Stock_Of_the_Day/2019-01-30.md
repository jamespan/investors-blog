**Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), but for a different reason than virtually all the other stocks featured here in recent weeks. Why? The super performance since December for the top growth stock has triggered one of the most important sell signals for IBD-style traders.




That signal? Take partial or full profits when a stock rises 20% to 25% above a [critical buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). (Please read a July 18 [Investor's Corner column](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) for more detail on this [offense-type sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).)


Successful investing means knowing your sell rules as well as your rules for selecting and buying stocks. It means you are taking a holistic approach. After all, a profit on paper is simply on paper.


By bagging gains of 20% to 25% in numerous winners, you are not only doing a great job of offsetting the losing investments in the portfolio. You are also freeing up cash for other stocks that may do just as well or even better.


Kirkland Lake initially gave investors a [buy signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) when it cleared a [four-month cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) base on Dec. 10. That day, shares rose 1.8% and briefly stretched past a 23.96 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


In this winning chart pattern, find the [right buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) by adding a dime to the highest price on the cup's left side. So in Kirkland Lake's case, add 10 cents to 23.86 to get the buy point.


IBD Stock Of The Day: How Kirkland Lake Broke Out
-------------------------------------------------


On Dec. 10, volume jumped 41% above the stock's 50-day average. The very next day, Kirkland Lake rose another 2.2%. Volume bulged 52% above average. The stock was still in buy range, but this time it closed above the 23.96 buy point.


This chart action told savvy investors that the stock's character had changed. The [5% proper buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) extended up to 25.16.


So, what's rare about the Kirkland Lake breakout?


It came several weeks before the stock market showed a bottoming signal with a [Day 7 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) on Jan. 4 this year. Read more about how this is becoming more of a key inflection point in the stock market via this [Jan. 4 Big Picture story](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/).


Does Kirkland Lake Point To Sector Rotation On Wall Street?
-----------------------------------------------------------


Amid the depressing sell-offs seen across Wall Street from October to December, Kirkland Lake reflected a newfound shine among institutional investors toward precious metals companies.


On Tuesday, Kirkland Lake reached a new all-time high of 30.93. At that price, the stock's gain from the 23.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) has now reached 29%.


It's a good time to take profits.


Do you have strong conviction in the price of gold and the ability of Kirkland Lake's management to execute well? If so, then certainly you can decide to hold longer and see if that profit may expand to 30%, 40% or more.


However, don't let greed prevent you from drawing a line in the sand.


One of the most important defensive sell signals in a big stock market winner: Take profits when a stock [crashes through its 50-day or 10-week moving average in big volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


Every Great Stock Peaks At Some Point
-------------------------------------


After a long run-up, such action indicates that the big boys and big girls of the market (think mutual funds, large investment advisors, banks, pension funds and the like) are actively taking profits.


You don't want to get in front of that freight train of selling.



Right now, the 10-week moving average is near 25.68.


So if one were to sell at the moment Kirkland Lake trips below that 10-week line, a lot of profits will have been lost.


The Toronto-based miner went public in August 2017 and ended its first week of trading at 11.70. Without question, the company is proving solid execution. Earnings have grown from 8 cents a share in 2015 to 78 cents in 2017. Analysts see earnings jumping 60% to $1.25 a share in 2018 and another 18% to $1.47 in 2019.


Revenue, up 85% to $747 million in 2017, is expected to increase 20% to $900 million in 2018 and up 11% to $1 billion in 2019.


Since Kirkland's Dec. 10 breakout, gold futures on the Comex have ramped up 5.3%. On Wednesday, gold traded near $1,316 a troy ounce, hitting levels last seen in mid-May.

In addition, Raymond James on Oct. 20 announced its acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings for about $1.1 billion cash and stock.


In a press release, Raymond James CEO Paul Reilly said the acquisition illustrates the company's "commitment to utilize excess capital through organic and inorganic growth that we expect to drive strong returns for shareholders over the long term."


Raymond James will report fiscal first-quarter results later this month. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings per share to increase about 16% to $1.73, although forecasts call for a slowdown as the year progresses. Revenue projections put results at $2.62 billion, up 17.7%.


In a call with investors after reporting earnings, CEO Reilly highlighted impressive loan growth at Raymond James Bank, which increased 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion.


Consolidated brokerage revenue grew 9% year over year in Q4 to $541 million and 13% for the fiscal year to a record $2.2 billion.


Reilly has an optimistic but cautious outlook.


"If capital markets slow down or the economy turns and M&A deals stop and stuff, that's where we're going to get the margin compression again without interest rates," he said. "It looks good from the next quarter, but between the economy and Congress and regulators and interest rates, it all could change because those aren't in our control. "

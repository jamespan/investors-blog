**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the burrito retailer sets up in a bullish pattern. Sizzling digital sales and contactless deliveries have driven Chipotle stock near a new buy point, but the coronavirus pandemic poses a headwind to earnings in the near to short term.




As of March, Chipotle had more than 2,600 restaurants across the United States, Canada and Europe. It owns and operates those stores rather than using the typical franchise model. The Newport Beach, Calif.-based company has new partnerships with **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) Eats and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) to expand its digital and delivery footprint.


Chipotle stock has more than doubled from its March 20 coronavirus market low of 415. Shares plunged in February and March as the coronavirus revived memories of the E. coli outbreaks at Chipotle restaurants two to three years ago.


The IBD Retail-Restaurant group ranks a middling No. 78 out of 197 groups tracked. However, CMG stock is the No. 1 stock in this group, followed by **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)). Chipotle stock belongs to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/), a curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics. Domino's stock also is on Leaderboard, while Wingstop stock is on [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).

Chipotle Earnings And Fundamental Analysis
------------------------------------------


In April, Chipotle earnings easily beat views, though they fell 9% vs. a year earlier.


Notably, [Chipotle's digital sales jumped](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q1-2020-chipotle-stock-coronavirus/.) 80.8%, making up more than a quarter of overall Q1 sales. The trend was seen continuing in Q2 amid continued coronavirus restrictions, with many states limiting restaurants to takeout or delivery.


"Investing in digital over the last several years has allowed us to quickly pivot our business with Q1 digital sales reaching our highest ever quarterly level of $372 million," CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement.


But the still-raging pandemic has decimated the restaurant industry. Wall Street expects EPS to crumble 99% in Q2 and fall 37% for 2020 as a whole. They see 2021 EPS more than doubling to 18.24.


Chipotle earnings growth averaged 44% over the last three quarters, slightly below the three-year EPS growth rate of 50%. The Q1 earnings decline contributes to a mediocre EPS Rating of 61 out of 99. Sales growth averaged 14% over the past three quarters and 11% over the past three years.


Chipotle has a new pact with Shopify to help farmers in its supply chain sell directly to consumers online. Pursuing a return to growth, it's partnering with Grubhub and Uber Eats in Canada to expand its delivery platform.

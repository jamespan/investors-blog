During the gold rush, the best way to get rich was by selling the tools rather than doing the digging. Similarly, [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) offers investors the chance to get exposure to the fledgling industry without sinking their cash into the riskier marijuana stocks. Innovative Industrial Properties stock rallied past a new buy point Wednesday after a massive 352% run.




Innovative Industrial Properties is a profitable real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on the pot business. The San Diego-based firm partners with medical-use cannabis operators and serves as a source of capital by acquiring and leasing back their real estate assets. It has a portfolio of 21 properties comprising around 1.6 million square feet in 11 states.


While not as flashy as pot producers inking alliances and entering new markets, the IIPR strategy is paying off with earnings and sales growing like weed. Innovative Industrial Properties stock boasts a 97 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99 Composite. As for other marijuana stocks, **Cronos Group** ([CRON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRON)) has a decent 75 Composite Rating, **Canopy Growth** ([CGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGC)) a 55 CR and **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)), which has an abysmal 7.

In Wednesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), shares leapt 8.6% to 92.01, clearing a 91.37 buy point. The REIT stock has been consolidating for the past 11 weeks, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


After reclaiming its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) last Thursday, Innovative Industrial Properties stock rebounded from that key level Wednesday.


In addition, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, hit a new high Wednesday ahead of Innovative Industrial Properties stock. That's a bullish sign. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, has been trending upward since December 2017.



But the stock's long, strong rally carries a risk: Innovative Industrial Properties is in a fourth-stage base. Breakouts from such later-stage bases can be successful, but the odds are lower.


A Profitable Marijuana Stock
----------------------------


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-innovative-ind-prop-iipr.aspx) shows strong earnings and price performance. Innovative Industrial Properties' earnings per share have grown by an average of 93% over the past three quarters. EPS grew 135% in the latest quarter


Sales growth has been in the triple digits, like many marijuana stocks, from a very low base. Revenue grew 147% to $6.8 million in the latest quarter.


Analysts expect EPS to surge 108% in 2019 and 39% next year.


As a REIT, Innovative Industrial Properties returns most of its profits to investors. It has a $1.80 annual dividend, for a 2% yield at current prices.


Marijuana Stocks Struggle To Get Higher
---------------------------------------


Other marijuana stocks were mixed on the stock market Wednesday. Cronos stock jumped 11% as Bank of America hailed the company's plans for the U.S. market. But Canopy stock dipped 0.4%, Tilray stock shed 2.5% and **Aurora Cannabis** ([ACB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACB)) lost 1.8%.


Marijuana ETFs fell, with ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF ([MJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MJ)) off 0.1% and AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF ([YOLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YOLO)) down about 1%.


Marijuana stocks have received enormous hype, as legal recreational sales took hold in Canada and sales became legal in some form or another across more than half of the U.S.


But the marijuana industry is showing little in the way of profit growth as weed producers take on debt and burn through money to expand. Sales growth, while still large thanks to legalization, has occasionally disappointed analysts and so far failed to live up to lofty valuations.

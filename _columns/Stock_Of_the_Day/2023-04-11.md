DHI stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it offers an entry and homebuilder stocks at large rise near buy points due to an improving housing market.




**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) engages in the construction and sale of single-family housing. It claims to be the largest homebuilder by volume in the United States since 2002.


Earnings are expected to be tough for a few quarters for D.R. Horton and other homebuilders, but investors are looking beyond that.


As the housing market recovers, homebuilder stocks are acting well, with several near buy points, including **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN))and **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)).


In late March, the Fed signaled a shift toward pausing rate hikes.


In 2022, the housing market got hammered by higher mortgage rates, which jumped to a two-decade high above 7% from 3% at the start of the year. Mortgage rates have come down significantly.


DHI stock was added to the [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) Tuesday as it bounced from its 21- and 50-day moving averages, breaking a short-term downtrend.

The [Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows that DHI stock earns an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1) of 94, [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 and [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 91, all out of a best-possible 99.

Shares of the homebuilder gapped up 3.7% to 99.77 in heavy volume on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), after just retaking the 50-day moving average Monday.


The move above a downward-sloping trendline and short-term levels already offered buying opportunities earlier in the session.


On Tuesday, D.R. Horton stock also regained a still-valid 99.09 cup-with-handle [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/). It first seized that entry on March 23, then drifted lower to test the 50-day line, the [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) jumped Tuesday with the stock but has flattened out after a sharp rally in the second half of 2022. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.


D.R. Horton Earnings
--------------------


The Arlington, Texas-based company boasts a strong record of earnings growth. The homebuilder has seen its earnings vault from $2.74 a share in 2017 to $16.51 in 2022, growing at a robust pace despite the Covid-19 pandemic.


On a per-share basis, D.R. Horton earnings rose nearly 45% in fiscal 2022, following a 78% leap the prior year.


But earnings growth has slowed and turned into a decline in the latest quarter, ended in December.


The Street sees D.R. Horton earnings plunging 45% in 2023 as sales fall 15%.


Analysts call for a 4% rebound in 2024 but earnings per share would still be well below 2022 levels.


Industry peers include **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), Meritage Homes, **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), Lennar, PulteÂ and **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)).


Many of those homebuilder stocks are also nearing buy points.

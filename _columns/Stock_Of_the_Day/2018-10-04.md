**Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the energy exploration firm remains near a buy zone with oil prices holding at multiyear highs.




The company explores, produces oil and natural gas in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. Top stock Oasis Petroleum is among the many energy stock benefiting from spiking crude oil prices amid a strong U.S. economy and tight global supply, though OPEC recently signaled it was raising output. However oil stocks are closely tied to crude prices. If oil prices fall, energy stocks will follow suit.


U.S. crude futures fell 2.7% to $74.33 a barrel Thursday, after hitting four-year highs earlier in the week. Brent crude lost 2% to $84.58.


Shares in the shale exploration and production play retreated 2.7% to 13.83 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Oasis stock just undercut a buy point of 14 cleared last week. But the Oasis stock chart still looks OK compared to the damage in many leading growth plays Thursday.



Top stock Oasis was holding well clear of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), which is a bullish sign. However its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been choppy, and the stock price has been whipsawing in recent weeks.


Other oil stocks around buy range include **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) and Dow Jones energy giant **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)). Continental Resources stock and Diamondback Energy stock, both shale plays, were testing or undercutting recent buy points. Refinery play Marathon Petroleum stock, as well as oil major Exxon Mobil stock, fell slightly Thursday but are still in buy range.

Oasis Stock Fundamentals Strong
-------------------------------


Oasis is not one of the foremost names in the extremely competitive [Oil & Gas — U.S. Exploration & Production industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-03-2018/). Nevertheless, the top stock boasts extremely strong fundamentals, which are reflected in its impressive [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 95.


Earnings have returned with oil prices, with revenue nearly doubling in the latest quarter.

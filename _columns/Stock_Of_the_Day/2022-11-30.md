Insulin-pump maker **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) as PODD stock hovers in a buy zone.




Insulet shares broke out in early November and quickly surged above the 5% chase zone after the company crushed September-quarter expectations. The company also raised its guidance for full-year revenue, with burgeoning growth for its Omnipod insulin delivery system in the U.S.


Shares have a rich valuation, Bank of America Securities analyst Travis Steed said in a recent report to clients.


"This is in line with high-growth diabetes companies, which we think is reasonable given Insulet's high-growth recurring revenue business model and competitive positioning with a recent new product approval," he said.


Amid a broad rally on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), PODD stock jumped 3.8% to close at 299.37.


PODD Stock: Rivaling Other Insulin Pump Makers
----------------------------------------------


Founded in 2000, Insulet makes Omnipod, a body-worn insulin pump. These pumps — which include devices from rivals **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) and **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) — can be paired with body-worn continuous glucose monitors.


Insulin pumps respond when blood sugar levels fall out of a patient's desired range. When insulin falls too low, patients can experience a variety of symptoms, like blurred vision and drowsiness. High insulin levels can lead to weight gain, hunger and fatigue.


Insulet's Omnipod 5 is now cleared in the U.S. and Europe for children as young as age 2 with type 1 diabetes — a boon for PODD stock. This is a genetic condition in which the body doesn't make enough, or any, of its own insulin. Insulet, and others in the diabetes devices space, are also focusing on the type 2 diabetes space. This is a progressive condition in which patients eventually need supplemental insulin.


Test results in young children have been promising so far, says BTIG analyst Marie Thibault. After three months, 90% of children who wore Omnipod had "very good" or "fairly good" sleep, up from 65% at the beginning of the study. Further, there were no severe side effects, she said.


"We think the totality of this evidence demonstrates that Omnipod 5 is both a valuable and reliable solution for people with type 1 diabetes across all ages and their caregivers," she said in her note to clients. She has a buy rating and 285 price target on PODD stock.


Potential For Upside In Type 2 Market
-------------------------------------


In the current quarter, analysts expect $332 million in sales for Insulet. Sales would rise roughly 8%. Though adjusted earnings of 17 cents per share would decline about 60% from the year-earlier period.


Bank of America's Steed notes Insulet could enjoy greater sales if penetration into the type 2 market goes smoothly. He noted the Omnipod is also now available through pharmacies, easing the path for patients to access the device. He has a price target of 300 on PODD stock.


Insulet shares are now trading in the 5% chase zone above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 283.38 out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/), according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) runs from 238.38 to 250.30. Investors could also look for PODD stock to move the Nov. 25 high of 295.95 for another entry.


Bullishly, PODD stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of a best-possible 99. This puts shares in the leading 9% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital).

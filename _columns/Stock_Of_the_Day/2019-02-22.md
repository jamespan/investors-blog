**Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as it has won accolades as a pioneer in the field of big data and analytics designed to help businesses make smarter decisions.




Splunk stock was trading near 134.56, up 1.6% on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares currently trade about 3.4% above a 130.10 buy point from a first-stage [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/).


One cautionary note: As the stock [rose above that buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/splunk-trading-in-buy-range-with-earnings-on-deck/), it did so on relatively low volume. That suggests light participation among institutional investors in general.


Still, the company has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99. That means it's outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.

Splunk also holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Database industry group. **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) and **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) also are among the group's highest-rated stocks.


Its relative strength line also is near a record high. Splunk has an excellent [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 96 out of 99, which reflects [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) performance. The related [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) compares a stock's price action to that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the growth stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line says the stock is being passed up.


Help In Analyzing Data
----------------------


Splunk provides intelligence software designed to help organizations search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on data in real time. The software is geared to analyze vast amounts of historical information.


Splunk held its initial public offering in April 2012. Shares priced at 17 and more than doubled on the first day of trading. Splunk stock now trades near 133.


Last year was a turning point for Splunk stock, which struggled for four years to climb its way back to the peak it hit in February 2014. It broke through that resistance last March.


Splunk Stock: Earnings Due Thursday
-----------------------------------


While the stock is currently in a buy zone, it should be watched closely as it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Stocks can make sharp moves, up or down, when earnings are reported, depending on unexpected news.


The company consistently has reported double-digit revenue growth going back more than four years. Revenue estimates by Wall Street analysts expect that growth rate to continue over the next four quarters. Estimates on adjusted earnings per share over the same time period are also positive.


When Splunk reports fiscal fourth-quarter results for the period ended Jan. 21, analysts are looking for earnings growth of 105% to 76 cents per share, on revenue of $562.5 million, up 35%. The company smashed estimates when it reported [fiscal third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/splunk-earnings-q3/), as it raised revenue guidance.

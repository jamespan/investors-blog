**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of computer-aided design software is holding strong ahead of its second-quarter earnings report. Autodesk stock is approaching a buy point.




The San Rafael, Calif.-based company will post fiscal second-quarter results sometime in late August. But Autodesk stock has been volatile around earnings news. After its first-quarter report on May 23, it tumbled 4.9%. And after its fourth-quarter 2018 report on Feb. 28, it sank 2%.


Autodesk stock has formed a first-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 179.05. However, aggressive investors see an earlier entry of 175.38 from a short decline within the larger [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-successful-investing/). On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Autodesk stock fell 1.8% to close at 169.31.


Autodesk stock has been a stair-stepper with modest gains followed by pullbacks. But its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has generally trended higher over time. The line has been mainly horizontal since the stock started forming its current base.

Accelerating Earnings Growth For Five Straight Quarters
-------------------------------------------------------


The company has won fans on Wall Street for its successful transition from licensed software to software-as-a-service (SaaS). The shift to a cloud computing model has led to accelerating earnings growth over the past five quarters. On an absolute-value basis, per-share earnings have increased year over year the last five quarters by 138%, 273%, 342%, 611% and 650%.


Autodesk's next big business move is expanding services to the construction industry. It is seeking to provide a complete workflow system ranging from architects through building contractors. The construction industry has been slow to digitize its workflow processes.


While Autodesk stock is up about 34% year to date, it has lagged other names in the enterprise software space. The reasons are manifold, analysts say. The company has had a choppy run of quarterly reports where it has disappointed Wall Street on metrics such as free cash flow, subscribers and annualized recurring revenue. Investors also worry about Autodesk's historic sensitivity to macroeconomic downturns.


Autodesk stock ranks No. 4 out of 11 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Design industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-autodesk-inc-adsk.aspx). **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) is the top-ranked stock in the group, followed by **Ansys** ([ANSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANSS)) and **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)).


Focus On Free Cash Flow For Autodesk Stock
------------------------------------------


For Autodesk shares to appreciate, the company will need to meet its targets for free cash flow, Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda told Investor's Business Daily. Autodesk has forecast a rapid ramp in free cash flow over the next three quarters, he said. It is supposed to hit $1.35 billion this year, and rise to $2.4 billion in 2023.


"We feel that free-cash-flow target is very achievable," Ikeda said. "They carry a near monopoly in the industries that they work with. They are must-use technology and they're able to control price."


Ikeda rates Autodesk stock as outperform with a price target of 190.


Construction Industry Software Next Big Opportunity
---------------------------------------------------


Autodesk's transition to subscription software is pretty much played out, Guggenheim Securities analyst Ken Wong told IBD. He is neutral on the stock.


Autodesk will need to prove its potential in the construction industry vertical for him to turn positive on the stock, Wong said.


"With construction, it's still early days," he said. "It's clearly a big new opportunity for these guys."


He believes Autodesk stock has underperformed other enterprise software names because its transition from licensed software to subscriptions hasn't gone as smoothly as it has for **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and others.


"There's a bit of a curse from everyone comparing Autodesk and (design software peer) **PTC** ([PTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTC)) to Adobe, which is the trailblazer of revenue transitions and obviously executed on it extremely well," Wong said.


Oppenheimer's Ikeda believes the construction industry will be a "great growth driver" for Autodesk for the next three to five years. After mastering the construction industry, Autodesk hopes to offer a similar suite of workflow software for the manufacturing industry, he said.

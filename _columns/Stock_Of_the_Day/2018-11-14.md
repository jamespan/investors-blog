**Kornit Digital** ([KRNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRNT)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day as the maker of digital printing technologies for the garment, apparel and textile industries continues its streak of triple-digit earnings growth.




Kornit Digital stock broke out of a 10-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) on Wednesday at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of 22.30.

Earlier in the session it climbed as high as 23.61, a record high for the stock, which went public in 2015 at $10 a share.


The Israel-based company on Monday reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. Kornit Digital earned an adjusted 13 cents a share, beating analyst estimates by a penny.

"Our sales are accelerating as our customers respond to dynamic challenges to reduce printed apparel run length and lead times while minimizing inventory risk," Chief Executive Ronen Samuel said [in a news release](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/12/1649995/0/en/Kornit-Digital-Reports-2018-Third-Quarter-Results.html). "Kornit is uniquely positioned to address these evolving priorities with the right technology that delivers superior print quality and hand-feel to end consumers."


Amazon Is A Major Kornit Digital Customer
-----------------------------------------


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) accounted for 20% of Kornit's revenue last quarter. Amazon uses Kornit textile printers for a [print-on-demand apparel service](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/11/905049/0/en/Kornit-Digital-Signs-Agreement-with-Amazon.html) that makes graphic T-shirts.


Needham analyst James Ricchiuti on Tuesday reiterated his buy rating on Kornit Digital stock with a price target of 24.


"Kornit continues to see strong demand for the new Avalanche HD printers, while beta testing of a new mass production system got underway in the quarter, with commercial availability expected in mid-2019," he said in a note to clients.


Kornit's guidance for the fourth quarter was in line with expectations, he said. It expects revenue to rise 24% to 30% year over year, vs. Wall Street's target of 27%.


"We remain optimistic about Kornit's growth prospects looking out to 2019, with continued strong new product momentum," Ricchiuti said.


Kornit Digital is a small company and its stock is thinly traded. That makes it riskier for investors than larger companies.

**Evertec** ([EVTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVTC)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). As other payment stocks like **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) roll over in the bear market storm, Evertec stock has stayed above the fray. The Latin American payments processor is trading tightly through a bullish pattern, with Evertech earnings growth accelerating.




Evertec Stock Technical Analysis
--------------------------------


With the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) continuing to sell off and the S&P 500 index entering a bear market — as President Donald Trump continued to attack the Fed and as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's [efforts to calm markets backfired](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-mnuchin-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs/) — Evertec is trading like it's 2017. Evertec stock is in a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) with a 29.80 buy point. Despite a plunging, volatile stock market, Evertec stock has been trading tightly for four weeks.


One way to gauge potential leaders when the rebound comes is a stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). That line compares a stock's performance against the S&P 500. Evertec's RS line is at highs not reached since 2014.


Evertec stock fell 2.1% to 26.64 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), closing just above its 50-day line. Its value nearly doubled this year.


But that doesn't mean it's a good time to buy stocks. IBD doesn't recommend buying in a stock market correction, especially with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index in bear market territory. Rather, it's better to nurture your stock lists. And watch for stocks of companies that emerge as leaders when markets rebound.


Evertec Earnings Growth Accelerates
-----------------------------------


Evertec has a 95 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating combines several IBD proprietary ratings, including for earnings, into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their runs.


Evertec earnings growth has been accelerating for the past three quarters, reporting a 36% EPS gain on Oct. 30. That spurred an Evertec stock run-up to record highs in early November. Analysts expect Evertec earnings growth to pick up to 83% in the current quarter. Part of that is due to easy year-earlier comparisons, when [Hurricane Maria](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/hurricane-maria-causes-trauma-fuels-purpose-among-us-puerto-ricans-n949371) devastated the Caribbean.


Hurricane Recovery
------------------


Evertec stock has rebounded this year as Puerto Rico and the broader Caribbean recovers from Hurricane Maria. But William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said in a research note last week that the company's rebound from the storm was faster and better than Wall Street had expected.


Evertec, he added, has always been conservative with its guidance, given the volatility in Puerto Rico's economy.


"However, we believe the Puerto Rican economy will likely benefit from reconstruction and investment as well as disaster relief funding over the next several years," he said. "We believe the company is also well positioned to benefit from the growth of payments in Latin America broadly, over time, as markets open to non-bank competitors."


Other Payment Stocks
--------------------


Among other payment stocks, **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) fell 0.9%. PayPal stock was down 1.4%. **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) fell 3.4%. Visa stock lost 2% and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) dipped 0.3%. All of these payment stocks are well below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

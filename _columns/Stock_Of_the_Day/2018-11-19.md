**T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as investors gain confidence that its proposed Sprint merger will get a green light. T-Mobile stock has been holding up amid a market correction.




Shares in the wireless services provider took a big hit in late April when it announced a merger with debt-laden **Sprint** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)). Investors worried that regulators could shoot down the proposed deal.


T-Mobile stock has rebounded on views that the Trump administration will approve the Sprint merger.


Even if the deal doesn't happen, T-Mobile continues to have plenty of operating momentum, analysts say. The company again led the industry in the September quarter in revenue growth and postpaid subscriber additions.

T-Mobile Stock Near Buy Point
-----------------------------


T-Mobile stock is trading about 4% below a technical buy point of 71.04. Shares in T-Mobile, owned by Germany's **Deutsche Telekom** ([DTEGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DTEGY)), slipped 1.7% to 68 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?) amid a broad sell-off in technology stocks.


The wireless phone company has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97 out of a possible 99. That means its shares outperform 97% of all stocks in the market as measured by key fundamental and technical metrics. Some of those metrics include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance.


Its relative strength rating now stands at 89. That's not in the top echelon but has been improving steadily since August.


Further, the company is expected to report double-digit profit gains in coming quarters, throughout all of 2018 and into 2019. Its earnings growth over the last five years amounts to more than 100%. And rival **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) also is on a tear, up more than 16% since hitting a buy point in late July, with most of those gains coming since late October.


Sprint Merger: Regulators Eye Market Consolidation
--------------------------------------------------


One reason federal regulators could shoot down the T-Mobile and Sprint merger is that the deal would reduce the number of national wireless firms to three from four. Verizon and **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) are the two biggest wireless firms.


Blair Levin, analyst at New Street Research, said in a report published Sunday that the merger could be approved in the second quarter of 2019. Levin says recent comments by Makan Delrahim, antitrust chief of the U.S. Justice Department, support that view.


"His words suggest he remains open to a reduction in the number of national competitors," Levin said in the report.


Still, some T-Mobile stock analysts rate approval a tossup. Regulators in 2011 blocked AT&T's purchase of T-Mobile.


T-Mobile and Sprint, owned by Japan-based SoftBank, say the merger will help them compete vs. AT&T and Verizon.


Sprint and T-Mobile also need to convince regulators and lawmakers that consumer prices will not rise if they merge


T-Mobile Plans 5G Wireless
--------------------------


T-Mobile and Sprint argue that they'll increase competition by selling 5G residential broadband services.


Their 5G wireless broadband service would compete with phone companies' broadband in rural areas. It would also compete with cable TV companies in urban and suburban settings.


Deutsche Telekom plans to own a 42% stake in a combined Sprint-T-Mobile, with SoftBank taking a 27% share. Public shareholders get the rest of the company.


Even if the merger is rejected, T-Mobile would be well-positioned, analysts say.


"We continue to favor T-Mobile either on the potential merger or as a stand-alone," Cowen analyst Colby Synesael said in a note to clients. "If a deal does not occur, T-Mobile shares remain attractive considering the free-cash-flow growth and what would likely be a reinstated and likely upsized buyback."


T-Mobile Leads In Subscriber Growth
-----------------------------------


T-Mobile has upgraded its wireless network, closing the performance gap with Verizon, whose advertising for years has touted its top-rated network.


T-Mobile's "Uncarrier"-branded marketing campaign and price discounts has enabled it to take market share from AT&T and Verizon for over three years.


In the September quarter, T-Mobile added 774,000 high-spending postpaid phone customers. That topped analyst estimates of 617,000 additions. AT&T added 69,000 postpaid phone customers in the September quarter. Verizon added 295,000.


T-Mobile said that adjusted earnings were 93 cents a share, up 47% from a year ago. Revenue rose 8% to $10.8 billion, topping analyst forecasts.


However, T-Mobile added fewer lower-spending "prepaid" customers than expected in the third quarter. AT&T has stepped up marketing that targets prepaid customers.


One worry is that, if the economy slows, T-Mobile's prepaid subscriber growth could slow further.

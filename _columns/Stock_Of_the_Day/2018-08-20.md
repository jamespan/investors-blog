**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the sportswear giant swooshes back into buy zone on a pair of analyst upgrades. Nike stock is benefiting from accelerating growth as the Dow Jones component continues a turnaround.




Piper Jaffray upgraded Nike stock to overweight from neutral with a 93 price target. Senior analyst Erinn Murphy sees continued sales momentum in North America as a catalyst to continuing growth in its athletic category. Online retail is also expected to generate significant revenue.


Meanwhile Susquehanna Financial Group raised the Dow Jones stock to positive from neutral, also with a 93 price target. Analyst Sam Poser said Nike is snatching share from main rival **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)), and that it is managing to balance scale and scarcity.


Shares closed up 3% at 82.18 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?), hitting a new high and reclaiming an 81.10 buy point from a flat base, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). [Nike stock moved above the entry](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/nike-stock-hits-buy-point-adidas-earnings-strong/) on Aug. 9, as Adidas soared on earnings. But that initial Nike breakout came in below-average volume and shares quickly pulled back below the buy point. On Monday, Nike stock volume looks strong so far.



Nike's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging the stock price slightly. Ideally, an RS line will move to a new high ahead of or with the stock price. 


Adidas stock rose 1.2%, and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) jumped 5%, hitting a new high.

Nike Earnings, Sales Growth Accelerate
--------------------------------------


Nike stock has enjoyed three consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth, with North America sales rebounding. After three tough quarters, Nike earnings have turned positive.


The Dow Jones stock has advanced 31% so far in 2018. The increasing strength in Nike stock is reflected in its improving [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-). It now sits at an impressive, but not ideal, 92.


Stock Of The Day Nike Impresses Analysts
----------------------------------------


According to Piper Jaffray's Murphy, the healthy state of the athletics category means Nike's guided top-line compound annual growth rate could be conservative.


"We believe the risk profile of owning NKE shares has considerably diminished as negative EPS revisions are likely over," she said in a research note. "More importantly, we see the leaner-inventory backdrop, innovation-led product pipeline, (direct-to-consumer) shift & China expansion opportunities as firm drivers of an upward EPS cycle."



Murphy also said the consumer shift to online retail is a significant tailwind. This is due to a low risk from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) encroachment and an accelerating increase in revenue per unit.


Meanwhile Susquehanna's Poser said the Dow Jones stock's improved performance is helping it to dominate rivals.


"Based on our proprietary checks with retailers, and with some of Nike's competitors, it has become clear, after some concern on our end, that Nike is beginning to balance scale and scarcity well, across the spectrum of retail partners and across merchandise categories," he said in a research note. "Also, better retailers, large and small, recognize that Nike's new, innovative product is taking share from Adidas, which is rapidly decelerating."


New Moves Boost Nike Stock
--------------------------


The athletics apparel behemoth has cited the launch of its app at retail in flagship stores in certain major North American cities and a digital push abroad have helped drive growth in Nike.com revenue. The company has also ramped up its speed of delivery in certain cities.


In China, Nike is the clear front-runner. It holds an 8.1% share of the one-party state's mammoth $56.6 billion footwear industry, according to Euromonitor. Second-place Adidas holds a 4.7% share. In a country with almost 1.4 billion pairs of feet, the revenue potential is enormous.


Nike products sold in China are made in China, Vietnam and Indonesia. This bypasses the risk from [tariffs on U.S. goods imported into China](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-targets-boeing-gm-ford-trump-tariffs/).


On Friday, **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) will report quarterly earnings, offering some insight into Nike shoe demand in the U.S. Foot Locker stock rose 2% Monday, finishing just below its 50-day line.

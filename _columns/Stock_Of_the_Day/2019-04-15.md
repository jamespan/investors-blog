**Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) is the IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm approaches an entry point amid rising analyst earnings estimates.




Mimecast stock popped on better-than-expected earnings and guidance in February. Shares in the U.K.-based cybersecurity provider consolidated over the next 10 weeks. Shares then climbed above their 50-day moving average in bullish fashion.


Mimecast is trading about 4% below a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 51.77. The company sells cloud-based email security services. It also provides services known as targeted threat protection, or TPP, that guard companies against malware hidden in file attachments.


Many of its customers use **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Office 365, an online version of Microsoft's Office productivity software.

Mimecast Competes With Proofpoint, Cisco
----------------------------------------


Mimecast Chief Executive Peter Bauer co-founded the company in 2003. He has served as CEO since then.


**Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) is a chief rival of Mimecast. Meanwhile, Proofpoint stock has formed a [cup-with-handle chart pattern near a buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-basics-analyze-both-daily-weekly-stock-charts/)


Mimecast belongs to the highly rated Computer-Software Security group, which ranks [No. 7 out of IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-12-2019/). Peer **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Mimecast for many years focused on companies with less than 1,000 employees. It has stepped up marketing to bigger companies. In the December quarter, Mimecast recorded its largest deal ever with a financial services customer with 55,000 employees. Large customers of 5,000 employees or more now make up 17% of revenue.


Mimecast Stock: Profit Expected To Nearly Double
------------------------------------------------


Mimecast's fiscal third-quarter earnings, reported on Feb. 11, blew past estimates.


"Market share gains with larger customers, new products, and secular trends helped drive Mimecast's clean beat and raise for fiscal 2019," Barclays analyst Saket Kalia said in a note to clients.


Mimecast reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on May 13.


Analysts expect Mimecast to swing to a profit of 8 cents per share, up from a 5-cent loss in the year-earlier period. Mimecast revenue is projected to jump nearly 25% to $91.4 million.


In fiscal 2020, analysts expect earnings to nearly double to 50 cents a share. Revenue will grow 24% to $420 million, slowing a bit from nearly 30% the previous year, analysts project.


Microsoft Security Tools Also Compete
-------------------------------------


Mimecast also competes with **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)).


Microsoft and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Google also provide email security tools along with their business software, noted Terry Tillman, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst.


Microsoft bundles security tools with Office 365. But Mimecast's email cybersecurity software is more feature-rich, analysts say.


"The biggest threat competitively (to Mimecast) that is likely to persist for investors going forward lies with Microsoft and Google offering security offerings as part of their core mailbox offerings," said Tillman in a report.


Mimecast in January acquired Simply Migrate, a provider of data archive migration technology.


Mimecast stock climbed 0.7% to close at 50.07 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

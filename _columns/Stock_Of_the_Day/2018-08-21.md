On Aug. 7, the FDA said Vertex could use [Orkambi in children](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-orkambir-lumacaftorivacaftor-first-medicine-treat) age two to five who have the most common genetic mutation tied to cystic fibrosis. The drug is available in two dosage strengths based on patient weight.


"We believe it is important to treat the underlying cause of the disease as early as possible and this approval is another significant milestone in our journey to bring effective medicines to all people living with cystic fibrosis," Chief Medical Officer Reshma Kewalramani said in a written statement.


Youngest Population
-------------------


Later in August, the FDA approved the [use of Kalydeco](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-kalydecor-ivacaftor-first-and-only-medicine-treat) in children age 12 months to less than 24 months with a specific genetic mutation. Earlier treatment is key to slowing the progression of cystic fibrosis, which can be life-threatening. The median age of death in these patients is mid- to late 20s.


Kalydeco is what's known as a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiator, or a CFTR modulator. Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff noted this is the youngest patient group any CFTR modulator has been approved to treat.


This underscores "the strong safety profile of Kalydeco," he said in a recent report. "Intervention as young as one year of age is also meaningful to improve long-term outcome."


Australian Reimbursement
------------------------


Meanwhile, Vertex is making headway in securing insurance reimbursement for its cystic fibrosis treatments. On Monday, Vertex said Australian officials recommended [reimbursement for Orkambi](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-receives-positive-pbac-recommendation-reimbursement) in patients age six and older with a specific genetic mutation.


The recommendation puts about 1,300 patients in Australia closer to getting access to Orkambi, the biotech said in a news release.


In a recent report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams noted that securing reimbursement for [cystic fibrosis treatments](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/galapagos-cystic-fibrosis-treatment-disappoints/) outside the U.S. has been a hurdle. Previously, Australian officials rejected Orkambi reimbursement due to "unacceptable" cost effectiveness and uncertain long-term impact.


Officials had been seeking a price of $24,000 per year for Orkambi, he said in a report. This would be at an 80%-90% discount.


"While the unknown timeline for launch makes it unclear to what specific degree we could see upside in the second half of 2018 numbers/guidance, we view this as a meaningful step and could potentially see a positive influence on the other countries which are still pushing back," he said.

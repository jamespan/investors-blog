**HMS Holdings** ([HMSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMSY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the health care cost containment specialist holds in a buy range with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) at new highs. HMS stock broke out on strong earnings, but profit growth is a concern going forward.




On Aug. 2, HMS reported second-quarter earnings of 34 cents per share up 36% vs. a year earlier. That beat analyst estimates for HMS earnings of 26 cents. Revenue rose nearly 15% to $168.2 million, also beating.


The company has been investing in [artificial intelligence.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) During the Q2 call HMS announced a new VP of data engineering and analytics to drive artificial intelligence investments across the company's business units.


HMS Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------


HMS stock blasted past a pair of potential buy points following the Q2 earnings report. Shares moved above a 35.36 entry from [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Shares also moved above the top of the consolidation, providing an alternate entry at 38.25.


One could view that long consolidation as a quasi-handle on a long pattern going back to 2012. That shows why looking at different time frames, in this case a monthly chart, is important when studying a stock's technical action.


HMS stock is extended from the 35.36 buy point, but holding just above the 38.25 entry.


Shares climbed 2.9% to 39.38 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/).


The relative strength line has been hitting new highs, reflecting HMS stock's stout performance amid broad market volatility. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


The RS line is an easy way to separate leading stocks from laggards in good markets or bad. Investors should look for stocks with rising RS lines, hitting new highs with or ahead of stocks.



HMS has a 99 Composite Rating and a 98 EPS Rating, according to [IBD's Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-h-m-s-holdings-corp-hmsy.aspx). It's the highest-ranked stock in IBD's Commercial Services-Healthcare Group. The group also includes **National Research** ([NRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NRC)), **Corvel** ([CRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRVL)) and **HealthStream** ([HSTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSTM)).


HMS Earnings Growth Seen Slowing
--------------------------------


HMS's business breaks down into three segments. Its oldest and largest business segment is its coordination of benefits unit. The division accounts for two-thirds of its revenue and makes sure the right insurance plan is paying for a medical claim if a patient is covered under multiple insurance providers, such as Medicaid.


In its Q2 report, HSM raised its full-year sales outlook to $650 million to $660 million, up from $640 million to $650 million.


Over the last three years, HMS earnings have risen an average of 34%, a strong pace. On the revenue side, HMS's three-year growth rate is 10%.


Investors generally should look for stocks with sustained earnings and sales growth of at least 25%.


But earnings growth is expected to trend lower. Analysts see HMS earnings per share rising 5% to $1.32 and 2020 EPS up just 2% to $1.35, so investors should be alert.


However, HMS earnings have beaten views by at least six cents in each of the last six quarters, suggesting the cost-containment specialist will continue to squeeze out decent profit growth.

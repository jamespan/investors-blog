**Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday as shares of the jet engine and defense components supplier close in on a buy point. Investment guru Warren Buffett earlier this summer opened up a new position in Heico and loaded up on shares.  
**Heico** （[HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)） 是周二的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为这家喷气发动机和国防部件供应商的股价接近买入点。今年夏天早些时候，投资大师沃伦·巴菲特 （Warren Buffett） 在 Heico 开设了新头寸并增持了股票。




Hollywood, Fla.-based Heico produces parts, electronics and control and test systems for customers in the defense and aerospace industries. The company's products are found on a variety of industrial turbines, targeting systems, missiles and electro-optical devices.  
总部位于佛罗里达州好莱坞的 Heico 为国防和航空航天行业的客户生产零件、电子元件以及控制和测试系统。该公司的产品可用于各种工业涡轮机、瞄准系统、导弹和光电设备。


Heico's earnings growth rebounded over the last three quarters, to a 31% gain for its Q3 report in August, after slowing to a 6% increase in Q4 of last year. The defense contractor averaged 43.5% revenue growth over that period, driven by strong demand for aftermarket parts within its Flight Support Group division. However, sales growth decelerated modestly to a 37% gain for its most recent report.  
Heico 的盈利增长在过去三个季度反弹，在去年第四季度放缓至 6% 之后，8 月份的第三季度报告增长了 31%。在此期间，这家国防承包商的平均收入增长了 43.5%，这得益于其 Flight Support Group 部门对售后零件的强劲需求。然而，在其最近的报告中，销售额增长小幅放缓至 37%。


Still, Heico's roughly 36% gain in 2024 through the beginning of August was enough to pique the interest of investment oracle Buffett.  
尽管如此，截至 8 月初，Heico 在 2024 年约 36% 的涨幅足以激起投资预言家巴菲特的兴趣。


**Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), [Warren Buffett's investment firm, bought shares of Heico](https://www.investors.com/news/warren-buffett-q2-2024-stock-buys-sells-berkshire-hathaway-13f/) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) during the second quarter, according to the fund's regulatory filings tracked by [whalewisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc).  
根据 [whalewisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc) 跟踪的该基金的监管文件，[沃伦·巴菲特的投资公司](https://www.investors.com/news/warren-buffett-q2-2024-stock-buys-sells-berkshire-hathaway-13f/)**伯克希尔·哈撒韦**公司 （[BRKB）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB) 在第二季度购买了 Heico 和 **Ulta Beauty** （[ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)） 的股票。


Berkshire purchased 1.044 million shares of HEI in Q2 at around 165 per share, with a market value of over $185.37 million, whalewisdom data shows. Still, Heico only makes up 0.07% of Berkshire's portfolio. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) dominates as the top holding at 31%, even after Buffett halved his holdings during the quarter. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) rank second and third, representing 12.9% and 11.9% of the portfolio, respectively.  
whalewisdom 的数据显示，伯克希尔在第二季度以每股 165 股左右的价格购买了 104.4 万股 HEI，市值超过 1.8537 亿美元。尽管如此，Heico 仅占伯克希尔投资组合的 0.07%。**苹果** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 以 31% 的持股占据主导地位，即使在巴菲特在本季度将持股减半之后也是如此。**美国运通** （[AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)） 和美国**银行** （[BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)） 排名第二和第三，分别占投资组合的 12.9% 和 11.9%。


For Heico's upcoming Q4 results, FactSet analysts expect earnings to increase 32% to 98 cents per share on 10.5% revenue growth to $1.03 billion, which would mark a quarterly record.  
对于 Heico 即将到来的第四季度业绩，FactSet 分析师预计收益将增长 32% 至每股 98 美分，收入增长 10.5% 至 10.3 亿美元，这将创下季度纪录。

**Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday as shares of the jet engine and defense components supplier close in on a buy point. Investment guru Warren Buffett earlier this summer opened up a new position in Heico and loaded up on shares.  




Hollywood, Fla.-based Heico produces parts, electronics and control and test systems for customers in the defense and aerospace industries. The company's products are found on a variety of industrial turbines, targeting systems, missiles and electro-optical devices.  


Heico's earnings growth rebounded over the last three quarters, to a 31% gain for its Q3 report in August, after slowing to a 6% increase in Q4 of last year. The defense contractor averaged 43.5% revenue growth over that period, driven by strong demand for aftermarket parts within its Flight Support Group division. However, sales growth decelerated modestly to a 37% gain for its most recent report.  


Still, Heico's roughly 36% gain in 2024 through the beginning of August was enough to pique the interest of investment oracle Buffett.  


**Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), [Warren Buffett's investment firm, bought shares of Heico](https://www.investors.com/news/warren-buffett-q2-2024-stock-buys-sells-berkshire-hathaway-13f/) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) during the second quarter, according to the fund's regulatory filings tracked by [whalewisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc).  


Berkshire purchased 1.044 million shares of HEI in Q2 at around 165 per share, with a market value of over $185.37 million, whalewisdom data shows. Still, Heico only makes up 0.07% of Berkshire's portfolio. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) dominates as the top holding at 31%, even after Buffett halved his holdings during the quarter. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) rank second and third, representing 12.9% and 11.9% of the portfolio, respectively.  


For Heico's upcoming Q4 results, FactSet analysts expect earnings to increase 32% to 98 cents per share on 10.5% revenue growth to $1.03 billion, which would mark a quarterly record.

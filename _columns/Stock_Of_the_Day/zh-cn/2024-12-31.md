**Adtalem Global Education** ([ATGE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATGE)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the leading provider of health care education, which has bet on artificial intelligence to help train health care professionals, traded just below a traditional buy point in stock market action.


Based in Chicago, Adtalem offers a range of academic programs aligned with health care industry needs. With nearly 10,000 employees and its network of institutions, Adtalem serves more than 90,000 students. It has a community of about 350,000 alumni, according to the company.




In September, [Adtalem partnered with Hippocratic AI](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240910680716/en/Hippocratic-AI-and-Adtalem-Forms-Innovative-Partnership-to-Advance-Healthcare-Education) to advance health care education using artificial intelligence. Hippocratic AI is building the first large language model that focuses on safety for health care. Through the collaboration, Adtalem aims to integrate nurses' practical experience with the advanced capabilities of artificial intelligence.


Meanwhile, at the [Google Cloud Next conference in May](https://www.adtalem.com/newsroom/articles/artificial-intelligence-as-a-catalyst-for-personalized-learning), Adtalem's Chief Customer Officer Steven Tom shared examples of Adtalem's AI journey. He highlighted Adtalem's AI-powered digital human and its collaboration with **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google on an AI-powered tutor named "Julian" â€” one of the first large-language-model applications in higher education.


Along with its push into the AI space, Adtalem earnings have rebounded to a 39% gain vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Analysts project the bottom line rising 18% to $5.89 a share in the fiscal year ending in June 2025.


Despite the expected earnings growth, analyst coverage of ATGE has been sparse, according to FactSet analysis. Still, at the end of October, Barrington analysts raised their stock price target to 95 from 90 while BMO Capital hiked its target to 90 from 84.

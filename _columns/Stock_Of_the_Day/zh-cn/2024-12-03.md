Singapore-based internet services company **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). U.S.-listed Sea stock is hovering near 52-week highs following a strong earnings report that highlighted the company's e-commerce strengths amid fierce competition.  
总部位于新加坡的互联网服务公司 **Sea Ltd.** （[SE）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE) 是周二的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)。在美国上市的 Sea 股票徘徊在 52 周高点附近，此前一份强劲的收益报告突出了该公司在激烈竞争中的电子商务优势。




Sea is the owner of the Shopee e-commerce network, which is popular in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Shopee also has expanded to Brazil and other parts of Latin America.  
Sea 是 Shopee 电子商务网络的所有者，该网络在东南亚和台湾很受欢迎。Shopee 还扩展到巴西和拉丁美洲的其他地区。


Sea stock has surged more than 180% this year. The huge rally has been helped by Shopee's momentum, as Sea faces challengers for the online shopping in Southeast Asia, including from TikTok, **PDD Holdings**' ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) Temu and **Alibaba**'s ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) Lazada.  
今年，海资源量激增了 180% 以上。Shopee 的势头帮助了这一大幅反弹，因为 Sea 在东南亚的网上购物面临挑战者，包括 TikTok、**拼多多**控股 （[PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)） 的 Temu 和**阿里巴巴** （[BABA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA) 的 Lazada。


"Shopee has achieved market share gains and profits while some competitors have struggled," JPMorgan analyst Ranjan Sharma wrote in a recent client note. Sharma rates Sea stock a positive overweight.  
“Shopee 实现了市场份额和利润的增长，而一些竞争对手却陷入了困境，”摩根大通分析师 Ranjan Sharma 在最近的一份客户报告中写道。Sharma 将 Sea stock 评为正面增持。


Sea's Bounceback Year Sea 的反弹年
------------------------------


Investor perception of Sea stands "in contrast," Sharma added, to discussions about the stock following its 2023 second-quarter results.  
Sharma 补充说，投资者对 Sea 的看法与 2023 年第二季度业绩后关于该股的讨论“形成鲜明对比”。


Sea stock fell by more than 30% in the back half of last year, after it declared with its Q2 results that it needed to [ramp up spending](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/se-stock-sea-limited-crashes-on-revenue-miss/) in response to increased competition. The company [swung to a loss the next quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/se-stock-sea-limited-q3-earnings-2023/).  
Sea Stock 在去年下半年下跌了 30% 以上，此前该公司在第二季度的业绩中宣布需要[增加支出](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/se-stock-sea-limited-crashes-on-revenue-miss/)以应对日益激烈的竞争。该公司[在下一个季度陷入亏损](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/se-stock-sea-limited-q3-earnings-2023/)。


But Sea's business is bouncing back this year. The company's [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sea-stock-sea-limited-q3-2024-news-se-stock/), reported Nov. 12, underscored that point. The company posted earnings of 24 cents per share, compared with a loss of 26 cents per share a year earlier.  
但 Sea 的业务今年正在反弹。该公司 11 月 12 日公布的[第三季度业绩](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sea-stock-sea-limited-q3-2024-news-se-stock/)强调了这一点。该公司公布的每股收益为 24 美分，而去年同期为每股亏损 26 美分。


Sales jumped 31% to $4.3 billion. That marked Sea's fastest growth since the first quarter of 2022. E-commerce related revenue grew 41% to $3.4 billion.  
销售额增长 31% 至 43 亿美元。这标志着 Sea 自 2022 年第一季度以来最快的增长。电子商务相关收入增长 41%，达到 34 亿美元。


Shopee turned a profit, on an adjusted basis, in both Asia and Brazil. Sea Chief Executive Forrest Li said in a news release that the company expects "Shopee to remain profitable going forward."  
Shopee 在亚洲和巴西均实现了调整后盈利。Sea 首席执行官 Forrest Li 在一份新闻稿中表示，该公司预计“Shopee 未来将保持盈利”。


Li also gave an upbeat forecast for Sea's digital-payments provider SeaMoney and Garena, a global online games developer.  
Li 还对 Sea 的数字支付提供商 SeaMoney 和全球在线游戏开发商 Garena 做出了乐观的预测。


Sea stock jumped 10.5% on the report.  
报告发布后，Sea stock 上涨 10.5%。


Deutsche Bank analyst Peter Milliken wrote following the report that "Sea's efforts to keep one eye on holding or gaining share and one eye on profitability, continues to succeed."  
德意志银行分析师 Peter Milliken 在报告发布后写道：“Sea 专注于持有或获得份额，同时关注盈利能力的努力继续取得成功。


Deutsche Bank has a neutral hold rating on Sea stock.  
德意志银行对 Sea stock 的评级为中性。


Sea Stock At Highest Level Since April 2022海库存量创 2022 年 4 月以来最高水平
-----------------------------------------------------------------


This year's rally continues a choppy run for Sea stock. The company was a Covid-era highflier, gaining more than 800% in a rally that stretched from March 2020 to November 2021.  
今年的涨势延续了 Sea stock 的震荡走势。该公司是 Covid 时代的高位上涨者，在 2020 年 3 月至 2021 年 11 月的反弹中上涨了 800% 以上。


But a steep [sell-off](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/se-stock-falls-pulls-ecommerce-unit-out-of-india/) in 2022 wiped out much of those gains. Sea's losses mounted and the market turned against money-losing tech firms. A focus on profitability sparked a comeback in the first half of 2023, before its slump to end the year.  
但 2022 年的大幅[抛售](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/se-stock-falls-pulls-ecommerce-unit-out-of-india/)抹去了大部分收益。Sea 的亏损加剧，市场转向反对亏损的科技公司。对盈利能力的关注在 2023 年上半年引发了反弹，然后在年底暴跌。


While still well off highs near 372 reached in late 2021, Sea stock is trading at its highest levels since April 2022.  
虽然 Sea 股票仍远低于 2021 年底触及的 372 附近的高点，但其交易价格处于 2022 年 4 月以来的最高水平。


Shares are trading tightly near a 52-week high of 117.85, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. Sea stock rose 2% to close at 115.48 on the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?)  
根据 [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) 图表，股价在 52 周高点 117.85 附近徘徊。Sea stock 今天在股市上上涨 2%，收于 115.48[。](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?)


While still early in the week, trading action so far show Sea could be working on a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/meta-stock-charts/), which would have a buy point of 117.85.  
虽然仍处于本周早些时候，但迄今为止的交易行动表明 Sea 可能正在形成[为期三周的紧身形态](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/meta-stock-charts/)，买入点为 117.85。


Sea's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near recent highs. The Relative Strength Rating is a strong 97 out of 99.

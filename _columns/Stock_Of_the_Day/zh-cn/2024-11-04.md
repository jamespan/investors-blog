JPMorgan Chase is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Monday. The Dow Jones financial giant is trading near record highs and just below a buy point after its mid-October earnings beat.  


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) on Oct. 11 reported Q3 earnings of $4.37 per share, handily beating FactSet expectations for $3.99 per share. Reported net revenue rose roughly 7% to $42.7 billion, which cleared estimates for $41.4 billion.  




JPMorgan saw assets under management increase by 23% to $3.9 trillion. Net interest income rose 3% to $23.5 billion. Average deposits were down 8% from last year, while average loans rose 1% from 2023.  


Investment banking revenue increased 29%, driven by a 31% jump in investment banking fees. Banking and wealth management revenue fell 11% due to lower interest income on deposits and lower deposit balances. However, home lending revenue rose 3%, while card services and auto revenue increased 11%.  


JPMorgan increased its provision for credit losses to $3.1 billion, from $1.38 billion for the same quarter last year.  


The bank guided 2024 net interest income around $92.5 billion, with an implied $22.9 billion in net interest income for Q4. FactSet analysts expect $92.2 billion in NII for the year, revised up from the previous outlook for $91 billion ahead of earnings. Analysts predict JPMorgan will generate $22.83 billion in net interest income for the fourth quarter.

----------------------


A number of firms lifted their price target after earnings, with RBC Capital noting that JPMorgan continues to deliver best-in-class results, The Fly reported.  
据 The Fly 报道，一些公司在财报发布后上调了目标价，RBC Capital 指出，摩根大通继续提供一流的业绩。


JPMorgan's diversified business model and billions in investments over the past decade have resulted in a fortress balance sheet and highly profitable banking model, RBC Capital wrote. RBC raised its price target on JPM stock to 230 from 211 and kept an outperform rating on the shares.  
RBC Capital 写道，摩根大通的多元化商业模式和过去十年数十亿美元的投资造就了坚固的资产负债表和高利润的银行模式。RBC 将摩根大通股票的目标价从 211 上调至 230，并维持对该股的跑赢大盘评级。


Meanwhile, Kenneth Leon, director of equity research at CFRA Research, forecasts that a strong economy will provide room for further growth, even if interest rates fall.  
与此同时，CFRA Research 股票研究主管 Kenneth Leon 预测，即使利率下降，强劲的经济也将为进一步增长提供空间。


"We believe a healthy U.S. economy will drive loan volume growth that will partly offset rate declines. Also, non-NII revenue from the Asset and Wealth Management and Corporate and Investment Banking units should benefit from lower rates," Leon wrote in a post-earnings note.  
“我们相信健康的美国经济将推动贷款量增长，这将部分抵消利率下降。此外，资产和财富管理部门以及企业和投资银行部门的非 NII 收入应该会受益于较低的利率，”Leon 在财报后的报告中写道。


CFRA Research maintained a buy rating on JPM stock with a 12-month price target of 230.  
CFRA Research 维持对摩根大源股票的买入评级，12 个月目标价为 230。

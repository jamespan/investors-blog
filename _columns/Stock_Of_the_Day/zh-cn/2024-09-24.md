**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the world's leading contract chipmaker continues to benefit as the go-to provider of cutting-edge chips for artificial intelligence and other applications. Meanwhile, TSM stock is in a buy zone.




While industry peer **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and others struggle to make chips at advanced nodes with the tiniest possible circuits, Taiwan Semiconductor has perfected the process. That's why customers like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **AMD** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) have flocked to its factories.


Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang praised Taiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Sept. 11.


"We're fabbing at a TSMC because it's the world's best. And it's the world's best not by a small margin. It's the world's best by just incredible margin," Huang said.


TSM Stock Is Recent Breakout
----------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), TSM stock rose 4.1% to close at 181.97.


On Thursday, TSM stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 175.45, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) extends to 184.22, based on [IBD trading principles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-rules-for-when-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-bull-and-bear-markets/).

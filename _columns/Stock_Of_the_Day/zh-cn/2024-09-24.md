**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the world's leading contract chipmaker continues to benefit as the go-to provider of cutting-edge chips for artificial intelligence and other applications. Meanwhile, TSM stock is in a buy zone.  
**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** （[TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)） 是[当今 IBD 股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为世界领先的合同芯片制造商继续受益于人工智能和其他应用的尖端芯片的首选供应商。与此同时，TSM 股票处于买入区域。




While industry peer **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and others struggle to make chips at advanced nodes with the tiniest possible circuits, Taiwan Semiconductor has perfected the process. That's why customers like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **AMD** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) have flocked to its factories.  
当行业同行**英特尔** （[INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)） 和其他公司努力在具有最小电路的先进节点上制造芯片时，台积电已经完善了这一工艺。这就是为什么 **Nvidia** （[NVDA）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)**AMD** （[AMD）、](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)**Apple** （[AAPL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL) 和 **Broadcom** （[AVGO）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO) 等客户纷纷涌入其工厂的原因。

英伟达首席执行官黄仁勋在9月11日的高盛共产主义与技术会议上赞扬了台湾半导体，更广为人知的名字是台积电。


"We're fabbing at a TSMC because it's the world's best. And it's the world's best not by a small margin. It's the world's best by just incredible margin," Huang said.  
“我们在台积电上制造，因为它是世界上最好的。这是世界上最好的，而不是小差。它是世界上最好的，差距令人难以置信，“黄仁勋说。

**Carnival Cruise** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. Carnival stock broke out as cruise lines rallied on strong momentum, with most set to report Q3 earnings this month.  
**Carnival Cruise** （[CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)） 是周三的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)。随着邮轮公司强劲势头反弹，嘉年华股票爆发，大多数公司将于本月公布第三季度收益。


Citigroup on Wednesday said its data analysis suggests the recent growth and rally in the cruise space "has real legs" into 2025 and beyond. The firm expects Carnival Cruise "should be able to generate substantial yield growth," based on recent trends and the contribution of its land-based assets like Celebration Key. Citi added that Carnival's debt and interest reduction should offset any sales growth sacrifices.  
花旗集团周三表示，其数据分析表明，邮轮领域最近的增长和反弹“在 2025 年及以后”有真正的优势”。该公司预计，根据最近的趋势以及 Celebration Key 等陆上资产的贡献，Carnival Cruise“应该能够产生可观的收益增长”。花旗补充说，嘉年华的债务和利息减少应该会抵消任何销售增长的牺牲。


The firm lifted its price target on Carnival Cruise stock to 28 from 25 and kept a buy rating on the shares.  
该公司将嘉年华邮轮股票的目标价从 25 上调至 28，并维持对该股的买入评级。




Citi also upgraded **Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) and opened a "90-day positive catalyst watch" for **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), as part of the [earnings preview for the industry](https://www.investors.com/news/royal-caribbean-norwegian-cruise-line-upgrade-target-hike/).  
花旗还上调**了挪威邮轮控股公司** （[NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)） 的评级，并为**皇家加勒比** （[RCL）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL) 开启了“90 天积极催化剂观察”，作为[该行业收益预览](https://www.investors.com/news/royal-caribbean-norwegian-cruise-line-upgrade-target-hike/)的一部分。


The firm upgraded Norwegian Cruise Line to buy from neutral and raised its price target to 30, up from 20, citing its recent strategy shift. Norwegian Cruise in May announced its new ["Charting the Course" strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/viking-holdings-vik-stock-breaks-out-cruise-lines-sail-norwegian-cruise/), which includes investment initiatives in the company culture and employees, guest product offerings, Norwegian's growth platform, as well as optimizing performance.  
该公司将挪威邮轮公司评级上调至“买入”，并从中性上调至买入，并将目标价从20上调至30，理由是其最近的战略转变。挪威邮轮公司 （Norwegian Cruise） 于 5 月宣布了其新的[“规划路线”战略](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/viking-holdings-vik-stock-breaks-out-cruise-lines-sail-norwegian-cruise/)，其中包括对公司文化和员工、宾客产品供应、挪威航空增长平台以及优化绩效的投资计划。


The firm estimates that Norwegian could achieve 23% annual earnings growth over the next three years. That could stretch closer to 30% if the cruise operator can sustain its 2.5% yield/cost spread. Either outcome equates to "big earnings upside and multiple expansion," opportunities Citi wrote.  
该公司估计，Norwegian 在未来三年内可实现 23% 的年收益增长。如果邮轮运营商能够维持其 2.5% 的收益率/成本差价，这可能会接近 30%。花旗写道，这两种结果都等同于“巨大的盈利增长和多重扩张”的机会。


The firm also expects Royal Caribbean to announce a long-term plan within the next two quarters, likely in conjunction with its Q3 or Q4 report. Citi said it doesn't see any reason that the cruise operator can't achieve $20 per share in earnings.  
该公司还预计 Royal Caribbean 将在未来两个季度内宣布一项长期计划，可能会与其第三季度或第四季度报告一起宣布。花旗表示，它认为没有任何理由认为这家邮轮运营商不能实现每股 20 美元的收益。


"While this would be a bold target at first blush, we do not believe that the building blocks are overly optimistic," Citi wrote. Citi hiked its price target on Royal Caribbean stock to $253 from $204 and kept a buy rating on the shares.  
“虽然乍一看这将是一个大胆的目标，但我们并不认为这些基石过于乐观，”花旗写道。花旗将皇家加勒比股票的目标价从 204 美元上调至 253 美元，并维持对该股的买入评级。


Carnival Cruise Earnings Carnival Cruise 财报
-------------------------------------------


The Citi note comes after Carnival Cruise [reported Q3 results on Sept. 30](https://www.investors.com/news/carnival-stock-q3-earnings-2024/), which kicked off earnings for the group.  
花旗说明是在嘉年华邮轮[于 9 月 30 日报告第三季度业绩](https://www.investors.com/news/carnival-stock-q3-earnings-2024/)之后发布的，该财报拉开了该集团收益的序幕。


Carnival earnings per share jumped 48% to $1.27 adjusted. FactSet expected adjusted EPS of $1.17. Revenue increased 15% to a record $7.89 billion, topping views for $7.82 billion.  
Carnival 调整后每股收益增长 48% 至 1.27 美元。FactSet 预计调整后每股收益为 1.17 美元。收入增长 15%，达到创纪录的 78.9 亿美元，超过预期的 78.2 亿美元。


The cruise line's revenue growth has slowed over the last seven quarters after rebounding following the coronavirus pandemic.  
该邮轮公司的收入增长在新冠病毒大流行后反弹后，在过去七个季度中有所放缓。


Carnival also noted record operating income of $2.2 billion, up $554 million from last year.  
嘉年华还指出，营业收入达到创纪录的 22 亿美元，比去年增长 5.54 亿美元。


CEO Josh Weinstein said unit operating income increased 26% due to operational improvements and high-margin, same-ship yield growth. Carnival's advanced booked position for 2025 is already ahead of 2024's record, with higher prices than last year. Weinstein added that Carnival is well-positioned with a stronger base of business for 2025 and set for a record start to 2026.  
首席执行官 Josh Weinstein 表示，由于运营改善和高利润率、同船收益增长，单位营业收入增长了 26%。嘉年华 2025 年的提前预订位置已经超过了 2024 年的记录，价格高于去年。Weinstein 补充说，Carnival 处于有利地位，到 2025 年拥有更强大的业务基础，并将在 2026 年创下创纪录的开端。


"With nearly half of 2025 booked and less inventory remaining for sale than the prior year, we are leveraging strong demand to achieve record ticket pricing," Weinstein said in the release. "Likewise, 2026 is off to an unprecedented start achieving record booking volumes in the last three months."  
“2025 年的预订量接近一半，剩余待售库存比上一年少，我们正在利用强劲的需求来实现创纪录的票价，”Weinstein 在新闻稿中说。“同样，2026 年将迎来前所未有的开端，在过去三个月中实现了创纪录的预订量。”


The cruise giant expects net yields to increase about 10.4% compared to last year, up from its June guidance of 10.25% growth. Carnival Cruise sees adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increasing around 40% to about $6 billion, increasing from its Q2 guidance for $5.83 billion. FactSet expects full-year EBITDA of $5.92 billion.  
这家邮轮巨头预计净收益率将比去年增长约 10.4%，高于 6 月份 10.25% 的增长指导。Carnival Cruise 预计调整后的息税折旧摊销前利润增长约 40% 至约 60 亿美元，高于第二季度的 58.3 亿美元。FactSet 预计全年 EBITDA 为 59.2 亿美元。


For Q4, Carnival expects net yields up 5% with a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $1.14 billion. Analysts predict Q4 EBITDA of $1.16 billion.  
对于第四季度，Carnival 预计净收益率将增长 5%，调整后 EBITDA 增长 20% 至 11.4 亿美元。分析师预测第四季度 EBITDA 为 11.6 亿美元。

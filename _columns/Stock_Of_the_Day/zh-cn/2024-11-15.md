Home Depot is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Friday. Shares of Dow Jones retailer are rebounding off key technical support after earnings as they work on a new base.  
家得宝是周五的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)。道琼斯零售商的股价在财报发布后从关键技术支撑位反弹，因为他们在新的基础上努力。




**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) on [Tuesday topped Q3 analyst estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-earnings-q3-home-depot-lowes/) and narrowed its 2024 guidance.  
**家得宝** （[HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)） [周二超过了分析师的第三季度预期](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-earnings-q3-home-depot-lowes/)，并缩小了 2024 年的指引。


The home improvement retailer reported adjusted earnings of $3.78 per share, down 0.8%, on 6.8% revenue growth to $40.22 billion.  
这家家装零售商报告称，调整后每股收益为 3.78 美元，下降 0.8%，收入增长 6.8% 至 402.2 亿美元。


FactSet expected a 4% earnings decline on $39.3 billion in sales.  
FactSet 预计销售额为 393 亿美元，收益将下降 4%。


Comparable sales fell for the eighth consecutive quarter, sliding 1.3% in Q3, with a 1.2% slip in the U.S. The last time Home Depot posted an increase to same-store sales was Q3 2022.  
可比销售额连续第八个季度下降，第三季度下滑 1.3%，美国下滑 1.2%。家得宝上一次公布同店销售额增长是在 2022 年第三季度。


"As weather normalized, we saw better engagement across seasonal goods and certain outdoor projects, as well as incremental sales related to hurricane demand," Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in the Q3 earnings release. However, he warned that "macroeconomic uncertainty remains."  
“随着天气正常化，我们看到季节性商品和某些户外项目的参与度更高，以及与飓风需求相关的销售额增加，”家得宝首席执行官 Ted Decker 在第三季度财报中表示。然而，他警告说，“宏观经济不确定性仍然存在”。


Home Depot narrowed its earnings guidance, now expecting a 1% decline in adjusted EPS for the year, vs. its prior forecast for a 1% to 3% drop. The company hiked its sales outlook, expecting 4% growth, from its previous outlook for a 2.5% to 3.5% increase. Home Depot also noted that it expects "some impact" from potential tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump plans to implement. But the Dow retailer says it sources over half of its products in North America, so it is "confident" in its ability to "manage through" cost hikes, which would affect the entire industry.  
家得宝缩小了其盈利指引，现在预计今年调整后每股收益将下降 1%，而之前预测的下降为 1% 至 3%。该公司上调了销售预期，预计增长 4%，高于之前的 2.5% 至 3.5% 的增长。家得宝还指出，预计当选总统唐纳德·特朗普计划实施的潜在关税将产生“一些影响”。但陶氏零售商表示，其一半以上的产品来自北美，因此它对“管理”成本上涨的能力“充满信心”，这将影响整个行业。


A number of firms hiked their price targets on Home Depot stock after results.  
财报公布后，一些公司上调了 Home Depot 股票的目标价。


Evercore ISI noted that Home Depot's comparable transaction decline was the "best since fall started" following an extended period of negative traffic, and forecasts earnings reach $17 for 2026. Evercore raised its price target on HD stock by $10 to 430 and kept an outperform rating on the shares.  
Evercore ISI 指出，在长时间的负流量之后，家得宝的可比交易下降是“自秋季开始以来最好的”，并预测 2026 年的收益将达到 17 美元。Evercore 将 HD 股票的目标价上调 10 美元至 430 美元，并维持对该股的跑赢大盘评级。


Loop Capital in a Wednesday note wrote that it is turning more bullish on sales trends as the Federal Reserve moves to lower interest rates. Meanwhile, recent hurricanes and storms should lift demand. Loop raised its price target on HD to 465 from 460 and maintained a buy rating on the stock.  
Loop Capital 在周三的一份报告中写道，随着美联储开始降低利率，它正在变得更加看好销售趋势。与此同时，最近的飓风和风暴应该会提振需求。Loop 将其对 HD 的目标价从 460 上调至 465，并维持对该股的买入评级。


Stifel on Thursday also lauded the results, but its revenue outlook "remains largely unchanged" as it expects "a tepid home improvement category recovery." The firm raised its price target by $5 to 405 and kept a hold rating on shares.  
Stifel 周四也赞扬了这一结果，但其收入前景“基本保持不变”，因为它预计“家装品类的复苏不温不火”。该公司将目标价上调 5 美元至 405 美元，并维持对股票的持有评级。

-------------------------------------------



HD stock inched up slightly Friday.  
HD 股票周五小幅上涨。


Shares are working on a short consolidation, which could form into a real base if given another week.  
股票正在进行短期盘整，如果再给一周时间，可能会形成一个真正的底部。


The current pattern looks like a mini [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), appearing as part of a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). The latest consolidation could be viewed as a handle to a massive base, going all the way back to December 2021.  
目前的模式看起来像一个[带手柄的迷你杯子底座](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/)，看起来像一个[底座对底座结构](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/)的一部分。最新的整合可以被视为对庞大基础的处理，一直追溯到 2021 年 12 月。


HD stock is currently bouncing off support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). If shares rebounded above their weekly high of 416.02, that would indicate an [early entry opportunity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) for investors.

Shares have a 61 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), based on its string of earnings declines over the last seven quarters. HD stock has a 78 [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) as its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has rebounded from early November lows.

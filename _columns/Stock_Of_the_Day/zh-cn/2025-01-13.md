**Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), flexing relative strength and tight trading ahead of a potential breakout. Planet Fitness stock is also receiving key support after rapid growth fueled a rally to all-time highs.


On Monday, the "judgment free" gym operator reported 19.7 million members in 2024 — jumping from 18 million in 2023. Same-club sales grew by 5%. Those gains came despite the first price increase for new members in more than 25 years.




The leisure company, known for its $10 basic gym membership, announced in May 2024 that it will increase prices for new members to $15 per month. It is set to report earnings on Feb. 25.


Planet Fitness Stock Performance
--------------------------------


Shares rose 0.1% to 101.56 in Monday's [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Planet Fitness stock found support at the 50-day/10-week moving averages on Monday. It has been trading around the 21-day exponential moving average for several weeks. That is a sign of strength in the current volatile market.



The PLNT stock chart shows tight action over the past several weeks, following an earnings breakaway gap in November, according to [MarketSurge charts](https://marketsurge.investors.com). Aggressive investors could treat this as a flat base with a 102.90 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/). It could turn into an official flat base after Friday.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for Planet Fitness stock is making a new high, a favorable sign ahead of a potential breakout. The RS line rallied in the past year but remains below pre-pandemic highs. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart provided.


A 92 RS Rating means that this fitness stock has outperformed 92% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.


In IBD's Leisure Services industry group, [cruise stocks are acting well](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-cruise-lines-travel-industry-rally-2025-outlook/) and several hold a high RS score.


So does fitness equipment maker **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), with an RS of 98. **Life Time Group Holdings** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)), another athletic club operator, has a 90 RS Rating. Peloton stock is working on a new base after surging in late 2024 from record lows, but is just below its 50-day line. Life Time stock is just above its 50-day line within a base.


Bear in mind that last week's stock and bond sell-off shifted the [stock market status](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/). IBD advised investors to reduce their exposure to 20%-40%.


Planet Fitness Earnings
-----------------------


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-peloton-interactive-pton.aspx) tool shows that Planet Fitness stock earns a [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1) of 89 out of 99. The rating rolls various fundamental and technical metrics into one easy-to-use score.


It bears an EPS Rating of 92, out of a best-possible 99.


Over the past three years, Planet Fitness grew earnings per share at an impressive 52% compound rate, recovering from a 2020 slump due to pandemic lockdowns. Over the past three quarters, the company averaged 16% earnings growth, well below the 3-year rate, and slowing to 8% in the latest quarter.


However, Planet Fitness raised its full-year earnings and revenue outlook in November. It also began a new $500 million share repurchase program.


Amid the membership fee hikes, analysts expect earnings growth to reach 12% in 2024 and 17% in 2025.


Budget Gym Chain A Top Pick After Membership Price Hikes
--------------------------------------------------------


In December, analysts at RBC Capital named Planet Fitness stock a top pick for 2025.


The gym operator's price increases are below inflation and it is performing better than expected, RBC Capital analyst Logan Rech said.


Planet Fitness attracted customers by offering access to a range of strength and cardio equipment for a low membership fee. Changes to Planet Fitness club formats are now improving member experience and drawing a broader audience, Rech said, according to TheFly.com.


As of Q3 2024, roughly a quarter (26%) of members had incomes under $50,000, a Planet Fitness investor presentation shows. More than a third (35%) had incomes above $100,000.

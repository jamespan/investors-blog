Robinhood is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday. Shares of the brokerage platform rallied in early trade to clear a buy point.  
Robinhood 是周二[的 IBD 股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)。该经纪平台的股价在早盘交易中上涨，清除了一个买入点。


**Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) spiked Tuesday after Barclays on Monday raised its price target on HOOD stock. Barclays, in an earnings preview for brokers, asset managers and exchanges, wrote that we continue to get closer to a "normal" market environment. The initial public offering market and merger markets are "showing signs of life," according to the firm. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve rate expectations are "driving renewed optimism."  
在巴克莱周一上调 HOOD 股票的目标价后，**Robinhood** （[HOOD）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD) 周二飙升。巴克莱银行在为经纪商、资产管理公司和交易所提供的收益预览中写道，我们继续接近“正常”的市场环境。该公司表示，首次公开募股市场和合并市场“显示出复苏的迹象”。与此同时，美联储的利率预期正在“推动新的乐观情绪”。


However, Barclays noted that Q3 itself has seen softer-than-expected activity for the industry groups. The firm lifted its price target on Robinhood to 23 from 20 and maintained an equal weight rating on the shares.  
然而，巴克莱指出，第三季度本身，各行业团体的活动低于预期。该公司将 Robinhood 的目标价从 20 上调至 23，并维持对该股的同等权重评级。




Robinhood Momentum
------------------


Separately, Deutsche Bank on Sept. 30 said it remains "encouraged" by Robinhood's revenue and earnings momentum. The company has a range of initiatives to bring more customers to the platform, leverage addressable markets and deepen user activity.  
另外，德意志银行 （Deutsche Bank） 于 9 月 30 日表示，它仍然对 Robinhood 的收入和盈利势头感到“鼓舞”。该公司采取了一系列举措，为平台带来更多客户，利用潜在市场并深化用户活动。


Deutsche Bank sees Robinhood generating net new assets at an annualized pace of over 20% through 2025, slowing to 20% in 2026. This should help enable continued adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and "strong" double-digit earnings growth in 2025 and 2026. Deutsche Bank raised its price target on HOOD stock to 27 from 24 and kept a buy rating on the shares.  
德意志银行预计，到 2025 年，Robinhood 将以超过 20% 的年化速度产生净新资产，到 2026 年将放缓至 20%。这应该有助于在 2025 年和 2026 年实现调整后 EBITDA 利润率的持续增长和“强劲”的两位数盈利增长。德意志银行将 HOOD 股票的目标价从 24 上调至 27，并维持对该股的买入评级。


Citi also lifted its price target on HOOD stock to 23 from 19 on Sept. 27, citing strong net deposit trends and trading activity in recent periods. The firm has a neutral rating on the shares. All broker information from Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Citi was reported by The Fly.  
花旗还将 HOOD 股票的目标价从 9 月 27 日的 19 上调至 23，理由是近期强劲的净存款趋势和交易活动。该公司对这些股票的评级为中性。来自巴克莱银行、德意志银行和花旗的所有经纪人信息均由 The Fly 报道。

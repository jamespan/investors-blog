**Meta Platforms** ([IBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBD)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Friday. Shares of the Facebook parent company are chasing a 602.95 flat-base buy point but could also be actionable as they move above Meta's 50-day line.  
**Meta Platforms** （[IBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBD)） 是周五[的 IBD 股票](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)。Facebook 母公司的股票正在追逐 602.95 的平底买入点，但也可能在突破 Meta 的 50 天线时采取行动。


Meta stock rose 0.9% to close at 574.32 on the [stock market Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?). The stock hit a record high at 602.95 on Oct. 7 but have pulled back in the weeks since.  
[Meta 股票周五在股市](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?)上上涨 0.9%，收于 574.32。该股在 10 月 7 日创下 602.95 的历史新高，但此后几周内有所回落。




Overall, shares have gained 61% this year, helped by strong growth from Meta's massive digital advertising business and optimism about Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's [AI investments](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-zuckerberg-orion-smart-glasses-facebook/). Revenue grew by more than 20% for the Facebook and Instagram owner for four straight quarters before easing back to 19% in its most recent third-quarter report against tougher comparisons.  
总体而言，今年股价上涨了 61%，这得益于 Meta 大规模数字广告业务的强劲增长以及对首席执行官马克扎克伯格 [AI 投资](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-zuckerberg-orion-smart-glasses-facebook/)的乐观情绪。Facebook 和 Instagram 所有者的收入连续四个季度增长超过 20%，然后在最近的第三季度报告中回落至 19%，与更严格的比较相比。


There are challenges ahead for the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks/) stock. Investors are uneasy about how much the social media giant will need to spend on its AI vision. And lawmakers worldwide are scrutinizing the effects of social media on young users, underscored by Australia approving a ban on social media for users under age 16 Thursday.  
[Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks/) 股票面临挑战。投资者对这家社交媒体巨头需要为其 AI 愿景投入多少感到不安。世界各地的立法者都在仔细审查社交媒体对年轻用户的影响，澳大利亚周四批准禁止 16 岁以下用户使用社交媒体就证明了这一点。


Meta Shares Tread Water In Q4Meta 股价在第四季度踩水
-------------------------------------------


Despite its big gains year to date, Meta stock has been flat since October. The Zuckerberg-led company saw its [stock fall slightly following third-quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/) earnings in late October. Shares also fell slightly the day [after Donald Trump](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-trump-zuckerberg-trump-2024-election/)'s election to a second presidential term, despite the broader market rallying on the news.  
尽管年初至今大幅上涨，但 Meta 股票自 10 月以来一直持平。这家由扎克伯格领导的公司在 10 月下旬[发布第三季度财报后，其股价略有下跌](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/)。在[唐纳德·特朗普](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-trump-zuckerberg-trump-2024-election/)当选第二个总统任期后的第二天，股价也略有下跌，尽管大盘因这一消息而反弹。


For the earnings report, Meta's results beat expectations for both earnings and revenue. But investors fretted as Meta again upped its estimates for capital expenditures, as the company spends big on chips from **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and other costs to build computing capacity for AI.  
对于收益报告，Meta 的收益和收入均超出预期。但投资者感到不安，因为 Meta 再次上调了对资本支出的估计，因为该公司在 **Nvidia** （[NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)） 的芯片和其他成本上投入了大量资金来建立 AI 的计算能力。


Zuckerberg has told investors the company's spending can pay off through increased engagement on its platforms and new ad products for businesses. The social media giant [recently hired](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-hires-former-salesforce-ai-boss-for-big-step-in-enterprise/) former Salesforce AI leader Clara Shih to lead a new business AI group.  
扎克伯格告诉投资者，该公司的支出可以通过增加其平台上的参与度和为企业提供新的广告产品来获得回报。这家社交媒体巨头[最近聘请](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-hires-former-salesforce-ai-boss-for-big-step-in-enterprise/)了前 Salesforce AI 负责人 Clara Shih 来领导一个新的商业 AI 小组。


And following Donald Trump's election win, investors may have been concerned about tensions between Zuckerberg and Trump, who was suspended from [posting on Facebook and Instagram](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-ban-of-trump-could-be-lifted-in-2023/) for two years following the 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. Zuckerberg appears to be trying to patch things up. The Facebook founder visited Trump in Florida on Wednesday, according to the [New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-trump-meeting.html)  
在唐纳德·特朗普赢得大选后，投资者可能一直担心扎克伯格与特朗普之间的紧张关系，特朗普在 2021 年美国国会大厦骚乱后被暂停[在 Facebook 和 Instagram 上发帖](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-ban-of-trump-could-be-lifted-in-2023/)两年。扎克伯格似乎正在努力修补事情。据《[纽约时报》](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-trump-meeting.html)报道，这位 Facebook 创始人周三在佛罗里达州拜访了特朗普。


Still, there are other regulatory concerns to watch for Meta. Lawmakers in Australia on Thursday approved a ban on social media for users under 16 years old. A Meta spokesperson told [Reuters](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-passes-social-media-ban-132226226.html) that the bill appeared rushed and there should be a "productive consultation" for how the rules are enforced. The bill highlights growing focus on the effects of social media on young users. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in a June [New York Times op-ed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label/) that social media should come with a warning label for young users.  
尽管如此，Meta 还有其他监管问题需要关注。澳大利亚立法者周四批准了一项禁止 16 岁以下用户在社交媒体上的行为。Meta 发言人告诉[路透社](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-passes-social-media-ban-132226226.html)，该法案似乎很仓促，应该就如何执行这些规则进行“富有成效的磋商”。该法案凸显了人们对社交媒体对年轻用户影响的日益关注。美国卫生局局长维韦克·穆尔蒂 （Vivek Murthy） 在 6 月[的《纽约时报》专栏文章](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label/)中写道，社交媒体应该为年轻用户贴上警告标签。

Meta Stock In Flat Base平底 Meta Stock
------------------------------------


Still, the markets appeared to brush off concerns about the Australia law. Meta stock opened ahead as U.S. markets resumed trading following Thanksgiving.  
尽管如此，市场似乎对澳大利亚法律的担忧不屑一顾。随着美国市场在感恩节后恢复交易，Meta 股票开盘领先。


Shares are in an eight-week-long flat base. Meta stock is roughly 5% below the 602.95 buy point in Friday's shortened trading day. A move above that entry point would put Meta back into record-high territory.  
股价处于长达八周的平坦底部。在周五缩短的交易日，Meta 股票比 602.95 的买入点低约 5%。突破该切入点将使 Meta 回到创纪录的高位。


But Meta overtook its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on Friday, making the stock actionable for more-aggressive investors.  
但 Meta 周五突破了其 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/)，这使得该股对更激进的投资者具有可操作性。


Meta's Relative Strength Rating is at 82 out of 99, meaning it has outperformed 82% of stocks tracked by IBD based on price performance. That's fallen slightly from an RS score of 92 last month.  
Meta 的相对强弱评级为 82 分（满分 99 分），这意味着根据价格表现，它的表现优于 IBD 跟踪的 82% 的股票。这比上个月的 RS 分数 92 分略有下降。


[Meanwhile. Meta](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-meta-platforms-meta.aspx) shows a 95 out of a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating, per the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). It is the third-highest-rated stock out of 69 members in the internet content group tracked by IBD.  
[同时。根据](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-meta-platforms-meta.aspx) [IBD 股票检查](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)，Meta 显示完美的 95 IBD 综合评分中的 99 分。它是 IBD 跟踪的互联网内容组 69 名成员中评分第三高的股票。

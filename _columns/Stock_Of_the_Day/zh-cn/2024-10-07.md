**Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) is Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day, as Hurricane Milton grows into a Category 5 storm, heading for Florida just days after Hurricane Helene [ripped through the Southeastern](https://www.investors.com/news/hurricane-helene-34-billion-price-tag-stock-market-impact/) U.S. Generac jumped into a buy zone Monday following an upgrade and is flashing some bullish signals.  
**Generac** （[GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)） 是周一的今日 IBD 股票，因为飓风米尔顿发展成 5 级风暴，在飓风海伦席[卷美国东南部](https://www.investors.com/news/hurricane-helene-34-billion-price-tag-stock-market-impact/)几天后前往佛罗里达州。Generac 在上调后周一跃入买入区域，并发出一些看涨信号。


OTR Global upgraded the Waukesha, Wis.-based Generac with a positive rating, up from mixed, on Monday. The firm cited research that shows that third-quarter U.S. residential sales of standby generators increased on a dollar basis vs. a year ago. The 2024 outlook is for continued growth.  
OTR Global 周一将总部位于威斯康星州沃基夏的 Generac 评级从喜忧参半上调至正面评级。该公司援引研究表明，与一年前相比，第三季度美国备用发电机的住宅销售额有所增长。2024 年的前景是持续增长。


Meanwhile, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified on Monday. The National Hurricane Center expects Milton to weaken before hitting Florida's west coast on Tuesday or Wednesday. Hurricane Milton was a Category 1 storm late Sunday but has quickly strengthened in recent hours.  
与此同时，飓风米尔顿周一迅速增强。国家飓风中心预计，米尔顿将在周二或周三袭击佛罗里达州西海岸之前减弱。飓风米尔顿是周日晚些时候的 1 级风暴，但在最近几个小时内迅速增强。

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has posted four straight quarters of triple-digit percentage earnings growth. Also, its sales growth has averaged 23% on a year-over-year basis over the past four quarters.

Intapp Stock Spikes Into Buy Zone
---------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Intapp stock jumped back into the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) of its Aug. 28 [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). On that day three weeks ago, it hit a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 45.43 out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. It reached a more than one-year high of 46.58 before pulling back in a broader market sell-off.


Its recent high of 46.58 was a follow-on, high-handle entry, according to [IBD stock analysis](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/). Intapp stock rose 6% to close at 47.51.


As of June 30, Intapp served more than 2,550 clients. Of those, 698 each had contracts for greater than $100,000 of annual recurring revenue. And 73 clients had contracts of more than $1 million, up from 53 such clients at the end of the prior fiscal year.


Microsoft Partnership Aids Growth Plan
--------------------------------------


On a conference call with analysts after the fiscal Q4 report, Intapp Chief Executive John Hall touted the benefits of his firm's partnership with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


"Our strategic partnership with Microsoft continues to support our global growth," Hall said.


"We enter fiscal year 2025 with optimism and confidence that our vertical SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform, applied AI strategy and strong competitive position are a strong foundation for sustained growth and execution in this large addressable market," he said.


For the September quarter, analysts polled by FactSet expect Intapp to earn an adjusted 13 cents a share, up 117%, on sales of $117.9 million, up 16%. Wall Street sees Intapp's earnings and sales growth slowing as the company faces more difficult year-over-year comparisons.


Intapp stock is on two IBD lists: [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight) and [Tech Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-tech-leaders-sep-13-2024/).

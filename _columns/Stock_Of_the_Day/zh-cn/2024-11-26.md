Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday as shares surged to a 10-year high.  
巴西航空航天制造商 Embraer 是周二的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为股价飙升至 10 年高点。




**Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. On the commercial front, Embraer is best-known for its Embraer 175 (E175) single-aisle planes. It also manufacturers the C-390 military transport aircraft. The company's Phenom 300 has been the world's bestselling light jet for the past 12 years, according to a [May announcement](https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207346-embraers-phenom-300-leads-the-industry-in-twinjet-deliveries-and-is-the-worlds-best-selling-light-jet-for-12-consecutive-years).  
**巴西航空工业公司** （[ERJ）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ) 生产一支由商用、公务和国防喷气式飞机组成的机队。在商业方面，Embraer 以其 Embraer 175 （E175） 单通道飞机而闻名。它还生产 C-390 军用运输机。根据 [5 月份的公告](https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207346-embraers-phenom-300-leads-the-industry-in-twinjet-deliveries-and-is-the-worlds-best-selling-light-jet-for-12-consecutive-years)，该公司的 Phenom 300 在过去 12 年中一直是世界上最畅销的轻型喷气式飞机。


Embraer is coming off its major [Q3 beat from Nov. 8](https://www.investors.com/news/embraer-maintains-revenue-growth-expectation/), which saw earnings increase to $1.20 per share from 18 cents the year prior. Revenue jumped 32% to $1.69 billion, with sales from its "executive aviation" and "defense and security" segments each increasing 65% compared with a year ago.  
巴西航空工业公司从 [11 月 8 日开始大幅打破第三季度](https://www.investors.com/news/embraer-maintains-revenue-growth-expectation/)的业绩，每股收益从去年同期的 18 美分增加到 1.20 美元。收入增长 32% 至 16.9 亿美元，其中“行政航空”和“国防和安全”部门的销售额与一年前相比分别增长了 65%。


The results were well above analyst expectations for earnings of 25 cents per share on $1.58 billion in revenue.  
该结果远高于分析师的预期，即每股收益 25 美分，营收为 15.8 亿美元。


Embraer delivered 59 aircraft during the quarter, a 37% increase from the year prior. Executive jet deliveries totaled 41, with 16 commercial jets and two multimission C-390 aircraft. The company said that its backlog at the end of the quarter was worth $22.7 billion, marking a nine-year high and up 25% from last year.  


Embraer narrowed its 2024 commercial aviation delivery forecast to 70-73 planes, down from its prior guidance for 72-80. The company maintained its executive delivery outlook of 125 to 135 jets.  


The Brazilian outfit also reiterated its full-year revenue forecast for $6 billion to $6.4 billion, with the midpoint just below analyst views for $6.3 billion.  
这家巴西公司还重申了其全年收入预测，即 60 亿至 64 亿美元，中点略低于分析师预期的 63 亿美元。


FactSet expects 2025 revenue increases to $7.26 billion, growing to about $8 billion in 2026.  
FactSet 预计 2025 年的收入将增加到 72.6 亿美元，到 2026 年将增长到约 80 亿美元。


Analysts Shift Targets, Ratings分析师改变目标、评级
-----------------------------------------


However, analyst ratings have been mixed in the wake of earnings.  
然而，在财报发布后，分析师的评级喜忧参半。


UBS in mid-November downgraded ERJ shares to sell from neutral, noting it thinks the market is "overoptimistic" heading into 2025, and results for the year may disappoint investors, The Fly reported. The firm wrote that the competitive environment is unfavorable to Embraer, as Brazil and other Latin American locations lack competitive advantages for its projects. Still UBS lifted its price target on ERJ shares to 32 from 29.  
据 The Fly 报道，瑞银在 11 月中旬将 ERJ 股票的评级从中性下调至卖出，并指出它认为市场对 2025 年“过于乐观”，今年的结果可能会让投资者失望。该公司写道，竞争环境对 Embraer 不利，因为巴西和其他拉丁美洲地区缺乏其项目的竞争优势。尽管如此，瑞银仍将 ERJ 股票的目标价从 29 上调至 32。


Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley and BofA both raised their targets on Embraer last week.  
在其他地方，摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）和美国银行（BofA）上周都上调了对巴西航空工业公司（Embraer）的目标。


Morgan Stanley cited Q3 results and the company's investor day presentation as evidence of "the company's strong operating performance and ongoing momentum." The firm raised its price target by $5 to 45 and kept an overweight rating on the shares.  


BofA on Thursday  also lifted its price target on Embraer to 55 from 40 and maintained a buy rating on the stock to reflect stronger-than-expected deliveries and demand. The firm said Embraer's greatest differentiating factor is that innovation is core to the company identity. BofA also credited Embraer's strong backlog, deliveries and improving financials as "a testament to the strategy working."

**Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it hugs a short-term support level while eyeing both an early entry and a more-traditional buy point. Cava stock continues its red-hot run after an August earnings beat-and-raise, near post-IPO highs.  
**Cava** （[CAVA）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA) 是[当今的 IBD 股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为它处于短期支撑位，同时着眼于早期入场和更传统的买入点。Cava 股票在 8 月份的收益超过预期并上调后，接近 IPO 后的高点，继续其炙手可热的走势。


The fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain specializes in build-your-own falafel bowls and pita sandwiches, made with hearty ingredients and bold flavors. Cava stock packs a punch, too, having nearly tripled year to date.  
这家快速休闲的地中海连锁餐厅专门提供自制的沙拉三明治碗和皮塔饼三明治，采用丰盛的食材和大胆的口味制成。卡瓦酒的股票也很有冲击力，年初至今几乎翻了三倍。




Founded in 2010, Cava delivered its first profit on an annual basis on 60% revenue growth in 2023, the year it went public. The Washington, D.C.-based company ties its rapid growth to new and repeat customers.  
Cava 成立于 2010 年，在 2023 年上市的那一年，以 60% 的收入增长实现了首次年度盈利。这家总部位于华盛顿特区的公司将其快速增长与新客户和回头客联系在一起。


Analysts call Cava the next **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)). That larger fast-casual peer, too, had landed huge success, with its customizable bowls underpinning rapid growth. Some investors may see a similar winning story in **Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)).  
分析师称 Cava 为下一个 **Chipotle Mexican Grill** （[CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)）。这家规模更大的休闲快餐店也取得了巨大成功，其可定制的碗为快速增长奠定了基础。一些投资者可能会在 **Sweetgreen** （[SG）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG) 中看到类似的成功故事。

**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Monday. Shares of the Facebook parent company have formed a flat base pattern after bouncing back last week from a slight earnings letdown.  
**Meta Platforms** （[META）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META) 是周一[的 IBD 股票](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)。Facebook 母公司的股价在上周从收益小幅下降中反弹后，已形成平坦的底部模式。




Meta stock has traded between a high of 602.95 — its flat base buy point, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/mstool) — and 555 since early October. In that time, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company saw its [stock fall slightly following third-quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/) earnings, and then again in the day following Donald Trump's election to a second presidential term.  
自 10 月初以来，Meta 股票的交易价格一直在 602.95（根据 [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/mstool) 的数据，其平坦的底部买入点）和 555 之间。在那段时间里，马克·扎克伯格领导的公司股价[在第三季度财报后小幅下跌](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/)，然后在唐纳德·特朗普当选第二个总统任期后的第二天再次下跌。


Investors are debating what impact Trump's policies will have on the stock, but are also keyed in on how much further Zuckerberg plans to splurge on artificial intelligence initiatives.  
投资者正在争论特朗普的政策将对该股产生什么影响，但也关注扎克伯格计划在人工智能计划上进一步挥霍多少。


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Meta stock slipped 1% to close at 583.17. Shares have gained 65% this year, compared to a 26% gain for the S&P 500.  
[今日](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?)股市上，Meta 股价下跌 1%，收于 583.17 点。今年，股价上涨了 65%，而标准普尔 500 指数上涨了 26%。


Meta Stock Left Out Of Initial Trump RallyMeta 股票被排除在特朗普最初的反弹之外
---------------------------------------------------------------


Meta stock posted a 4% gain in last week's trading, despite not trading higher with the rest of the market Wednesday following [Trump's victory](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-trump-zuckerberg-trump-2024-election/). While the S&P 500 index [rallied 2.5% on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-trump-media-tesla-tsla-stock/) following Trump's victory, Meta stock closed slightly lower on the day.  
Meta 股票在上周的交易中上涨了 4%，尽管在[特朗普获胜](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-trump-zuckerberg-trump-2024-election/)后周三与其他市场股的交易价格没有走高。虽然标准普尔 500 指数在特朗普获胜后周三[上涨 2.5%，](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-trump-media-tesla-tsla-stock/)但 Meta 股票当天收盘小幅走低。


Trump's election introduces an even bigger question mark for whether Meta rival TikTok will be banned. Trump said he was against the idea, prior to President Joe Biden [signing a bill into law](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tiktok-ban-passes-senate-oracle-meta-google/) this spring requiring TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the company by early next year.  
特朗普的当选为 Meta 的竞争对手 TikTok 是否会被禁止带来了一个更大的问号。特朗普表示，在乔·拜登总统今年春天[签署一项法案成为法律](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tiktok-ban-passes-senate-oracle-meta-google/)之前，他反对这个想法，要求 TikTok 母公司字节跳动在明年年初之前出售该公司。


"There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok," Trump said in a March interview with CNBC. "But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media."  
“TikTok 有很多好处，也有很多坏处，”特朗普在 3 月份接受 CNBC 采访时说。“但我不喜欢的是，没有 TikTok，你可以让 Facebook 变得更大，我认为 Facebook 和很多媒体都是人民的敌人。”


Analysts generally saw the TikTok ban as a positive for Meta and Snapchat parent **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), which both have short video products that compete against TikTok for user attention.  
分析师普遍认为 TikTok 禁令对 Meta 和 Snapchat 母公司 **Snap** （[SNAP）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP) 有利，这两家公司都有短视频产品与 TikTok 争夺用户注意力。


Still, Stifel analyst Mark Kelley wrote to clients last week that "social media fundamentals are unlikely to change from here, given we don't believe many investors were expecting a TikTok ban."  
尽管如此，Stifel 分析师 Mark Kelley 上周写信给客户表示，“社交媒体的基本面不太可能从这里开始发生变化，因为我们认为许多投资者不会预期 TikTok 会被禁止。


Trump's election is also likely to bring a lighter regulatory and antitrust enforcement environment, Kelley noted, and could prove neutral for Meta overall. Kelley rates Meta a buy.  
Kelley 指出，特朗普的当选也可能带来更轻松的监管和反垄断执法环境，并且可能对 Meta 整体保持中立。Kelley 将 Meta 评为买入。


Investors may have ultimately taken that view. Meta stock followed a weak trading day after the election with a 3.4% gain Thursday.  
投资者最终可能已经采取了这种观点。Meta 股票在大选后交易日表现疲软，周四上涨 3.4%。


Meta Earnings
-------------


Last week's gains helped Meta bounce back from a down trading week to close October. Meta on Oct. 30 posted [Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/) that cruised past top and bottom line estimates. Earnings gained 37% year over year to $6.03 per share. Sales increased 19% to $40.6 billion,  
上周的涨幅帮助 Meta 从下跌的交易周中反弹，收于 10 月。Meta 于 10 月 30 日公布了[第三季度的业绩](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-q3-2024-earnings-results-facebook-instagram/)，超过了营收和利润预期。收益同比增长 37% 至每股 6.03 美元。销售额增长 19% 至 406 亿美元，


But Meta stock fell 4% in next-day trading, however, as the stock bumped up against high expectations. The stock lost 1% for the trading week ending Nov. 1.  


In its Q3 report, Meta also slightly increased the midpoint of its guidance for 2024 capital expenditures by $1 billion, to $39 billion. Much of that spending is focused on building data centers and other infrastructure to power new AI products.  


During a call with analysts on Oct. 30, Zuckerberg said there are several opportunities to use AI to improve Meta's core business, and therefore it's worth further investment.  
在 10 月 30 日与分析师的电话会议上，扎克伯格表示，使用 AI 来改善 Meta 的核心业务有多种机会，因此值得进一步投资。


A key investor debate is just how much Meta will spend on capital expenditures in 2025. The company has yet to release an estimate but said in its Q3 news release that it expects "significant capital expenditures growth in 2025."  
一个关键的投资者争论是 Meta 将在 2025 年花费多少资本支出。该公司尚未发布估计值，但在其第三季度新闻稿中表示，预计“2025 年的资本支出将大幅增长”。


Analysts are forecasting $49.5 billion in capital expenditures for next year, according to FactSet, which would mark a 27% jump from Meta's expected 2024 spending.  
根据 FactSet 的数据，分析师预测明年的资本支出为 495 亿美元，这将比 Meta 预计的 2024 年支出增长 27%。


New Street Research analyst Dan Salmon said Meta stock could be "range-bound" for the next three months until the company provides guidance on 2025 capital expenditures and overall expenses.  
New Street Research 分析师 Dan Salmon 表示，Meta 股票可能在未来三个月“区间震荡”，直到该公司就 2025 年的资本支出和整体支出提供指导。


Meta Stock Forms Flat BaseMeta Stock Forms 平底
---------------------------------------------


Meta stock's 4% gain last week helped shares rebound above its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals) and retake its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The gains helped the Facebook and Instagram parent form a new flat, [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) pattern with a 602.95 buy point.  
Meta 股票上周上涨 4%，帮助股价反弹至 [10 周线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals)上方，并重新夺回 [21 天移动均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)。这些收益帮助 Facebook 和 Instagram 母公司形成了一个新的横盘、[基础模式](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/)，买入点为 602.95。


A high of 594.80 reached last Thursday could also offer an early entry for more aggressive investors.  
上周四触及的高点 594.80 也可能为更激进的投资者提供提前入场的机会。


Meanwhile, Meta's[Relative Strength](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Relative+Price+Strength+(RS)+Rating+or+Relative+Strength&termid=1) line is below a recent high but remains above 85 out of a best-possible 99, a sign of continuing bullishness compared to the rest of the market.  
与此同时，Meta 的[相对强弱](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Relative+Price+Strength+(RS)+Rating+or+Relative+Strength&termid=1)线低于近期高点，但仍高于 85 分（最佳 99 分），与市场其他部分相比，这表明市场持续看涨。


Meta stock shows a 96 out of a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) tool. It is the top-rated stock in the [Internet Content](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-reddit-stock-meta-stock-q3-preview/) group tracked by IBD.

**U.S. Foods** ([USFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USFD)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the food distributor looks to break out above a buy point before closing the book on 2024 next week.


The leading food service distributor partners with about 250,000 restaurants and food service operators. The Rosemont, Ill.,-based company also provides customers with e-commerce, technology and business solutions.


U.S. Foods reports fourth-quarter earnings and revenue before the market opens on Feb. 13. Analysts expect Q4 EPS to grow 25% to 80 cents with sales increasing 6% to $9.49 billion. That would be the third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth.




On Jan. 13, U.S. Foods reaffirmed 2024 guidance of net sales of $37.7 billion-$38 billion and full-year earnings of $3.05-$3.15 per share. USFD stock advanced 1.4% that week.


Following U.S. Food's decision to maintain 2024 guidance, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on USFD to 82 from 76. This represents 15% upside compared to current trading levels.


The firm sees "reason for cautious optimism" on the prospects for the restaurant sector in 2025 and models modestly better U.S. industry growth this year of almost 5%, compared to just over 4% last year. However, the firm doesn't see underlying fundamental themes shifting quickly after a "sluggish" 2024.


Truist also hiked its price target to 78 from 74 and kept a buy rating on the shares, marking 9% upside.


Analyst consensus currently pegs 2024 earnings coming in at $3.12 per share with revenue totaling $37.87 billion, according to FactSet.


Looking further out, analysts project USFD earnings ballooning more than 100%, compared to 2023 levels, by 2028.

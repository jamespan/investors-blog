**GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the S&P 500 component rebounded off a key level, offering investors a buy opportunity.  
**GE Vernova** （[GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)） 是周四的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为标准普尔 500 指数成分股从关键水平反弹，为投资者提供了买入机会。


Last week, GEV stock received several price target hikes after GE Vernova, announced a $1 annual dividend and a $6 billion share buyback program at its Dec. 10 investor day event. It's part of its strategy to return at least a third of free cash flow to shareholders.  
上周，在 GE Vernova 在 12 月 10 日的投资者日活动中宣布 1 美元的年度股息和 60 亿美元的股票回购计划后，GEV 股票的目标价多次上调。将至少三分之一的自由现金流返还给股东是其战略的一部分。


The company also revised 2025 revenue guidance, expecting $36 billion to $37 billion, narrowed from its previous $35 billion to $37 billion range. GEV also forecasts high-single digit revenue growth in 2028, up from its previous mid-single digit growth projections.  
该公司还修改了 2025 年收入指引，预计为 360 亿美元至 370 亿美元，从之前的 350 亿美元至 370 亿美元范围缩小。GEV 还预测 2028 年的收入将出现高个位数增长，高于之前的中个位数增长预测。




Free cash projections for 2025 are now $2 billion to $2.5 billion compared to GE Vernova's earlier $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion view.  
对 2025 年的自由现金预测现在为 20 亿至 25 亿美元，而 GE Vernova 此前的观点为 12 亿至 18 亿美元。


'Top Pick' Designation  “首选”称号
------------------------------


Following the investor day, Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith raised the firm's price target on GE Vernova to 391 from 348, maintaining a buy rating. Wells Fargo also raised its price target on GEV to 411 from 385.  
投资者日之后，Jefferies 分析师 Julien Dumoulin-Smith 将该公司对 GE Vernova 的目标价从 348 上调至 391，维持买入评级。富国银行还将 GEV 的目标价从 385 上调至 411。


William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer last week even proclaimed that GE Vernova was a "top pick" for 2025, with natural gas set to play an important role as technology companies pour resources into artificial intelligence and the data centers needed to train the programs.  
William Blair 分析师 Jed Dorsheimer 上周甚至宣称，GE Vernova 是 2025 年的“首选”，随着科技公司将资源投入人工智能和训练项目所需的数据中心，天然气将发挥重要作用。


The analyst believes natural gas will be the "workhorse for near- and medium-term electricity load growth for the AI data-center build out" in 2025. Dorsheimer added that GE Vernova, which produces the turbines to drive natural gas-fired generators, is the "largest beneficiary of shift back to natural gas."  
该分析师认为，到 2025 年，天然气将成为“AI 数据中心建设中近期和中期电力负荷增长的主力军”。Dorsheimer 补充说，生产驱动天然气发电机的涡轮机的 GE Vernova 是“回归天然气的最大受益者”。

GE Vernova emerged from General Electric's big, long-term breakup earlier this year, with spinouts of **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) and **GE HealthCare Technologies** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)). GE Aerospace kept the GE ticker symbol.

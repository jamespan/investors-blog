**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the e-commerce software and services providerstarts off2025 strongly. The Canada-based company has several initiatives underway that could provide upside for Shopify stock.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Shopify stock rose 4.6% to close at 114.24. Shares are up about 6% in 2025. In 2024, Shopify stock gained 36%. Shares hit a high of 120.72 on Dec. 6, then retreated a bit.


Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses, and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping.


 The December quarter is usually Shopify's best quarter annually because of the holiday shopping period.


Q4 Best Quarter Seasonally
--------------------------


"It's very logical that, given our scale, you're going to see (Q4) as most likely the strongest free cash flow margins in any given quarter," said Shopify Chief Financial Officer Jeff Hoffmeister at a recent UBS financial conference. "We saw that last year as well in terms of how that played out."


In December, Shopify preannounced e-commerce data following the Thanksgiving holiday.


"Shopify's Black Friday Cyber Monday sales of $11.5 billion (up 24% year-over-year) signals that the company can achieve, and is likely to exceed consensus Q4 gross merchandise volume growth expectations of +23.5% ($92.8 billion)," said Deutsche Bank analyst Bhavin Shah in a report.


Shopify Stock: Enterprise Market
--------------------------------


While Shopify's roots are in catering to small- and medium-size businesses, it has expanded into the "enterprise" market targeting large companies.


In the enterprise market, competitors include **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), and **BigCommerce** ([BIGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIGC)).


Shopify's e-commerce software and services were designed for companies selling products to consumers. But Shopify has expanded into business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce.


In addition, Shopify's e-commerce business has focused on online shoppers. But the company has pushed into "point-of-sale" services in physical retail stores, especially for large merchants.


"We have a lot of excellent merchants that are working with us online that we see an opportunity to work with them offline," Hoffmeister said. "And, of course, the natural starting point for us is the ones that have multiple locations — 10, 20, 30 locations."


Lastly, some of Shopify's growth is coming from expansion into Europe.

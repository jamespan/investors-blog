**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Friday.

Q3 Reassures On Metric 'Everyone Worried About'Q3 对 Metric 的保证是“每个人都担心”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Amazon beat expectations with earnings of $1.43 per share and sales of $158.9 billion, as [reported late Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-q3-2024-earnings-report-amzn-aws-ai/). But it wasn't necessarily a perfect report. The tech giant's revenue forecast for its holiday quarter was slightly lower than expected, while third quarter sales for its closely-watched Amazon Web Services cloud division also came in slightly lower than anticipated.  
周四[晚些时候报道](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-q3-2024-earnings-report-amzn-aws-ai/)称，亚马逊每股收益为 1.43 美元，销售额为 1589 亿美元，超出预期。但这不一定是一份完美的报告。这家科技巨头对其假日季度的收入预测略低于预期，而其备受关注的亚马逊网络服务云部门第三季度的销售额也略低于预期。


The positive reaction comes because Amazon operating income came in strong, analysts said.  
分析师表示，积极的反应是因为亚马逊的营业收入强劲。


Operating income was the "main metric everyone was worried about," Stifel analyst Mark Kelley said in a client note. Analysts had been debating how long Amazon could continue the steady profitability boost seen under [Chief Executive Andy Jassy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-andy-jassy-ceo-jeff-bezos/). The company is spending billions on chips and new data centers to power its AI ambitions. It is also ramping up spending on its [Project Kuiper satellite internet initiative](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-downgrade-aws-ecommerce-wells-fargo/).  
营业收入是“每个人都担心的主要指标”，Stifel 分析师 Mark Kelley 在一份客户报告中表示。分析师一直在争论亚马逊能在[首席执行官安迪·贾西 （Andy Jassy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-andy-jassy-ceo-jeff-bezos/)） 的领导下保持稳定的盈利能力增长多久。该公司正在芯片和新数据中心上花费数十亿美元，以支持其人工智能雄心。它还在增加其 [Kuiper 卫星互联网计划的](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-downgrade-aws-ecommerce-wells-fargo/)支出。


But Amazon's Q3 operating income of $17.4 billion cruised past Wall Street estimates of $14.7 billion, according to FactSet.  


"Amazon delivered a very solid 3Q with GAAP operating income dollars outperforming by a wide, roughly 18% margin vs. the Street," Kelley wrote. "Operating margins improved across all three reporting segments, which was the main concern most investors had heading into the print, mostly due to expectations for Kuiper costs to work their way into the P&L (profit and loss statement) in a fairly meaningful way."  


Further, Amazon guided for operating income of $18 billion for the fourth quarter, ahead of the $17.3 billion analysts were looking for, according to FactSet consensus.  


"Investors were delighted to see Amazon oozing green this Halloween as overall earnings before interest and taxes margin hit a new record 11.0%, driven by new records at AWS (38.1%) and International (3.6%)," Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote late Thursday.  


Amazon Stock: Jassy Touts Retail Efficiency
-------------------------------------------


On a call with analysts Thursday, Jassy said the tech giant remains focused on lowering "cost to serve," or the money it spends getting products to customers. That includes effort to streamline its fulfillment network and integrate automation into its operations.  


"At a time when consumers are being careful about how much they spend, we're continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly, and we can see this resonating with customers, as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth," Jassy told analysts.

AI A 'Once In Lifetime' Opportunity
-----------------------------------


Even with AWS sales growth coming in slightly lower than expected, Jassy said the business is seeing strong demand powered by generative AI. Jassy said AI is a "multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit" rate for AWS.  


The company is spending big on AI-capable data centers and other costs to meet demand. Amazon expects $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, up from about $50 billion in 2023. Jassy says he expects capex to increase further next year, mostly to support AWS.  
该公司正在为支持 AI 的数据中心和其他成本投入巨资，以满足需求。亚马逊预计今年的资本支出为 750 亿美元，高于 2023 年的约 500 亿美元。Jassy 表示，他预计明年的资本支出将进一步增加，主要是为了支持 AWS。


"I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business," Jassy told analysts. "And we expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI. It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity."  
“我认为我们已经随着时间的推移证明，我们可以推动足够的营业收入和自由现金流，使其成为一项非常成功的投资资本回报业务，”Jassy 告诉分析师。“我们预计生成式 AI 也会发生同样的事情。这是一个非常不同寻常的机会，也许是千载难逢的机会。


Analysts appeared to support that view.  
分析师似乎支持这一观点。


"Amazon's capex investment to build its next-gen growth drivers is coming ($75 billion of estimated FY24 capex was 12%, or $8 billion, higher than expected), but we think investors should be willing to digest this investment given the current growth and long-term opportunity for AWS," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak Friday.  
摩根士丹利分析师 Brian Nowak 周五写道：“亚马逊为打造其下一代增长动力而进行的资本支出投资即将到来（估计 24 财年资本支出为 750 亿美元，比预期高出 12%，即 80 亿美元），但我们认为，鉴于 AWS 目前的增长和长期机会，投资者应该愿意消化这笔投资。


Amazon Stock Approaching Breakout亚马逊股票接近突破

Manhattan Associates Stock Bouncing Back
----------------------------------------


Manhattan Associates, meanwhile, is still working back to highs reached in mid-October. The stock tumbled 7% the day after the company reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 22.  


Adjusted earnings per share increased 29% year-over-year for the September-ended quarter, while sales rose 12% to $266.7 million. Both top- and bottom-line metrics exceeded consensus expectations, but analysts noted the company's guidance prompted some investor concern.  


"We believe guidance is conservative, (the company's) beat and raise dynamics intact and are incrementally confident in sustained strong cloud, earnings and free-cash-flow compounding growth," wrote Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman in an Oct. 22 client note. "Based on the lower revenue outlook for fiscal year 2025 and after-hours action, we expect shares to trade off tomorrow and would recommend buying on weakness."  
Truist Securities 分析师 Terry Tillman 在 10 月 22 日的客户报告中写道：“我们认为指引是保守的，（公司）的跑动和提高动态保持不变，并且对持续强劲的云、收益和自由现金流复合增长充满信心。“基于 2025 财年较低的收入前景和盘后行动，我们预计股市明天将进行交易，并建议在疲软时买入。”


Tillman rates the stock a buy.  
蒂尔曼将该股评为买入。


Manhattan Associates' adjusted earnings are projected to grow 23% this year while sales grow 12%, according to FactSet analyst consensus totals. Earnings grew 35% and sales jumped 21% in 2023.  
根据 FactSet 分析师的共识总数，Manhattan Associates（曼哈特公司）今年的调整后收益预计将增长 23%，销售额将增长 12%。2023 年，收益增长了 35%，销售额增长了 21%。


That's a factor to watch for Manhattan Associates. Revenue growth is projected by analysts to slow against tougher comparisons. Analysts project sales of $253.6 million for the company's December-ending fourth quarter. That would represent 6% year-over-year sales growth, after sales rose 12%, 14.8%, 15.2% and 20% in the previous four quarters.  
这是 Manhattan Associates（曼哈特公司）需要关注的一个因素。分析师预计，与更严格的比较相比，收入增长将放缓。分析师预计该公司截至 12 月的第四季度销售额为 2.536 亿美元。这将意味着销售额同比增长 6%，而前四个季度的销售额分别增长了 12%、14.8%、15.2% 和 20%。

However, growth remains strong for the cloud subscription business that investors tend to focus on. Cloud subscription revenue is seen rising 25% to $89.5 million in the company's Q4, according to FactSet.  
然而，投资者往往关注的云订阅业务的增长仍然强劲。根据 FactSet 的数据，该公司第四季度的云订阅收入预计将增长 25%，达到 8950 万美元。


Piper Sandler analyst Quinton Gabrielli initiated coverage of Manhattan Associates with a positive overweight rating last month. He noted that the company is roughly seven years into a shift to the cloud, a process that can occasionally be bumpy for software companies.  
Piper Sandler 分析师 Quinton Gabrielli 上个月开始对 Manhattan Associates（曼哈顿公司）进行正面增持评级。他指出，该公司向云的转变已经有大约 7 年的时间了，对于软件公司来说，这个过程有时可能会很坎坷。


"The supply chain space is seeing multiple secular tailwinds accelerating market growth, and Manhattan's expertise in the most complex environments is differentiating," Gabrielli wrote to clients on Nov. 24. "While cloud transitions can be messy, Manhattan is through the 'worst' of the revenue headwinds, creating increased visibility and margin improvement moving forward, while still offering a more than $3 billion migration opportunity."  
“供应链领域正在看到多种长期利好因素加速市场增长，而曼哈特在最复杂环境中的专业知识正在脱颖而出，”Gabrielli 在 11 月 24 日写给客户的信中说。“虽然云过渡可能很混乱，但曼哈顿正在经历'最糟糕'的收入逆风，提高了知名度和利润率，同时仍然提供了超过 30 亿美元的迁移机会。”


He set a price target of 326 for Manhattan Associates stock with the report.

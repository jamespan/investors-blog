**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the subscription streaming video leader hovers in the buy zone of its post-earnings breakout.


On Jan. 22, Netflix stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 941.75, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. It spiked to a record high of 999 before pulling back into the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/) of its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). That buy zone extends to 988.84, based on [IBD trading principles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-rules-for-when-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-bull-and-bear-markets/).




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Netflix stock gained a fraction to close at 978.94. Stocks responded negatively to President Trump's new tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.


Netflix's breakout occurred after the internet television network crushed Wall Street's targets for new subscribers in the [fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-breakout-q4-2024-results-outlook/). It also topped revenue and earnings estimates for the December quarter and guided slightly above views for sales in the March quarter.


Analysts polled by FactSet now expect Netflix to earn $5.75 a share on sales of $10.5 billion in the first quarter. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 9% in earnings and 12% in revenue.

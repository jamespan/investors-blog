**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the AI-chip maker rises above its 50-day moving average line, offering an early entry.  


Nvidia shares have risen for four consecutive trading days, rebounding from a recent sell-off. Earlier this month, Nvidia stock triggered [sell signals](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-sell-zone-power-chip-overheating-issue/).  




Nvidia's climb above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) is a positive sign. But shares have been moving sideways for two months amid concerns about demand and production issues with its latest Blackwell graphics processing units.  


Still, Nvidia stock is on track to form a shallow [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) by the end of the week. That base would have a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 146.54.  


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Nvidia stock advanced 0.4% to close at 140.22. Earlier in the session, it was up as much as 1.6% to 141.90. Shares are actionable above the 50-day line as well as clearing a short downward-sloping trendline from the record high of 152.89.  


Nvidia's upsurge follows the rise of its contract chipmaker **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). On Monday, TSM stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at a buy point of 205.63.  



Nvidia Stock Catalysts Ahead
----------------------------


The next potential catalyst for Nvidia stock could be announcements at the CES 2025 tech trade show in Las Vegas. Chief Executive Jensen Huang is scheduled to give a keynote speech there on Jan. 6.  


Then in March, Nvidia is holding its GTC conference. That AI-focused conference is set for March 17-21 in San Jose, Calif.  


Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said Nvidia is likely to introduce its GB300 AI server, known as "Blackwell Ultra," at GTC. He rates Nvidia stock as outperform with a price target of 175.  


On Friday, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore called Nvidia stock a [top pick for 2025](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-ai-chip-stocks-morgan-stanley-report/).  


Nvidia stock is on four IBD stock lists: [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) and [Tech Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-tech-leaders-dec-23-2024/).

**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the world's leading chip foundry benefits from producing artificial intelligence chips for all the major players. TSM stock jumped Friday after customer **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) raised expectations for its AI chip sales.  
**Taiwan Aged Manufacturing** （[TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)） 是[当今的 IBD 股票](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为世界领先的芯片代工厂受益于为所有主要参与者生产人工智能芯片。在客户**博通** （[AVGO）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO) 上调对其 AI 芯片销售的预期后，TSM 股价周五上涨。


Taiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, is the top producer of advanced computer chips made at the smallest circuit nodes. Its customers include AI-chip makers Broadcom, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)).

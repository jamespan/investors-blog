Analysts See Fortinet Benefiting From 'Vendor Consolidation'分析师认为 Fortinet 将从“供应商整合”中受益
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Analysts project Fortinet's 2024 adjusted earnings will increase 38% to $2.25 per share while sales climb 11% to $5.9 billion. That's a slowdown from the 20% sales growth Fortinet posted in 2023 and 32% growth in 2022. The company's product revenue has slowed as companies have pulled back on network firewall spending.  
分析师预计 Fortinet 2024 年调整后收益将增长 38% 至每股 2.25 美元，而销售额将攀升 11% 至 59 亿美元。这比 Fortinet 在 2023 年公布的 20% 和 2022 年的 32% 的销售增长有所放缓。随着公司缩减网络防火墙支出，该公司的产品收入放缓。


Competition is [also increasing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-stocks/) as companies look to provide a broader cybersecurity platform across several services.  
随着公司希望为多种服务提供更广泛的网络安全平台，竞争[也日益激烈](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-stocks/)。


But Fortinet stock jumped 10% on Nov. 8 following a [third-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-fortinet-earnings-q32024-revenue-billings-top-estimates/) that beat expectations for both earnings and sales. Later in November, Fortinet [hosted an analyst presentation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-investor-day-firewall-market/) that led to a mostly positive reception from Wall Street.  
但 Fortinet 股价在 11 月 8 日上涨 10%，此前第三[季度收益报告](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-fortinet-earnings-q32024-revenue-billings-top-estimates/)和销售额均超出预期。11 月下旬，Fortinet [举办了一场分析师演讲](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-investor-day-firewall-market/)，华尔街对此大多表示好评。


"Even though there were no new product announcements, we came away incrementally more positive from the conference as it is one of the best positioned security companies to benefit from vendor consolidation based on its product breadth, in our opinion," Truist analyst Junaid Siddiqui said in a note to clients following the Nov. 18 presentation. "We continue to be impressed with the company's pace of innovation and favor its balanced approach between growth and profitability."  
Truist 分析师 Junaid Siddiqui 在 11 月 18 日演讲后给客户的一份报告中表示：“尽管没有发布新产品，但我们从会议中逐渐变得更加积极，因为我们认为，根据其产品广度，它是最有可能从供应商整合中受益的安全公司之一。“我们继续对公司的创新速度印象深刻，并赞成其在增长和盈利能力之间的平衡方法。”


Truist reiterated a buy rating for Fortinet stock with its report. Analysts at BofA Securities also rate Fortinet stock a buy and were positive overall on the analyst presentation last month.  
Truist 在其报告中重申了对 Fortinet 股票的买入评级。美银证券的分析师也将 Fortinet 股票评为买入，并在上个月的分析师报告中总体持积极态度。


"On the one hand, management did not provide guidance for 2025, driving some uncertainty about the magnitude of the upcoming firewall refresh cycle," BofA analyst Tal Liani said in a Nov. 19 note. "On the other hand, (Fortinet's) three- to five-year guidance targets are solid, and we see room for upside vs. (Wall) Street estimates for 6.6% product revenue growth in 2025."  
“一方面，管理层没有为 2025 年提供指导，这为即将到来的防火墙更新周期的幅度带来了一些不确定性，”美国银行分析师 Tal Liani 在 11 月 19 日的一份报告中表示。“另一方面，（Fortinet）的三到五年指导目标是可靠的，与（华尔）华尔街估计的 2025 年产品收入增长 6.6% 相比，我们看到了上行空间。”


Analysts are mostly neutral on the stock overall, however. There are 42 analysts following Fortinet, according to FactSet, with 16 holding a buy or equivalent rating. Meanwhile, 25 analysts are neutral and one analyst holds a sell call.  
然而，分析师对该股的整体看法大多是中性的。根据 FactSet 的数据，有 42 位分析师关注 Fortinet，其中 16 位持有买入或同等评级。同时，25 位分析师持中立态度，1 位分析师持有卖出看涨期权。


Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, for example, wrote following the analyst day that Fortinet is a "strong technology company" but he "cannot ignore the fact that business momentum has deteriorated in each of the last eight quarters." He kept to a neutral call.  
例如，古根海姆分析师 John DiFucci 在分析师日之后写道，Fortinet 是一家“强大的科技公司”，但他“不能忽视过去八个季度中每个季度的业务势头都在恶化的事实”。他保持中立。

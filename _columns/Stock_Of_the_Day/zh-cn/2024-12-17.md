**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday. Shares of the cybersecurity company are in a short [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) that could become a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) by next week.  


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Fortinet stock dipped a fraction to close at 97.62. Shares of the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company have rallied 67% this year, including a 16% gain since the company reported third-quarter earnings in early November. Fortinet is the top-ranked stock among the 85-stock Computer Software-Security group tracked by Investor's Business Daily.  




Founded in 2000, Fortinet competes against **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and other firms in the firewall network security market, designed to block against online intrusions and other cyber threats. Fortinet also targets a growing market called Secure Access Service Edge. SASE rolls up a range of cybersecurity functions for enterprises to a single cloud-based package.  


Analysts See Fortinet Benefiting From 'Vendor Consolidation'
------------------------------------------------------------


Analysts project Fortinet's 2024 adjusted earnings will increase 38% to $2.25 per share while sales climb 11% to $5.9 billion. That's a slowdown from the 20% sales growth Fortinet posted in 2023 and 32% growth in 2022. The company's product revenue has slowed as companies have pulled back on network firewall spending.  


Competition is [also increasing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-stocks/) as companies look to provide a broader cybersecurity platform across several services.  


But Fortinet stock jumped 10% on Nov. 8 following a [third-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-fortinet-earnings-q32024-revenue-billings-top-estimates/) that beat expectations for both earnings and sales. Later in November, Fortinet [hosted an analyst presentation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fortinet-stock-investor-day-firewall-market/) that led to a mostly positive reception from Wall Street.  


"Even though there were no new product announcements, we came away incrementally more positive from the conference as it is one of the best positioned security companies to benefit from vendor consolidation based on its product breadth, in our opinion," Truist analyst Junaid Siddiqui said in a note to clients following the Nov. 18 presentation. "We continue to be impressed with the company's pace of innovation and favor its balanced approach between growth and profitability."  


Truist reiterated a buy rating for Fortinet stock with its report. Analysts at BofA Securities also rate Fortinet stock a buy and were positive overall on the analyst presentation last month.  


"On the one hand, management did not provide guidance for 2025, driving some uncertainty about the magnitude of the upcoming firewall refresh cycle," BofA analyst Tal Liani said in a Nov. 19 note. "On the other hand, (Fortinet's) three- to five-year guidance targets are solid, and we see room for upside vs. (Wall) Street estimates for 6.6% product revenue growth in 2025."  


Analysts are mostly neutral on the stock overall, however. There are 42 analysts following Fortinet, according to FactSet, with 16 holding a buy or equivalent rating. Meanwhile, 25 analysts are neutral and one analyst holds a sell call.  


Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, for example, wrote following the analyst day that Fortinet is a "strong technology company" but he "cannot ignore the fact that business momentum has deteriorated in each of the last eight quarters." He kept to a neutral call.

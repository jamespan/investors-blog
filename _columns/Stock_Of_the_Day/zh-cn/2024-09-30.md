**M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the homebuilder traded near a buy point in the midst of a nearly 50% advance from recent lows. MHO shares angled up Monday.  
**M/I Homes** （[MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)） 是周一的 [IBD 今日股票](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)，因为这家住宅建筑商在从近期低点上涨近 50% 的情况下，在买入点附近交易。MHO 股价周一小幅上涨。


Ohio-based M/I Homes is one the top U.S. homebuilders. with operations across the Midwest, Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Tennessee.  
总部位于俄亥俄州的 M/I Homes 是美国顶级住宅建筑商之一。业务遍及中西部、佛罗里达州、德克萨斯州、北卡罗来纳州和田纳西州。




M/I Homes reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue at the end of July. Analysts forecast Q3 EPS growing 2.5% with sales increasing around 8%. The company is expected to report third-quarter financials in late October.  
M/I Homes 在 7 月底报告称，第二季度收益和收入好于预期。分析师预测第三季度每股收益增长 2.5%，销售额增长约 8%。该公司预计将于 10 月下旬报告第三季度财务数据。


For the full year, analyst consensus has earnings jumping 22% to $19.76 per share. Profit is expected to hit $22.99 per share in 2026, which would represent a 41% increase compared to 2023 levels.  
对于全年，分析师普遍认为收益增长 22% 至每股 19.76 美元。预计 2026 年利润将达到每股 22.99 美元，与 2023 年的水平相比增长 41%。


In late August, Seaport Research initiated coverage of M/I Homes with a neutral rating and no price target. The analyst wrote that the builder has grown from its Midwest roots into Texas, Florida and the Carolinas. Those new areas now account for around 60% of its sales. The firm believes MHO's current margin success could raise cyclical concerns.  
8 月下旬，Seaport Research 开始对 M/I Homes 进行报道，评级为中性，无目标价。这位分析师写道，这家建筑商已经从中西部的根源发展到德克萨斯州、佛罗里达州和卡罗来纳州。这些新区域现在占其销售额的 60% 左右。该公司认为，MHO 目前的利润率成功可能会引发周期性担忧。

The Fed Rate Cut And Housing美联储降息和住房
------------------------------------


The [Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/next-federal-reserve-meeting-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/) recently cut rates for the first time since the Covid crisis with Fed Chief Jerome Powell signaling more easing along with an economic soft landing.  
[美联储](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/next-federal-reserve-meeting-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/)最近自 Covid 危机以来首次降息，美联储主席杰罗姆鲍威尔暗示将进一步宽松政策以及经济软着陆。


For 2025, policymakers see another 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts, bringing the key rate down to a 3.25%-3.5% range.  
对于 2025 年，政策制定者预计美联储将再次降息 100 个基点，使关键利率降至 3.25%-3.5% 的区间。


Homebuilders for more than a year have said that housing affordability has been tested by interest rate movements. Many homebuilders have turned to incentives to keep home prices down and drum up demand amid increased interest rates. However, mortgage rates have fallen considerably over the past few months along with Treasury yields in anticipation of Fed rate cuts. That boosts affordability, so potential buyers may need fewer incentives to seal the deal, leading to higher profits for M/I Homes and others.  
一年多来，房屋建筑商一直表示，住房负担能力已经受到利率变动的考验。许多房屋建筑商已转向激励措施，以压低房价并在利率上升的情况下刺激需求。然而，由于预期美联储降息，抵押贷款利率在过去几个月与美国国债收益率一起大幅下降。这提高了负担能力，因此潜在买家可能需要更少的激励措施来达成交易，从而为 M/I Homes 和其他公司带来更高的利润。

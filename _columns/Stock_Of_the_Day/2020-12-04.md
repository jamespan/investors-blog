**Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after shares broke out and touched a record high. Investor enthusiasm is frothing NVCR stock with several important studies due in 2021.




The company sees itself at the intersection of [biotechnology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) and [medical technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/). It makes a cancer treatment device called Optune that uses electric fields at specific frequencies to interrupt cell division. By doing so, Novocure hopes to stop cancer in its tracks.


And Novocure isn't stopping at glioblastoma or mesothelioma — cancers of the brain and lungs, respectively — where it has Food and Drug Administration approval. The company hopes to open up its technology to more common types of cancer.


That's where 2021 will be important for NVCR stock, JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a report. Novocure is expected to unveil the results of Optune studies in cancers of the liver, lungs, stomach and ovaries.

"Current levels appear to be pricing in both a high probability of successful Phase 3 readouts and a significant uptake in future sales and, as such, we need greater conviction on additional upside drivers and/or material acceleration in U.S. prescription trends before we get more constructive," he said. Kasimov retained his neutral rating on NVCR stock.


NVCR Stock Pops
---------------


On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-market-today/), NVCR stock popped 9.2% to close at 147.50. It wasn't clear immediately what was driving the surge.


"Unfortunately, as a matter of company policy, we don't comment on daily price movements; however, we are pleased by the ongoing recognition by the street of the value of our company as we strive to extend survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer," company spokeswoman Jaclyn Stahl said in an email to Investor's Business Daily.


But it put Novocure stock at a record high. Shares easily cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 140.99 out of a consolidation, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Some investors might have bought at a 137.56 buy point out of a handle in the pattern. But it was a deeper than normal handle.


Notably, the stock's [relative strength line](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/#:~:text=A%20stock's%20Relative%20Strength%20line,scores%20a%20new%20price%20high.) is rebounding and is near highs.


In early November, NVCR stock broke a downtrend as it rebounded from its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Shares later sold off heavily, but found support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). And, on the weekly chart, that sell-off actually turned out to be a support week.


According to J.P. Morgan's Kasimov, things could continue to improve for NVCR stock in 2021.


Why This Is A 2021 Story
------------------------


Novocure's Optune is currently approved to treat newly diagnosed and recurrent forms of glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, and mesothelioma, a lung cancer. But there are much bigger opportunities in cancer treatment.


"Label expansion is the next leg of the Novocure stock and, to that end, the company highlighted several meaningful catalysts approaching in 2021," Kasimov said following a meeting with the company. The value of Optune's technology "is driven by the ability to improve on top of standard therapy with little-to-no incremental safety concern."


Optune works through patches attached to the body. So, a lung cancer patient would wear patches on the back and chest. A brain cancer patient wears a patch on the head. Those patches, attached with sticky adhesive, transmit what Novocure calls "tumor-treating fields."



Tumor-treating fields therapy works with other standard cancer drugs because it doesn't have any side effects other than a feeling of warmth on the skin, the company says. But Kasimov says the company still needs to engage in patient and physician education.


Strong Earnings, Sales Growth
-----------------------------


The recent third quarter was a bright spot for NVCR stock. The company put up 350% growth in adjusted earnings to 9 cents per share. Sales popped 44% to $132.7 million.


In the fourth quarter, analysts polled by FactSet expect Novocure to earn 8 cents a share, doubling year over year. Sales would rise by a third to $131.8 million.


All of this is reflected in the strong ratings behind NVCR stock. Shares have a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 93 out of a best-possible 99. The CR tracks a stock's fundamental and technical metrics. So, this puts NVCR stock in the top 7% of all stocks in terms of those measures.


Notably, NVCR stock is a member of Investor's Business Daily's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).

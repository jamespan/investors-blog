**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the auto parts retailer eyes a new buy point amid a shift away from sales of new cars caused by the coronavirus pandemic. O'Reilly stock reversed lower Tuesday.




Auto parts retailers including O'Reilly are benefiting from the rising number of miles driven in the U.S. and increasing age of vehicles on the road.


Amid fears of a global economic slowdown and a lingering pandemic, consumers are likely to fix up their existing cars rather than buy new cars. That may also help to explain why O'Reilly stock has won favor of late, living up to the reputation that auto parts retailers offer a defensive safe haven in tough markets.


And shares are likelier to hold up better than most stocks if the market really tumbles in the year ahead.


The retailer of aftermarket car supplies and tools serves both the individual or do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional or commercial or do-it-for-me (DIFM) customer. Analysts say O'Reilly's dual-market approach is the best developed among national auto parts retailers.

Shares gapped up more than 5% July 30 after second-quarter results smashed expectations. Earnings jumped 57% to $7.10 a share vs. estimates for $4.10 as sales rose 19% to $3.09 billion.


Despite severe coronavirus pandemic challenges in the first two weeks of Q2, O'Reilly said it saw "an immediate and dramatic improvement in our business and sustained robust, record-setting sales volumes" throughout the rest of the quarter.


In Q2, O'Reilly's DIY business was "extremely strong" and drove a 16.2% increase in same-store sales. However, the DIFM business "improved significantly" as the quarter progressed.


Government stimulus and unemployment benefits drove demand, as well as the lifting of stay-at-home orders, O'Reilly said. The company itself doubled down on controlling costs, which helped to improve operating profit margins to 23.8%.


O'Reilly has an EPS Rating of 95 out of 99 and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-. The retailer grew earnings per share 23% on average over the past three quarters, above the 21% average of the last three years. Sales grew 6% over the last three years.


Looking forward, analysts expect earnings for all of fiscal 2020 to grow 15.8% to $20.71, and increase a further 4.9% in 2021, according to Zacks Investment Research. Sales are likely to rise 8% in 2020 and 3.5% in 2021.

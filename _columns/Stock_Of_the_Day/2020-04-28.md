S&P Global Earnings
-------------------


S&P Global earnings per share popped 29% to $2.73. This was comfortably clear of analyst views for $2.36 per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. The firm has bested Wall Street expectations in each of the last four quarters.


Revenue jumped 14% to $1.79 billion, which also was better than expected and marked the fifth straight quarter of acceleration. S&P Global have topped consensus revenue estimates in each of the past four quarters.


In terms of outlook, the firm has outlined three scenarios. A late Q3 recovery is currently the baseline, which would put full-year EPS at $9.95-$10.15, about in line with consensus for $9.91. An early Q3 recovery scenario puts EPS at $10.10-$10.30, while a late Q4 recovery would put it at $9.80-$10.


"Substantially all of our operations have continued uninterrupted and we have increased the magnitude of our research and the scope of our customer outreach," CEO Douglas Peterson said in an earnings statement.

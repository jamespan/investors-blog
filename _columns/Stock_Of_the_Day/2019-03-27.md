**Yeti Holdings** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)), which designs and markets premium coolers and other outdoor gear, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares vaulted to a new high early Wednesday but pared gains in a sharp reversal, before heading back up to close near the top of the day's range.




Still, after a 62% rally from a mid-February [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) to its session high, the stock could be getting ready to take a breather. It may be a good time to lock in some profits. Volume was tracking much higher than usual in early afternoon trading, and heavy turnover could signal that institutional investors are selling into strength.


Many leading stocks pause to digest gains after a [20% to 25% run-up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) following a breakout. Keep in mind too, Yeti has gained as much as 84% from its Oct. 25 offering price of 18 a share.


On Feb. 14, Yeti Holdings soared 17% after its Q4 results. The Austin, Texas-based company earned 38 cents a share on $241.2 million in sales; analysts expected 33 cents on $237 million in revenue. It also guided for full-year EPS between 99 cents and $1.04, above Street forecasts for 95 cents.

That helped propel the stock past a 19.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of an 11-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base in tremendous volume, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) analysis. And it hasn't really looked back since. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at new highs, a bullish sign.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) assigns Yeti an 86 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). That puts it among the leaders in the 19-stock leisure products industry group. The cooler maker's 98 [Earnings Per Share](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) and 99 [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) ratings are best in the group. An A Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to more net buying than selling by mutual funds.


Yeti Scores Price Target Hike
-----------------------------


Analysts also expect further growth from Yeti. Jefferies last week raised its price target to 40 from 35 and maintained a buy rating, citing an "expanding" brand reach and growing shelf space at **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), among other reasons.


So, Yeti Holdings looks solid all around. Yet, the sharp downward reversal during the session — combined with uncertain market direction — make a compelling argument to take some profits for now.



Remember **Canada Goose Holdings** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS))?


The March 2017 IPO, displayed similar action and it also is a company with premium-priced products. The stock rallied as much as 437% from its initial offering price to a June 20 high. But it reversed sharply lower that day and fell the next two sessions. That week, shares sank nearly 6% in the heaviest volume since its IPO week.


The stock made another push higher after several months of choppy action, but quickly turned south again. It's still 34% below the June 20 high.


The lesson? Lock in some profits when red flags appear. That doesn't mean investors should stop watching stocks like Yeti. It could set up another buy opportunity, once it goes through a proper cooling off period.

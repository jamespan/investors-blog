DECK stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Ugg and Hoka brand owner rises off support at a key technical level, backed by a strong relative strength line.




Goleta, Calif.-based **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) is poised to keep growing earnings and revenue, but at a lower double-digit pace.


Its celeb-favorite Hoka One sneaker brand continues to pound out growth, recently achieving a $1 billion revenue milestone. Fans of the well-cushioned Hoka sneaker brand include Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon, as well as runners and nurses.


More importantly, footwear tends to be recession resistant. People buy shoes in good times and bad. However, Deckers faces headwinds from lingering supply disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It also faces labor shortages; along with the rapid rise in inflation and geopolitical tensions, which are weighing on discretionary spending by consumers.

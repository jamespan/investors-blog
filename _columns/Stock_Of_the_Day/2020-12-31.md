**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the social media firm pulls back to its 10-week line. A rebound from that key level would offer a buying opportunity in Pinterest stock.




Shares popped nearly 27% on Pinterest's third-quarter earnings report, released on Oct. 28. The stock then consolidated for nearly two months. Pinterest stock has dropped four out of the past five trading sessions, pulling back to its 10-week line. Shares fell 1.9% to close at 65.90 Thursday.


Investors should look for a [rebound off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The rebound should be noticeable on a chart and depends on how steep the pullback is.


Also, with a 10-week line pullback/rebound, the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) can be imprecise.

Investors usually should buy within 10% of the 10-week line — closer is better — once a rebound has been identified.


Pinterest Stock: Lines Blurring Between Digital Ads, E-Commerce
---------------------------------------------------------------


Pinterest is a website where users post photos, charts and other images covering a wide range of categories and interests, with visual search capabilities.


It garners most revenue from online advertising but aims to be a bigger player in e-commerce. The social media firm has partnered with **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) to develop online shopping tools for its website.


Pinterest currently does not take a cut of the sales made through its site.


On the advertising side, Pinterest has a base of small and medium-size businesses and large retailers. Also, it aims to attract big brands that may be looking for alternatives to **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) YouTube.


"We see PINS in the early innings of executing against a broad set of opportunities along a few key industry themes including the offline to online shift in ad spending and the blurring of lines between digital advertising and e-commerce," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said in a recent note to clients.


Company Founded In 2010
-----------------------


The company was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, a former employee of Alphabet's Google unit, and former Facebook product designer Evan Sharp.


Pinterest has developed methods for image searches that leverage machine learning, computer vision and a recommendation engine to help users search, browse and organize images and videos.


The company's September-quarter earnings handily topped expectations, thus boosting Pinterest stock.


The social media firm reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents a share, up from 1-cent profit a year earlier. Revenue jumped 58% to $443 million. Wall Street expected earnings of 4 cents a share on revenue of $383.5 million.


Pinterest Stock: Users Up 37%
-----------------------------


As of Sept. 30, Pinterest had 442 million monthly active users, up 37% from the year-ago period. About three-quarters of users are outside the U.S., although the majority of its revenue is domestic.


Pinterest stock owns a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a possible 99.


In addition, Pinterest stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/).


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

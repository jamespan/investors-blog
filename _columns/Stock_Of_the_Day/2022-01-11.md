ZIM stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Alibaba shipping partner breaks out to highs. Rising freight volumes fueled huge profit growth and a raised 2021 outlook for the Israeli cargo shipping liner.




In addition to container freight shipping capacity,Â **Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) provides **Alibaba.com** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) with logistics technology, driving efficiencies into the Chinese e-commerce giant's international shipments.


Other fleet operators include **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)), **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) and **Textainer Group** ([TGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGH)). Shipping stocks have performed well during the coronavirus pandemic, continuing to trade at or near highs after big runs in 2021. Textainer Group stock, Star Bulk Carriers and [IBD 50 stock ZIM](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) each wields a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99.


ZIM Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------


Shares of Zim Integrated Shipping Services are breaking out in above-average volume from a consolidation with a 59.79 handle buy point. The stock had formed and broken out from a prior handle with a 58.41 buy point.


Both buy points are valid. For investors who purchased at the earlier breakout, the stock remains in a buy range through 61.33. The new handle carries slightly more risk because it is a slightly unorthodox high handle construct. This means the left-side high of the handle is above that of the attached consolidation. This buy range extends to 62.78.



In either case, on a MarketSmith chart, ZIM stock chalked up new highs on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). ZIM ended Tuesday's session with a 4.7% gain, at 61.44.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for ZIM stock also made a new high alongside the breakout, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). That is a bullish sign.


A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown.


In addition to Zim Integrated Shipping's 99 [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?nav=IBDUKeyTerms), it also has a top [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/renlative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 99. That means ZIM stock has outperformed 99% of all stocks over the past year.


Zim Integrated Shipping Services Earnings and Fundamentals
----------------------------------------------------------

That's especially impressive for a new IPO, many of which tend to struggle to turn a profit.

Citing record September-quarter results, Zim said it was "poised to return significant capital to shareholders in 2022," translating to 30%-50% of 2021 net income. Zim issued a $2 per share special dividend in September 2021 and a $2.50 per share interim dividend in December 2021.


At the same time, Zim raised its full-year 2021 guidance. That reflected "Zim's strong outlook and extremely positive container liner market fundamentals," CEO Eli Glickman said in a news release.


Analysts on average expect Zim earnings to grow 625% in all of 2021, then to plunge 37% in 2022. Revenue is seen growing 164% in 2021, before falling 10% in 2022.


The company pays a quarterly dividend of $2.50 per share, yielding 16.4%.


Last January, ZIM stock came public amid a container shipping boom. Shipping rates surged amid strong demand for electronics, furniture, bicycles and other goods, with consumers riding out the pandemic close to home.

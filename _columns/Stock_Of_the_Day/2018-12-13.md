**Addus Homecare** ([ADUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADUS)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the [home-care service provider](https://www.addus.com/) trades in a tight range after a breakout. That could provide investors with a chance to add shares in this top growth stock. In the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Addus stock dipped 0.8% to 75.07.



Addus Stock Technical Analyis
-----------------------------


Addus stock broke out of a consolidation in a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) on Nov. 7. While the stock quickly turned tail after that, it was able to find [support at the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-school-using-regenerons-five-year-rally-to-study-support/) and rebound higher.


The 72.65 buy point is still technically valid because Addus stock never fully triggered the [8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/). It came very close to that level when it fell as much as 7.9% intraday on Nov. 15. Now, Addus stock is back in the 5% buy zone and trading in a tight range.



Still, investors should not use the consolidation entry due to the [volatile stock market environment](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), which should make investors cautious about new buys. Instead, wait for today's Stock Of The Day to clear a newly formed three-weeks-tight entry.


Top Growth Stock Trades Tight
-----------------------------


When a stock closes in a tight range for three weeks in a row, we call this a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern. Seeing this action over the past several weeks is especially bullish given the heightened market volatility we've seen. The pattern is typically used for investors who want to add shares to an existing position, but that's if the stock is extended from a breakout.


The three-weeks-tight pattern for the IBD Stock Of The Day, with a 77.92 entry, can be used to start a new position as it is not extended beyond the 5% buy range from its last proper base. But investors should wait for a healthier market.


Investors should also keep in mind that Addus stock is not highly liquid, with an average daily volume of a little over 200,000 shares. Thinly traded stocks have the potential to be more volatile. It's best to stick to stocks that have a [dollar volume of at least $20 million](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/) to $25 million, and Addus falls short on that front.


IBD Stock Of The Day: Addus Homecare
------------------------------------


The Medical-Outpatient/Home Care industry group currently ranks No. 9 out of the 197 groups that IBD tracks. Top stocks typically come from the top quartile of IBD's groups. Addus Homecare earns a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning its shares outperform 99% of all stocks in the market as measured by key [fundamental and technical factors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/).


This top growth stock is expected to see earnings growth of 21% in 2018 and 23% in 2019. Strong [earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) is a key trait of top growth stocks.


Group peer **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) is showing similar chart action, though it fell over 8% after an attempted breakout. Still, [Amedisys stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/medical-sector-amedisys-stock-buy-point/) also earns a Composite Rating of 99 as it too has top-notch fundamentals in addition to relatively strong technical action. Amedisys stock fell 2.4% Thursday.

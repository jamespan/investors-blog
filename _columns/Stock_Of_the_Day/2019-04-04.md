**Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). After racking up big [stock market](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/what-is-the-stock-market-how-does-the-stock-market-work/) gains, Euronet stock has triggered a key profit-taking sell rule.




The former [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) operates a lucrative network of 41,902 ATMs, mostly located in Europe and India. Euronet Worldwide is also continuing to expand into other overseas markets.


However it looks like [it is time to withdraw at least partial profits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/), as the stock has been hitting resistance after propelling into the profit zone on the back of [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/euronet-earnings-q4-2018-hot-stock-euronet-stock-buy-point/).


Euronet Stock Technical Analysis
--------------------------------


Euronet stock blasted out from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 122.03 buy point on Feb. 8 following strong earnings. That's on a weekly chart, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). On a daily chart, Euronet stock cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) that day with a 117.08 entry. Shares then continued to creep higher for several weeks.


Euronet stock is now experiencing its first down week since making its move.

On April 2, shares were in the 20%-25% zone, based on either buy points, then reversed lower in heavy volume. After trying to rebound Wednesday in light trade, Euronet stock is off slightly again in active trade, down 0.7% to 141.03 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The Euronet stock chart still looks relatively sound. So why sell? Except in cases where a stock runs up 20% or more from the breakout in just a few weeks, investors should take at least partial profits when a winning stock advances 20%-25% from the buy point.


As IBD founder William J. O'Neil says, "The secret is to hop off the elevator on one of the floors on the way up and not ride it back down again."



Stock Of The Day Is Still Worth Watching
----------------------------------------


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-euronet-worldwide-inc-eeft.aspx) shows Euronet stock still has stellar fundamentals. This is reflected in its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 96. It is worth keeping tabs on the stock if it now goes on to build a new base.


[CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) know earnings are a key driver, and here it scores strongly. Euronet earnings growth over the past three quarters have averaged 21%, including 25% in the most recent quarter. The three-year growth rate is 17%. EPS has been growing for the last four years.


Even as the rise of digital payments has led to "Venmo" becoming a verb, cash has not gone out of style, and this is especially the case in the key overseas markets where Euronet operates its ATMs.


A key catalyst for Euronet stock is it is starting to collect lucrative currency fees when **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) cardholders use Euronet ATMs.


And while the use of ATMs may fall due to the rise of digital payments, there is a need for more machines, Piper Jaffray analyst Jason Deleeuw, who rates Euronet as overweight with a 145 price target, has said.


"Cash usage in Europe is much higher than in the U.S., especially in Central and Eastern Europe," he told IBD in November. "Also, ATM per capita in Europe is significantly below that in the U.S. ... so EEFT is serving an underserved ATM market."


India is also a growth market that offers a significant opportunity for the hot stock, with more people in India getting bank accounts as the country's financial services industry modernizes. The firm is also looking at moving into other overseas territories.

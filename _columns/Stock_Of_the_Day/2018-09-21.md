**Zoetis** ([ZTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares of the drugmaker loomed near a buy point Friday after rival **Elanco Animal Health** ([ELAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELAN)) began its [second day of trading](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/elanco-stock-pops-animal-health-ipo/).




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Zoetis stock dipped a fraction, to 89.83. Shares are close to a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 93.77 out of a flat base. If successful, this would be the third breakout for Zoetis stock since June.


The company makes medicines, vaccines and products for veterinarians and farmers to use in pets and livestock, respectively. Zoetis spun off from Dow Jones component **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) in 2013. Since then, its sales have grown 16% to $5.31 billion in 2017.


In the second quarter, the animal health firm easily [topped sales and adjusted profit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/teva-zoetis-report-second-quarter-earnings/) views. On a year-over-year basis, revenue has grown by double digits for the past three quarters. Adjusted income has tacked on double-digit growth for the past year.

Analysts are fairly bullish on Zoetis stock. It holds nine buy ratings and seven hold ratings, according to [MarketBeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ZTS/price-target/). Zoetis stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. That puts it in the top 4% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Animal Health Market
--------------------


In July, Zoetis completed its $2 billion [acquisition of Abaxis](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceutical-company-zoetis-buys-abaxis/), adding veterinary point-of-care diagnostics to its portfolio. During the acquisition announcement, Zoetis noted the market Abaxis targets grew at a 10% annual rate compounded over the past three years.


The transaction closed two months earlier than expected, Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a recent report. He kept his outperform rating on Zoetis stock, but cut his view for 2018 revenue by $15 million to $5.79 billion on a negative currency impact.


Scala kept his adjusted profit view intact at $3.10 per share, touching the high-end of guidance for $3-$3.10 for the year. He projects 2024 sales of $8.4 billion and a 2017-24 compound annual growth rate of 7%, above the broader animal health market at an estimated 4%-6%.


Positive Trends
---------------


In late August, CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo reiterated his hold rating and 92 price target on Zoetis stock. Loo expects the company's sales to reach $5.8 billion in 2018, following an 8.6% increase in 2017, he said in a note.


Pet ownership is increasing, and new products like chewable flea and tick medicines are becoming more popular, he said.


"We see positive trends for the companion-animal segment and modest, but improving, growth for its livestock products business, which accounts for 65% of sales," he said. "We see livestock product sales driven by new products and poultry products in Asia."

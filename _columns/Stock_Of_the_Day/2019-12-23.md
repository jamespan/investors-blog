**JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) amid buzz that the Chinese e-commerce giant's logistics arm is looking to raise $8 billion to $10 billion via an initial public offering. JD.com stock cleared a buy point.




Meanwhile, larger rival **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) continues to extend its breakout, while **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) closes in on a buy point and **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) consolidates.


JD.com Stock Hits Buy Zone
--------------------------


JD.com shares climbed 2.7% to 36.26 in Monday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), hitting 36.80 intraday. JD.com stock cleared a 35.53 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a short [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). Shares peaked above that level on Friday but closed the week just below the entry point. Volume for JD.com stock was above average, after a high-volume advance Friday.


JD.com stock broke out on Nov. 4, and on Nov. 15 it moved to 35.43 intraday following earnings before reversing lower. The stock continued to sink, hitting 30.84 on Dec. 3, when it rebounded from its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the chart below, has been advancing since late September, moving to a 16-month high. This means that JD.com stock has been outperforming the S&P 500 index.



The China stock has an [IBD Composite Rating of 88](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/).


Meanwhile, Alibaba stock boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. Alibaba stock rose 1.3% to 214.96, its seventh straight advance after hitting a record high last week. The e-commerce giant cleared a 188.38 handle buy point on Nov. 25 and is now greatly extended.


ZTO Express stock added 0.8% to 23.10, also its seventh straight gain. The Alibaba-backed shipping giant has a 23.22 buy point from a new flat base. That formed after ZTO Express stock plunged 6% on Nov. 19 following earnings. A day earlier, ZTO shares tried to break out ahead of results.


Pinduoduo, the No. 3 e-commerce player in China after Alibaba and JD.com, continues to consolidate after crashing Nov. 20 following disappointing results. Pinduoduo stock rose 1.4% to 37.89, just below its 50-day line. PDD stock has a potential 45.35 buy point.

JD.com Earnings Growth Strong
-----------------------------


JD.com earnings are well above the [25% growth sought by CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Over the past three quarters, EPS has grown by an average of 300%, though growth slowed in the most recent quarter to a still-blistering 142%. Over the past three years, earnings growth has averaged out at 100%.


Last month, [the Chinese e-commerce giant topped third-quarter estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-earnings-easily-beat-views-alibaba-rival-soars/). JD.com earnings per share jumped 142% to 29 cents. Revenue climbed 24% vs. a year earlier to $18.9 billion, the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. JD.com comfortably beat analyst expectations in both metrics.


JD.com also saw fourth-quarter revenue of $23.2 billion to $23.9 billion, above analyst estimates for $23 billion.


Annual active customer accounts rose 4% to 334.4 million. Mobile monthly active users jumped 36%. More than 70% of new customers were from lower-tier cities, JD.com said. In September, JD.com launched its social e-commerce platform, Jingxi, as part of its strategy to expand its presence in the lower-tier cities.


JD Logistics IPO
----------------


JD Logistics is targeting a valuation of at least $30 billion, [sources told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-logistics-ipo-idUSKBN1YR0NC). Management has held early talks with banks about a potential overseas IPO. The firm will use the proceeds for warehouse expansion and potential acquisitions.


JD.com spun off JD Logistics in 2017, but remains the majority shareholder.


Since being spun off, JD Logistics has opened up its delivery and warehousing services to outside companies. A 2018 funding round raised $2.5 billion from investors including Hillhouse Capital, Sequoia Capital China, China Merchants Group and Chinese internet giant **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)). Tencent has a strategic alliance with JD.com and owns a significant stake.


Tencent stock climbed 0.55% to 48.42, rebounding since late October after a long slide. Tencent, which trades over the counter in the U.S., has a potential buy point of 51.34.


If JD Logistics goes ahead with an IPO, a Hong Kong or New York listing could happen in the second half of 2020.


Analyst Rates Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Hans Chung last month rated JD.com stock as sector weight with a 34 price target. He was enthusiastic on the near term, but sees challenges ahead for JD.com.


"Despite higher bottom-line guidance for 2019 prompted by 3Q upside, implied net income in 4Q appears overly conservative, in our view, given strong November promotion, absence of irrational subsidies, and apparently no significant investment in new initiatives," he said in a Nov. 17 research note. "We believe lower-tier penetration could be a near-term driver for JD, but longer-term growth could be uncertain given competition."

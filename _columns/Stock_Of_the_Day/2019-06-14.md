**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as Wall Street favorably compares the Dow Jones stock to **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). [Disney stock](https://www.investors.com/research/disney-stock-buy-now/) briefly broke out of a second-stage base Friday while Netflix stock continues to lag the broader market.




Disney stock was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Friday.


Disney rose as a media and entertainment powerhouse on the back of its theme parks, television networks and movie studios, which just emerged as an even greater behemoth with the acquisition of Fox's entertainment assets. Now Disney is making a bigger, transformational bet on direct-to-consumer video streaming.


The company had already made streaming moves via majority-owned Hulu and the creation of ESPN+. But the launch of Disney+ later this year puts Disney more in direct competition with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)).


The unveiling of Disney+ in April with a deep library of existing content and new shows as well as a competitive price wowed analysts and sent Disney stock soaring. Since then, expectations have turned even more bullish.


Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Disney stock, saying the upcoming [Disney+ streaming service could ramp faster than Netflix](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-buy-point-disney-streaming-streaming-subscriber-estimate/). The analysts see streaming profitability in 2024, with a bull case for 100 million Disney+ subscribers by 2024.


Meanwhile, Disney's parks segment has seen robust growth and is continuing to bulk up, helping Disney stock further. Its [Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge land opened in Disneyland](https://www.investors.com/news/will-star-wars-galaxys-edge-be-crowded-not-if-disney-can-help-it/) last month to rave reviews. And Disney is adding a new [Marvel-themed land](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-nears-buy-point-amid-disneyland-marvel-expansion/) to California Adventure park.


Disney Stock Breaks Out Briefly
-------------------------------


Shares closed down 0.1% at 141.65 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), back below a 142.47 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) buy point after hitting 142.95 intraday. Volume was light. The overall Dow Jones Industrial Average fell fractionally. Disney stock gapped up on its Disney+ streaming unveiling in April, when it staged a cup-with-handle breakout past 115.90.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance against the S&P 500, hit a new high a day ahead of the stock's breakout, a bullish sign.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Disney stock is ranked No. 12 in IBD's diversified media group. But diversified media lags among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, ranked No. 122. Still, Disney stock held up better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the recent correction.


Disney stock has a less-than-ideal 79 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 59 EPS Rating.


Netflix fell 1.1% Friday, testing its 200-day average. Netflix stock's RS line is at 5-month low.



Spending To Weigh On Disney Earnings
------------------------------------


While Disney makes its transformational moves and add news attractions to its parks, investors in Disney stock will have to stomach weaker earnings as bigger investments take a toll.


Disney grew earnings at an 8% annual rate and sales at a 3% annual pace over the past three years. In the latest quarter, Disney earnings shrank 13% to $1.61 per share as revenue climbed 3% to $14.92 billion, both beating analyst estimates. Analysts expect Disney earnings to shrink 7% in 2019 and 1% next year.


But Disney expects the upcoming Disney+, as well as its existing Hulu and ESPN+, to be profitable by 2024.

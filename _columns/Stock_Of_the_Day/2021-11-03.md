**Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The chemicals firm is breaking out into buy range following strong Q3 sales.




Element Solutions might not be a household name. But the company's chemicals and coatings are in everyday products, from potato chip bags to the grill of a **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) F-150 truck.


The stock is also a major player in the tech sector. Its chemicals are used in cellphones and are needed to further develop artificial-intelligence technology.


The specialty chemical maker's stock soared in 2020 as sales of consumer electronic products rose as more people worked from home and looked to keep in touch with family and friends electronically.

On Oct. 27, Element Solutions reported third-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street expectations. Electronics segment sales rose 30% year-over-year to $399 million. Industrial & specialty unit sales rose 27% to $218 million.


The strong sales came despite supply-chain issues and a semiconductor shortage hitting its auto business. But the company cautioned analysts that it expects supply-chain issues to continue in Q4.


ESI Stock Is A Buy
------------------


Shares rose 3.8% to 25.37, hitting a six-year high on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) in double normal volume. On Wednesday, ESI stock broke out of a second-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 24.80 entry point, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). It's the fifth straight gain in above-average volume.


ESI stock flashed an early buy signal on Tuesday as it jumped 7.15%, rebounding from its 50-day line



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending up and just below highs, a sign of outperformance vs. the S&P 500.


ESI stock has a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of a best-possible 99 and an EPS Rating of 94. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


The Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which reflects institutional buying and selling of a stock, is a B+, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-element-solutions-inc-esi.aspx). That means there is more buying than selling.

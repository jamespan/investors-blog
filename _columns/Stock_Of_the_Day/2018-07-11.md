**Myriad Genetics** ([MYGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYGN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after it broke out Wednesday on an analyst upgrade noting trends in genetic cancer tests are improving.




Myriad stock spiked 13.2%, to close at 43.04, on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) after Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Beuchaw upgraded it to an overweight rating from equal weight. Beuchaw also boosted his price target to 55 from 35.


Shares surged past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 40.82 out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in [heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/). They closed more than 5% extended from that point. This followed a [brief breakout](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-paring-losses-dow-jones-lags-as-intel-tumbles/) on June 18 out of a cup-with-handle at 40.


Myriad's core business is selling tests to determine whether a patient carries a genetic risk of developing cancer. As those core sales stabilize, Myriad's high return on capital deployment could help earnings accelerate, Beuchaw said.

"We believe Myriad Genetics' earnings profile is dramatically changing," he said in a report to clients. "The core (hereditary cancer tests) business is showing durability above what bears give credit, with volumes returning to growth and price declines slowing."


Acquisitions Expand Myriad's Market
-----------------------------------


At the same time, key acquisitions are expanding Myriad's total addressable market. Among those, he noted the acquisition of Assurex Health in 2016. Assurex's tests look for psychiatric conditions and chronic pain.Â In May, the molecular diagnostic company announced its $375 million plan to acquire obstetrics [genetic screening outfit Counsyl](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/28/1512796/0/en/Myriad-Genetics-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Counsyl-Inc.html).


Insurance reimbursement for Assurex's Genesight, a genetic test for depression, is becoming clearer, Beuchaw said. There's now evidence showing clinical benefit and a cost benefit of determining which medicine could match with a specific patient's depression, he said.


Further, investors are excited about Myriad's planned acquisition of privately held Counsyl. The company provides genetic screening for expectant mothers and their families. For Counsyl, Beuchaw assumes steady gains of 100 basis points per year in market share.


Myriad's fiscal year 2019 guidance will be key this fall. This will likely include the impact of the Counsyl acquisition, set to close in the first quarter of Myriad's fiscal 2019. The outlook could drive consensus estimates 10% higher for the year, Beuchaw said.


"We believe the buy side has also not yet incorporated above dynamics into their views of the stock," he said.

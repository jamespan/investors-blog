ArcBest is the [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Thursday. Shares of the logistics and trucking company are clearing a buy point near all-time highs.




Fort Smith, Ark.-based **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)) is a diversified logistics company that offers trucking, freight and transportations services, as well as end-to-end supply-chain management solutions and technology.


Its less-than-truckload trucking fleet provided 65% of its 2023 revenue. The asset-light (or services) side of its business generated 35% of revenue.


The company is coming off a Feb. 6 fourth-quarter report that marked its first earnings gain after four quarters of double-digit declines. ArcBest's revenue fell in the last five quarters, but declines have slowed in the past two periods. Fourth-quarter and full-year earnings both topped analysts forecasts. Revenue came in just ahead of estimates.


ARCB stock received a 12-month price-target hike from Stephens on Feb. 7, to 205 from 165. The note cited strong operational execution in ArcBest's core less-than-truckload business. Stephens maintained an overweight rating on the stock.


ArcBest on Feb. 13 announced a new product called Vaux Smart Autonomy that uses self-driving forklifts, reach trucks and intelligent software to automate and streamline warehouse operations, as part of its Vaux Freight Movement System. ArcBest boasts that its Vaux system and technology can unload and load a trailer in less than five minutes and reduce wait times. It also require less hands-on work from employees.

ArcBest ranks third in the Transportation-Truck Group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). The group is led by **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)).

ARCB stock is clearing a [four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern that started after the early-February earnings report. The current pattern has an official [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 146.24, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) charts. Shares traded tightly within the pattern for the three weeks ending March 1.


Aggressive investors could use the 145.10 high within the pattern as an early entry opportunity.

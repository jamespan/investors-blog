**TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The off-price apparel and accessories retailer — which runs T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores — reported fourth-quarter results that beat forecasts, helped by holiday demand and market-share gains as rivals shutter stores.




The retailer also hiked its dividend and approved a new share repurchase program. TJX stock jumped to a new high on the news.


TJX Earnings
------------


TJX earned 81 cents per share during the quarter, above Zacks estimates for 77 cents. Revenue of $12.21 billion was above expectations for $11.85 billion.


Same-store sales grew 6% overall, crushing Consensus Metrix forecasts for a 3.2% gain. TJX's MarMaxx segment — that is, its U.S. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains — added 6%, above expectations for a 3.4% increase. Same-store sales at HomeGoods, an off-price home decor chain, grew 5%, more than double forecasts for a 2.1% increase.


In a release, CEO Ernie Herrman said strong holiday demand and a marketing push drove the results. During the company's earnings call, management said that market-share gains were "ripe for the picking" as other retailers close stores in every geography where it does business. TJX called out its teams in Europe and Canada, saying they pursued more relevant fashion brands.

'Very Cool,' 'Entertainment'?
-----------------------------


TJX, like other bargain retailers, tries to create a so-called treasure-hunt experience in its stores, where customers stumble into deals they didn't know they wanted. Herrman also argued that TJX is creating an "entertainment experience" that other brick-and-mortar stores didn't have. And he claimed that, in contrast to years past, the company was actually gaining cachet among younger shoppers.


"What once, maybe, wasn't as cool to give a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls bag has now become very cool," Herrman said during the call. "Which lines up with our younger customer base that we've been going after over the last five or 10 years."


The company also announced plans to boost its dividend 13% and buy back $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion in shares.


But TJX expects first-quarter earnings per share of 59 to 60 cents, below consensus views for 62 cents, on same-store sales growth of 2%-3%. For the full year, it sees EPS of $2.77-$2.83, below estimates for $2.85, on comp sales growth of 2%-3%.


TJX Stock
---------


TJX stock rose 7.15% to close at 63.99 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), roaring to a new high and back above a 61.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). However, with the coronavirus outbreak pushing the market into correction, Investor's Business Daily recommends against buying any stock amid the downturn.


Still, TJX stock is outperforming the broader market. IBD's research indicates that stocks that show durability during a correction can emerge as leaders when the market turns around.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for TJX stock also vaulted to a new high. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance against the S&P 500 index, is key during a stock market correction. Investors should build watchlists with stocks whose RS lines are rising to new highs, even if the share price is trending lower.



TJX Cos. stock has a 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its EPS Rating, a measure of profit acceleration, is 86.


Rival **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) rose 2.1% to 119.20 Wednesday, working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) with a 122.72 buy point. **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) dipped 0.5%. Ross Stores stock and Burlington Stores stock also have strong RS lines.


TJX has no stores in China. But, during Wednesday's earnings call, Herrman said it has several global buying offices and buyers who are traveling the world. A big chunk of TJX's merchandise is also made in China. The company declined to speculate on the coronavirus outbreak's possible impact.


The Covid-19 outbreak has forced companies like **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) to close stores in China. The big U.S. airlines have also pulled flights to the region. Companies like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) have warned about the virus's impact on business.


In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday it wasn't a matter of if, but when, the virus would spread more aggressively.

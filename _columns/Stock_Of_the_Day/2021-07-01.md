Dexcom stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the company squares off against giants **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) and **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) in the growing diabetes devices space.




Last month was bullish for Dexcom stock after two studies showed the benefit of continuous glucose monitoring for people with diabetes. **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), Abbott and Medtronic make these body-worn medical devices, also known as CGMs. They measure blood sugar in people with diabetes, helping them know when to take action to control it.


Shares sprinted more than 33% from the bottom of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) on May 13 to their [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on June 23.


Historically, CGMs have been popular with type 1 diabetes patients. In type 1 diabetes, patients don't produce enough, or any, insulin. These patients need frequent injections or wear an insulin pump. But there's a new push for CGMs in patients with type 2 diabetes, a progressive condition. BTIG analyst Marie Thibault expects Dexcom to benefit.

"Numerous studies on both Abbott's (body-worn) Libre flash glucose monitor and Dexcom's G6 CGM in type 2 patients underscored the benefits, including better glycemic control and lower hypoglycemia rates," she said in a report to clients. "We expect increasing support for CGM use in type 2 diabetes, including those patients not on intensive insulin therapy."


Dexcom Stock Eyes Several Entries
---------------------------------


After hitting a bullish streak through June 23, shares have reversed slightly, [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) shows. Dexcom stock briefly topped a buy point at 429.04 out of a cup base, but has pulled back below that level. Savvy investors could also look for an entry out of a high handle at 439.72.


Shares slipped marginally to close at 426.84 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). But analysts still see plenty of runway for Dexcom stock.


Early last month, Dexcom unveiled the results of two studies testing its CGM technology.


One study confirmed the benefit of CGM use in type 2 diabetes. Patients showed increased time in an appropriate blood sugar range, decreased incidents of high blood sugar and significant A1c reduction. A1c is another indicator for diabetes.


The other study highlighted Dexcom's newest CGM, known as G7. This device can pair with an insulin pump for more seamless operation. The study found nearly every reading with the CGM was clinically accurate and safe for treatment decisions.



BTIG's Thibault called the results "impressive." She has a neutral rating on Dexcom stock.


"We believe Dexcom's next-gen G7 sensor is likely to keep moving the field forward," she said.


But she noted investors will continue to focus on pricing and competition. UBS analyst Matthew Taylor says Dexcom's CGM has a roughly 30% price premium vs. Abbott. For this reason, Dexcom will likely lead the type 1 market, but grabbing share in type 2 diabetes "could be more of a battle."


Earnings In Decline As Sales Pop
--------------------------------


In the second quarter, analysts polled by FactSet expect Dexcom to earn 45 cents a share, minus some items, on $552 million in sales. Earnings would sink 43%, but sales would pop 22%.


That trend is expected to continue for the full year. Dexcom stock analysts call for sales to increase 21.5% to $2.34 billion. But earnings are expected to fall roughly 26.5%.


Both factors are reflected in Dexcom's middling [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) of 47 out of a total possible 99, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). This puts Dexcom stock below the leading half of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical growth measures.


Still, big-name mutual funds like Harbor Mid Cap Growth Admin and Artisan Mid Cap Advisor have sizable chunks of Dexcom stock.

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the leading subscription video-on-demand service gains customers during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has limited movie theaters and other entertainment options. Netflix stock hit a buy point on Wednesday.




The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company plans to report third-quarter results on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts are looking for another solid quarter as Netflix delivers a steady stream of fresh movies and TV series to keep homebound viewers entertained during the health crisis.


Netflix's new content in the third quarter included the second season of popular series "The Umbrella Academy" and buzzworthy movies such as "The Old Guard," "Enola Holmes" and "The Devil All the Time."


For the September quarter, Netflix had forecast adding 2.5 million new subscribers. In the [June quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-earnings-q2-2020-nflx-stock/), it added 10.09 million new subscribers worldwide, bringing its global total to 192.95 million subscribers.

Netflix Stock Eyes Multiple Buy Points
--------------------------------------


Netflix predicted third-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share on sales of $6.33 billion. In the year-earlier period, Netflix earned $1.47 a share on sales of $5.24 billion.


In intraday trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Netflix stock touched a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 557.49 out of [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/). Aggressive investors could have started a position on Tuesday as Netflix stock cleared a downward-sloping [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/).


Netflix stock dropped 2.3% to close at 541.45 Wednesday. Earlier in the session, it climbed as much as 3.3% to 572.49.


[IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts have identified another buy point at 575.47 from a 14-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).



Netflix Scores Two Price-Target Hikes
-------------------------------------


On Wednesday, two Wall Street firms raised their price targets on Netflix stock.


Cowen reiterated its outperform rating on Netflix and lifted its price target to 625 from 550. Goldman Sachs kept its buy rating on Netflix stock and upped its price target to 670 from 600.


In a note to clients, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said his firm's survey data indicates that Netflix could raise prices without much churn. Netflix last raised U.S. prices beginning in January 2019, with most increases completed by the second quarter of last year.


"Increased pricing power leaves the company well-positioned to raise (prices) as we head into 2021 and beyond, notwithstanding recent price increases in Canada and Mexico, among other markets," Blackledge said.


Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said he expects Netflix to add 6 million subscribers with its third-quarter report. He said Netflix has successfully fended off a wave of new competition. Those rivals include Peacock from **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA))-owned NBCUniversal and HBO Max from **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T))-owned WarnerMedia.

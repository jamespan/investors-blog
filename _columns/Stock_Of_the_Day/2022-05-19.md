Valaris stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the oil-and-gas drilling services provider flaunts an ascending base, a strong pattern in a bad market, with oil prices at multiyear highs.




Valaris Stock: Cozy With Oil Giant Saudi Aramco
-----------------------------------------------


Offshore rig owner **Valaris** ([VAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VAL)) emerged from bankruptcy protection a year ago. It lost money in four of the five quarters since its relaunch. But analysts see a profitable upturn by the third quarter of 2022.


The U.K.-based company boasts a fleet of modern drillships and semisubmersible rigs operating at many of the largest offshore production regions.


Valaris holds a 50% stake in ARO Drilling, the offshore drilling unit of oil giant Saudi Aramco.


Valaris and Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, have partnered in the Saudi Arabian market since 2006. Over the next decade, ARO Drilling aims to build 20 new rigs, supported by long-term contracts with Saudi Aramco, according to Valaris.


Saudi Arabia's expansion in the offshore market will create major demand for drilling services, according to ARO. Most of the country's current oil and gas production comes from onshore drilling.

Oil Prices At Eight-Year High
-----------------------------


Oil prices spiked past the $100 mark, after the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, for the first time since 2014.


Both Brent crude and WTI crude futures rose on Thursday to trade near $112.


Oil prices have upshifted as much of the world has shunned Russian oil following the attack, and as the EU considers a Russian oil ban or embargo. After the invasion, Europe especially has looked to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.


While much of the market has veered into a correction, energy stocks continue to act well, buoyed by higher oil prices. Several energy leaders have found a spot on the prestigious [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/) lists. Those oil stocks include **New Fortress Energy** ([NFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFE)), **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)), **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) and **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)).


Oil majors **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) are at highs and near buy points.

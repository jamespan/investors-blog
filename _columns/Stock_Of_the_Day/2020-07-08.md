MSCI Stock And Coronavirus
--------------------------


The company has put up steady earnings-per-share and revenue gains over the past five years. Management in April suggested MSCI stock was well positioned to ride out the coronavirus pandemic.


"The underpinnings of our business are also predicated on three things: data, huge amounts of data; a lot of analytics, one form or another; and an incredible amount of technology," CEO Henry Fernandez said on the company's earnings conference call in April.


"So as clients work even more remotely and don't rely on a lot of interpersonal issues, therefore, we should see an uptick on a lot of what we do with our clients."

Vista Outdoor is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the outdoor gear provider is offering another buying opportunity ahead of the Olympic Games. VSTO stock edged lower Wednesday, but rebounded from a key level intraday.




Vista Outdoor is the owner of the CamelBak, Bushnell, Remington, Federal Premium and other outdoor gear and ammunition brands.


Its Federal Premium ammunition brand is the official sponsor of USA Shooting at the delayed 2020 summer games. Vista Outdoor management said during its fourth-quarter earnings call in May that it was expecting tailwinds from the Olympics in Asian markets for its snow and bike helmets.


Meanwhile in the U.S., consumer retail spending is picking up amid a vaccinated summer. National parks have long lines as Americans are ready to spend another summer outside, this time with the parks open and welcoming visitors.

Vista Outdoor Stock Analysis
----------------------------


Shares rose 0.4% to 42.02 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), but off intraday lows of 40.86. VSTO stock broke past a 38.46 buy point in late May, rising to 45 before retreating modestly in below-average volume. Shares remain extended from that entry.


Investors have another chance to buy the outdoor gear stock as it rebounds off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) in a short consolidation, according to a weekly [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) chart.


Buying off the 21-day line is riskier than a breakout or off a 50-day or 10-week line bounce, but more advanced investors can still buy or add to their shares.



Vista Outdoor has a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of 99 and an 76 EPS Rating. The [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


Vista Outdoor has a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), indicating more buying than selling of VSTO stock among institutional investors.


The stock is ranked fourth in the Leisure-Products group which also includes recent [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/yeti-earnings-q1-2021-yeti-stock/) **Yeti Holdings** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) and leader **Fox Factory** ([FOXF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXF)).


Vista Outdoors reported fiscal Q4 results that beat Wall Street expectations. Vista earnings shot up 827% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 40%, the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth.


**Smith & Wesson** ([SWBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWBI)) earnings are due late Thursday. The gun and ammo maker's results could impact VSTO stock. SWBI stock is setting up in a cup-with-handle base.

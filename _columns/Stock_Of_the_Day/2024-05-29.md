**Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Robinhood stock advanced toward a new buy point Wednesday after the trading app announced plans for a $1 billion stock buyback program late Tuesday.




The $1 billion share repurchase program will take place over three years, starting in the third quarter, according to Robinhood. The move to buy back shares of Robinhood stock could signal the [IBD IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) is looking to move beyond its IPO startup label, scooping up shares it believes are undervalued.


Robinhood, the upstart online brokerage which made its public debut in 2021, has an inconsistent history of quarterly earnings. However, on May 8 the online trading platform reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue due to a surge in retail cryptocurrency trading.


Robinhood earned 18 cents a share, a big shift from a year-ago loss. Revenue surged 40% year over year, to a record $618 million.


Analysts expect the first-ever full-year profit for Robinhood stock to come in 2024, at 50 cents per share. In 2023, the company lost 61 cents per share.


"We delivered significant revenue growth and margin expansion in Q1 as we remain focused on driving another year of profitable growth in 2024," Chief Executive Jason Warnick said at the time.


"In Q1, we set records for quarterly revenues, net income and EPS, even as we stepped up our marketing and growth investments," Warnick added.

**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares continue to rebound from a steep sell-off. Tesla stock could hit a buy signal and form a new base if it passes a big test.




Canaacord Genuity's Jed Dorsheimer upgraded Tesla stock to buy and boosted his price target to 1,071, one of the highest on Wall Street, from 419. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Management has the highest at 3,000 by 2025.


But the latest bullish note isn't about Tesla's electric vehicles. Instead,Â Dorsheimer predicted the energy generation and storage business will accelerate 25% to $8 billion in revenue by 2025.


"While rich we also believe Tesla holds a several-year lead and is now expanding aggressively into storage and thus feel our multiple is warranted," he wrote in a note to clients Monday.


He adds that Tesla's focus on first-principle engineering will radically change the battery market, enabling the company to further lead in BEVs (battery electric vehicles) and expand into the solar and home energy markets with its Powerwall products.


"Tesla is rapidly creating an Apple-esque ecosystem of energy products, harmonized in electrification, to become the brand in energy storage," he wrote.


Dorsheimer says battery supply constraints will begin to alleviate in 2022, as the new 4680 cell design production comes online in Tesla plants in Nevada, Texas and Berlin, and with partners Panasonic and LG.


"Our data suggest Tesla has ramped home energy generation and storage campaigns already, building demand and leveraging its brand," he said.


Meanwhile, Tesla stock tokens will become the first on the [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901927/Trade-Stock-Tokens-on-Binance?ref=JLI1VBLA&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) cryptocurrency exchange based in Malta. Stock tokens are priced and settled in Binance USD (BUSD), a regulated stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Tesla Stock Analysis
--------------------


Shares rose 3.7% to close at 701.98 on the [stock market today,](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) but it has been hitting resistance at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), though it is back above the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


That 50-day level of support is setting up a big test. If Tesla stock can retake that line, it could be a buy signal for aggressive investors.


In addition, if shares can hold above that line by the end of the week, that would signal a new base with a 900.50 buy point.


However, the base's 40% depth to its low of 539.49 is on the outer edge of what is normal.


Another reason for caution is that Tesla stock is in a weak group. While legacy automakers like **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) are riding high, EV stocks like **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) and **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) and especially EV startups like **Lordstown** ([RIDE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIDE)) and **Fisker** ([FSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSR)) are severely impaired.


Potential buyers of Tesla stock may also want to keep in mind that the company reports earnings in just two weeks: after the market close on April 26.

BJ stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the deep-discount retail giant rises toward a buy point after a powerful rebound from a key technical level.




**BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) runs more than 200 stores in the U.S., selling everything from groceries and electronics to furniture and jewelry. It's a membership-only club like **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)). Both BJ's and Costco also sell gas and diesel.


BJ's Wow Deals enticed shoppers looking for deals during the ongoing rapid price inflation affecting groceries and other items. Its "value is king " business model has paid off for investors as well.


In addition, [strong fuel margins](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/musa-stock-gas-sales-fuel-margins-stoke-murphy-usa-casey-travel-centers-america/) have benefited gas-station operators like **Murphy USA** ([MUSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUSA)), which belongs to the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top growth stocks.

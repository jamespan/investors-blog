Stay-at-home entertainment leader **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day,](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the streaming video service gains ground during the Covid-19 pandemic. Netflix stock broke out on Monday.




Netflix is benefiting from increased viewership stemming from government shelter-in-place orders amid the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/). Analysts say the company is likely to see strong subscriber retention as well as new subscribers during the disease crisis.


In morning trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Netflix stock broke out of a V-shape cup-with-handle base with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 383.11. [V-shape bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/) are risky because the stock hasn't had time to go through a more natural price correction. But in this case, the base seems to reflect the stock market's volatility.


In afternoon trading, Netflix stock was up 6.7%, at 395.36.

Shares were near the intraday high of 395.88, which also is a 52-week high. The stock hit an all-time high of 423.21 in June 2018.


Netflix App Downloads Up 57% In March
-------------------------------------


Netflix's strength is evident in app downloads, research firm Evercore ISI said in a note to clients Sunday.


"After a sluggish start to 2020, Netflix's global download growth has gone gangbusters in March, as consumers sheltering in place globally are likely consuming content at an unprecedented pace," Evercore analysts wrote.


Global downloads of Netflix apps rose 57% year over year in March, its fastest pace since February 2016. Growth was fastest in the Asia Pacific region where Netflix app downloads jumped 124% in March.


International downloads rose 21% year over year in the first quarter.


"This data set alone suggests that Netflix is pacing towards about 8.5 million international paid net additions (vs. guidance for 7 million global net adds)" in the first quarter, Evercore said.


Netflix Stock Gets Price-Target Hike
------------------------------------



Also Sunday, brokerage Canaccord Genuity raised its price target on Netflix stock to 450 from 415. It reiterated its buy rating on Netflix stock.


"We are raising net subscriber addition estimates by about 21% for Q1 and by about 5% for fiscal 2020, due to an increase in demand for in-home entertainment options during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic," Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a report to clients.


The firm added, "The revision to net addition estimates reflects both an increase of new customer additions and a reduction of subscriber churn due to additional time spent at home and a lack of other entertainment options, particularly no live sports."


Hot new shows like "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness," "Love Is Blind" and the third season of "Ozark" have lifted Netflix viewership.


High Relative Strength, Composite Ratings
-----------------------------------------


Netflix stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92. That means it has outperformed 92% of stocks over the past 12 months.


Netflix stock also ranks first out of 18 stocks in IBD's Leisure-Movies and Related industry group. It has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key fundamental and technical growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group.

**McCormick** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after reporting strong earnings amid a home cooking boom. McCormick stock tested buy points Thursday, closing above one.




The firm manufactures and distributes spices, seasoning mixes and condiments. Its segments include consumer and industrial, which deals with restaurants and food manufacturers. A sharp rise in home cooking has offset weakness in restaurants.


McCormick earnings per share rose 27% to $1.47, well clear of the $1.16 expected by analysts, according to Zacks Investment Research. In addition, revenue grew 8% to $1.4 billion, besting expectations for $1.38 billion. That was the fastest McCormick earnings growth in nine quarters and the best sales gain in seven quarters.


McCormick Earnings Boosted By Covid-19
--------------------------------------


"Our results for the second quarter were significantly impacted by a shift in consumer demand resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic," CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a news release. "Our exceptional consumer segment growth was driven by the substantial increase in demand as consumers were cooking more at home.

However he said its industrial segment's results were "significantly impacted by sharp declines in demand from restaurant and other food-service customers."


Its consumer segment saw sales growth in the Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. However this was partially offset by a decline in the Asia/Pacific region.


McCormick withdrew full-year guidance on March 31. It did not offer any new forecasts Wednesday due to the "high degree of uncertainty about the pace and shape of the Covid-19 recovery."


Stock Of The Day Hits Buy Point
-------------------------------


Shares rose 3.6% to 178.54 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) after hitting a record 180.93 intraday. Aggressive investors could use 178.08 as their [buy point](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). However others may prefer to use its flat base buy point of 180.48, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The flat base formed after a mid-May consolidation breakout stalled.


The stock is trading above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), which is a bullish sign. The fact its 50-day line recently mounted the 200-day is also encouraging.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has also been building momentum of late, though it has yet to recover fully from a recent decline. Still, aside from a brief move into record territory in mid-May, the RS line for MKC stock has been range-bound since late 2018. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



McCormick stock has a solid [IBD Composite Rating of 86](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) out of a best-possible 99. Earnings are currently lagging stock market performance. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mccormick-and-co-mkc.aspx) shows McCormick earnings growth comes in at an average of 6% over the past three quarters. This is far below the [25% growth sought by the CAN SLIM cognoscenti](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). However EPS growth has accelerated for the past two quarters.


Before the latest results, analysts saw McCormick earnings per share slipping 1% in 2020 before rebounding with 3% growth in 2021.


McCormick earnings in the latest quarter got a big boost from the cook-at-home trend. But after stockpiling on spices, will consumers' spending habits return to normal?


McCormick sits at the summit of the [Food-Misc Preparation Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-24-2020/), which ranks 101 out of the 197 groups tracked.


Analyst Sees Trend Continuing
-----------------------------


Deutsche Bank analyst Faiza Alwy rated McKesson stock as a hold with a 156 target heading into earnings. While she thinks much of the upside is priced in, she expects sales growth to continue.


"While weekly data has moderated marginally, it remains elevated and we are forecasting organic (sales) growth of +2.8% in FY20," she said in a June 19 research note. "This assumes a deceleration in consumer from 2Q (to +10%) and an improvement in flavor solutions to (-8.4%). We assume elevated cooking at home to continue, but moderate."

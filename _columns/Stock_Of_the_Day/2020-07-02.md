**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as DXCM stock shrugs off a growing diabetes devices rivalry with [**Abbott Laboratories**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abt-stock-buy-now/) ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)).




Last month, Abbott gained Food and Drug Administration clearance for its Freestyle Libre 2, a body-worn device for diabetic patients. The Freestyle Libre 2 monitors glucose levels, alerting patients to dangerous spikes. It rivals Dexcom's G6.


But analysts don't expect Abbott to pose a major threat to Dexcom. The Freestyle Libre 2 can't be connected to automated insulin delivery systems, like those offered by **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) and **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)). That gives Dexcom a leg up on Abbott, they say.


"This suggests that while Libre 2 is coming with significant improvements in performance, it will still be slightly behind Dexcom's G6 on outlier and hyperglycemia alert performance/reliability," Cowen analyst Ryan Blicker said in a report to clients.

Blicker has an outperform rating and 430 price target on DXCM stock.


DXCM Stock Flirts With Breakout
-------------------------------


Shares of DXCM stock surged 7.7% on June 15, the day Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 gained the FDA's blessing. Abbott stock ended the regular session with a fractional boost.


Tracking glucose is especially important for diabetic patients whose bodies don't properly regulate that type of blood sugar. Dexcom's body-worn glucose monitor can be integrated with automated insulin pumps. These pumps respond with insulin to help control glucose levels.


But it could take a year for Tandem and Insulet to integrate Abbott's new glucose monitor with their automated insulin pumps, Piper Sandler analyst Matt O'Brien said in a report to clients. Then, these integrated systems may need FDA clearance, he said.



"When everything is considered, we still remain positive on Dexcom's competitive positioning given the more accurate sensor and ability to integrate with AID (automated insulin delivery) systems," he said.


O'Brien reiterated his overweight rating and 450 price target on DXCM stock.


Dexcom's devices allow patients to focus on their lives, rather than their diabetes, the company said in its emailed statement.


"The strength of our strategic plan for the future will help us continue our positive trajectory," Dexcom said. "As we execute this plan, we'll leave the investors to determine the value of our company."


Triple-Digit Growth Expected
----------------------------


DXCM stock is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) and a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 415.59. In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), shares rose 1.8% to 407.35. *(Related: Keep tabs on chart patterns by visiting IBD's [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).)*


Analysts also have bullish expectations for Dexcom's second quarter. The diabetes devices company is slated to [report its earnings](https://dexcom.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dexcom-schedules-second-quarter-2020-earnings-release-and) after the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) closes on July 28.


Then, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for Dexcom to earn 28 cents per share, minus some items, on $405 million in sales. Earnings would skyrocket 250%. Analysts see 20.4% sales growth.


Both metrics would put DXCM stock well within [CAN SLIM rules for investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), which say to look for stocks with 25% quarterly [earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/in-can-slim-quarterly-earnings-are-most-important/).


Highly Rated Medical Stock
--------------------------


It's also important to note that DXCM stock leads its industry group with a nearly perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 98, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). This Composite Rating puts DXCM stock in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical growth metrics.


Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating is a 1-99 measure of a stock's 12-month performance. So, DXCM stock ranks in the top 3% of all stocks on that metric.


Dexcom is also an [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock and is listed on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).

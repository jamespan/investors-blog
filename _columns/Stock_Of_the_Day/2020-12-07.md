Mexican fast-casual chain **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Chipotle stock is moving toward a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), after crossing an early entry.




The stock is setting up after Chipotle rose for much of the year, aided by its pickup, digital-order drive-thrus and delivery service during the coronavirus pandemic.


But it has faced higher costs recently. And the restaurant industry faces further shutdowns as cases rise, even as the nation prepares for a vaccine.


Chipotle Stock
--------------


[Chipotle stock](https://www.investors.com/research/chipotle-stock-is-it-a-buy-right-now-earnings-charts/) rose 0.9% to close at 1347.10 on the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). Shares are heading toward a 1366.76 buy point of a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base.


Also on Monday, the stock cleared a 1,346.10 early entry. Previously, shares had trended lower, after reaching 1366.66 on Oct. 21. But increases last week helped Chipotle break a short-term line and bounce above support at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Chipotle stock has a 72 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 49 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/). The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is off a peak that it reached in September.


The company's [third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q3-2020-chipotle-stock-buy-point/), reported in October, beat expectations. But higher delivery and food costs hurt margins. Same-store sales, at times, ran up against the popularity of last year's nationwide carne asada rollout.

Chipotle Enjoys 'Digital Moat'
------------------------------


However, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles this month called Chipotle stock one of the firm's best ideas for next year.


"In our view, CMG's symbiotic playbook focused on digital, loyalty, social responsibility & menu innovation will drive upside to 2021 comps as we model 12.5% vs 11% consensus," he said.


"We argue CMG's digital moat will continue to bear fruit, with an estimated 12.4% contribution to 2021 comps, fueled by a digitally-enabled second-make line that effectively doubles kitchen capacity to accommodate digital orders," the note continued. "CMG is poised to benefit as consumers naturally shift over time to frictionless & convenient digital-ordering for pickup, the highest margin order stream."


The chain is also testing smoked brisket. It also recently opened a restaurant [geared solely toward digital ordering](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-first-digital-only-kitchen-launch/).

**CrowdStrike Holdings** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm touches a new, aggressive buy point.




CrowdStrike stock hit an all-time high of 153.10 in intraday trading on Sept. 2 just before reporting July-quarter earnings.


CrowdStrike earnings and revenue topped estimates and guidance came in above Wall Street targets. But CrowdStrike stock fell amid high expectations.


The cybersecurity stock consolidated and formed an aggressive entry point of 143.80, with a 5% [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) that extends to 150.99. Also, investors should pay attention to the 21-day moving average of CrowdStrike stock as a sell signal.

On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), shares in CrowdStrike rose 4% to close at 142.87.


CrowdStrike Stock: Firm Taking Share From Legacy Players
--------------------------------------------------------


In some cases, it's worthwhile looking at a stock's 21-day moving average as opposed to the 10-day or 50-day lines.


The 21-day moving average of CrowdStrike stock now is around 132.


If CrowdStrike stock closes below its 21-day today, investors currently holding positions may want to divest. If the stock climbs and the 21-day rises with it, then investors can consider a longer-term moving average to trigger the sell signal.


Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike uses machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, and a specialized database to detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.


Demand for endpoint security has increased amid the corporate shift to remote work. Analysts say CrowdStrike has been gaining share from legacy security providers, such as **Broadcom**'s ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) Symantec unit and McAfee.


Zoom Video Communications A New Customer
----------------------------------------


Older antivirus software looks for "signatures" of known malicious software. However, more advanced machine learning tools, such as CrowdStrike's, learn to identify malware traits rather than specific signatures. That enables them to detect new types of malware.


On its July-quarter earnings call, CrowdStrike said it has added highflying **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) as a customer.



The cybersecurity firm holds anÂ IBD [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. That means it has outperformed 97% of stocks over the past 12 months.


CrowdStrike stock, meanwhile, has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on a scale of A+ to E, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


CrowdStrike Acquires 'Zero Trust' Cybersecurity Firm
----------------------------------------------------


CrowdStrike on Sept. 30 closed the acquisition of Preempt Security, a provider of "Zero Trust" tools, for about $96 million.


Traditional security measures aim to keep the bad guys out of corporate networks. Also, network firewalls focus on intruders from the public internet.


Zero Trust cybersecurity models establish trust based on the credentials of a user, device and application regardless of location (within the network perimeter or outside), according to a Morgan Stanley report.


CrowdStrike, **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), privately held Netskope and **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) recently formed a Zero Trust alliance.


Meanwhile, the CrowdStrike initial public offering in June 2019 raised $659 million with shares priced at 34. CrowdStrike stock has jumped about 185% this year.


In addition, the IBD-Computer Security group ranks No. 66 out of 197 industry groups.

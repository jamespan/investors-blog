**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the artificial intelligence chipmaker forms a bullish chart pattern ahead of its fiscal third-quarter report.




The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company plans to release its results for the quarter ended Oct. 29 after the market close on Nov. 21. Analysts polled by FactSet predict Nvidia will earn $3.33 a share on sales of $16.06 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, Nvidia earned 58 cents a share on sales of $5.93 billion.


Demand for graphics processors and data-center hardware for artificial intelligence applications has been fueling huge sales and earnings growth for Nvidia this year.


In a weekend note to clients, investment firm Evercore ISI called Nvidia "arguably the most important stock in the world right now."


Nvidia is a key player among "AI enablers, adopters and adapters," Evercore said. The firm rates Nvidia as outperform with a price target of 600. Evercore analysts noted that Nvidia stock "has made a stalwart defense of its months-long support line at $400."


Nvidia Stock In Double-Bottom Base
----------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Nvidia stock rose 1.7% to close at 457.51.


Nvidia stock has formed a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 476.09, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. In positive news for shares, Nvidia has risen above its 50-day moving average line.


But there are several caution flags for Nvidia stock. First, it has hit resistance at a downward-sloping trendline in the base. Also, there has been a lack of trading volume on up days in the past two months. Meanwhile, there have been number of down days in higher volume.


Chipmaker Is On Three IBD Stock Lists
-------------------------------------


Last week, Nvidia stock fell over concerns that [U.S. trade restrictions on China](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-sinks-as-china-trade-restrictions-set-to-crimp-sales/) would seriously crimp its sales. Restrictions on advanced chip sales to China are part of the Biden administration's efforts to keep artificial intelligence technology away from China's military.


Also, rival **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) aims to take a bite out of Nvidia's AI sales with its [MI300 AI accelerators](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-chipmaker-returns-to-growth-in-q3/), set to debut on Dec. 6.


On Monday, BofA Securties analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of 650.


Arya said he expects Nvidia to beat Wall Street's targets with its fiscal third-quarter results and guidance.


Nvidia stock is on three IBD stock lists: [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and [Tech Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-tech-leaders-nov-03-2023/).

Shale oil producer **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as DEN stock clears a buy point from a double-bottom base after finding support at its 50-day line.




Denbury centers most of its oil and gas production around the Gulf Coast and the Rocky Mountains.


On Thursday, oil prices were up as a drop in weekly U.S. jobless claims indicated the labor market remains strong despite a resurgence in Covid cases.


That's helping support oil stocks ahead of the Labor Day weekend, when Americans typically fuel up to go on road trips.


The oil sector has had a turbulent past week. Hurricane Ida slammed the Gulf Coast. Then [OPEC+](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-hurricane-ida-refining-opec-meeting/) announced that it would continue with its slow increase in production at its meeting Wednesday.


While refiners are currently assessing damage following the Cat 4 hurricane, analysts say that producers will be able to bounce back more quickly than their downstream partners who transport and sell the oil.

CLOSE




DEN Stock
---------


Shares jumped 5.4% to close at 74.00 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), breaking out from a double-bottom base with a 73.30 buy point, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The buy zone extends to 76.97.


Investors had an early buying opportunity around Aug. 26, when shares bounced above their 50-day line intraday. But DEN stock lost support at that level by the close of trading that day. It retook the 50-day line the next day and has held above it since.


Recent [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dvn-stock-buy-range-shale-stocks-oil-prices/) **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) is another shale player that has been able to find support at the key support line.



DEN stock has a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of a best possible 99 and an EPS Rating of 97. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


The company has bounced back from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September 2020, and is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration and Production group.

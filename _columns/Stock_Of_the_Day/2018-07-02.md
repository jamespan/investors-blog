**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The home-improvement retailer's stock is working on a buy point, as it tries to shake off the snow and rain that hit sales earlier in the year.




Home Depot stock has formed a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 201.70 buy point. Shares fell 0.55% to 194.02 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), closing near session highs after testing support at their 50-day line.


The Dow Jones stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 88, out of a best-possible 99. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), a measure of a stock's performance compared to the S&P 500, had hit a record high recently, ahead of the stock. The RS line has pulled back slightly in recent days.


Home Depot Earnings Growth
--------------------------


Home Depot earnings per share growth has accelerated modestly for the past three quarters, hitting 25% in the first quarter. Analysts expect a 27% gain for Q2. But sales growth cooled to 4% in Q1, missing views


Rival **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), also in a cup-with-handle base, lost 0.75% to 94.85. Lowe's is working on a 101.43 buy point.


Home Depot Emerges From Winter
------------------------------


Home Depot's [first-quarter same-store sales](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-reports-earnings-sales-miss/), reported in May, came up short of expectations. Management said cold, wet weather forced some customers to put outdoor home-improvement projects on hold.


Customers managed to complete indoor projects, management said, noting solid sales trends in categories ranging from ceiling fans to window treatments to floor maintenance. Sales in Home Depot's Pro segment — that is, the contractors and other professionals involved in renovating and repairing properties — outpaced those from DIY customers.


The housing market remained "favorable," Home Depot said in May. The company also held to its earnings-per-share guidance and remained upbeat on the second quarter as the weather improves. The company is also building out its "interconnected" retail efforts — including online sales and, in some areas, delivery and installation services.


Still, Moody's said higher labor costs and technology investments could weigh on the home-improvement sector's profits more broadly.


"So while we still expect favorable housing tail winds and positive consumer trends to continue," Moody's Vice President Bill Fahy said in May, "profit growth for the sector will likely be pressured."

**Tencent Music Entertainment** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and provides an opportunity to learn about investing in IPOs, which don't play by the usual rules.







A spin-off of China tech giant **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), Tencent Music priced its stock late Tuesday. [Shares began trading Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tencent-music-ipo-trades/) morning on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker TME. Tencent Music stock closed at 14, up 7.7%, on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Tencent Music is the largest online music entertainment platform in China. It owns the top four music apps, with about 800 million monthly users.


The selection of Tencent Music as the IBD Stock Of The Day is due in part to its unusually strong growth in sales and earnings for a new issue. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Tencent Music reported revenue of about $1.98 billion. That was up 84% from the year-ago period, with a profit of $394 million.

For its third quarter, Tencent Music reported adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share, up 100% from the year-ago period. That was the seventh quarter in a row of triple-digit gains. Revenue rose 65% to $722.2 million. Tencent Music has shown double- and triple-digit revenue growth over the past seven quarters.


It's not often that you see a new IPO coming out of the gate with this kind of numbers.


Tencent Music was formed in mid-2016 after Tencent Holdings bought a controlling stake in China Music Corp., and combined that with Tencent's own streaming business. Tencent Holdings is one of the largest internet companies in China, dominating the market in messaging services and gaming apps.


Lessons On Investing In IPOs
----------------------------


IPOs tend to draw a lot of investor attention. That often results in unusual and brand-new chart patterns that can be volatile as investors size up demand for the new stock.


As with any stock, wait for a proper base to form in order to spot a buy point that offers potential for big gains and lower risk.


The framework for identifying potential winners starts with the [development of an IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). In a good IPO base, the decline from peak to low usually isn't more than 20%. The length is often less than five weeks. These two factors alone make IPO bases wayward cousins compared with proper bases, such as the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), which need at least five to seven weeks of work.


The IPO base pattern typically starts within 25 days of the stock's first day of trading, but can also form in the first five to 10 days.


An example comes from the IPO of **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), a provider of high-speed optical-networking products. Acacia began trading on May 13, 2016.


Acacia stock priced at 23 and popped 35% on its first day of trading. It then formed an IPO base over the next five days. The stock broke out on the sixth day of trading, closing that day at 32.70. From that point Acacia stock quadrupled in price over the next four months.


Another example comes from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), then called Google, which went public on Aug. 19, 2004. It consolidated sideways for three weeks and then blasted higher on Sept. 16 above a 113.58 buy point. Just one year later, the stock was over 177% higher.


Key Selling Signals

With this kind of gains, it also pays to learn about and observe [key selling signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-wait-for-analyst-downgrade-learn-how-to-recognize-sell-signals/).


Investors studying IPO bases are partly blinded because new issues don't have enough trading history to generate tools like the Relative Price Strength Rating or the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as compiled in IBD's proprietary research tool, [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). There are ways to [evaluate these blind spots](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), however.

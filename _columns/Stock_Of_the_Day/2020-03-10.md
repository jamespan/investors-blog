China e-commerce giant **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as Alibaba stock is showing elements of being an IBD Long-Term Leader.




Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company in China, where it competes with **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and others for a slice of the country's giant economy. In addition to its various e-commerce platforms for businesses and consumers, Alibaba also operates a cloud-computing group as well as digital media and entertainment properties.


Revenue in 2019 jumped 45% from the previous year to $55.58 billion. Alibaba has been consistently profitable for several years.


Similar to **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Alibaba has made a big push into groceries and increasingly focuses on brick-and-mortar retail operations. Another growth driver comes from international expansion. The company manages to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.

Alibaba Stock History
---------------------


The company held its initial public offering in 2014 and remains the largest tech IPO ever. Alibaba stock priced at 68 and surged to 120 two months later. The stock then began sliding to an all-time low of 57.20 in its first year of trading.


The stock then consolidated for 10 weeks and broke out of a [cup-with-handle formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in early 2017. Over the next 15 months, Alibaba stock doubled.


The stock now trades below its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Alibaba stock [is not a buy now](https://www.investors.com/alibaba-stock-buy-now/), but a bullish move back above the 10-week line would strengthen its chart. A new [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) is forming with a 226.80 buy point, but Alibaba stock still has a ways to go to get to the buy point. Shares closed Tuesday up 4.4% to 206.39.


The outbreak of the coronavirus has cast a pall on China stocks lately. Still, several leading China stocks, including Alibaba, continue to hold up well.


Alibaba stock hit a record high in January, but with the coronavirus outbreak, action has been choppy. The stock's action has mirrored the stock market overall.


Among Alibaba's positive signals, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending upward and near a record high. When the line slopes upward, it means the stock outperforms the S&P 500.


Long-Term Leaders In Focus
--------------------------


Alibaba is on the watchlist of [IBD's Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). Some of the best times to buy these Long-Term Leaders come during the latter stages of market corrections like the current one. Stock market corrections can pull down even the best stocks. But IBD [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-long-term-stocks/) are companies with stable earnings growth and price performance. Often the best time to buy these stocks is during market weakness.


Alibaba has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97. The rating means Alibaba stock currently outperforms 97% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


The stock also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 90. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


Further, the stock earns an EPS Rating of 99, meaning its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth is outpacing 99% of all stocks. Alibaba holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group. JD.com is No. 2, followed by **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)).


The internet retail industry group ranks 42 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.


Delivering Torrid Growth
------------------------


For a megacap stock, Alibaba continues to deliver torrid growth. The company on Feb. 13 reported a [47% rise in quarterly profit](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/alibaba-earnings-q3-2020-alibaba-stock/). Sales increased 36% to $23.2 billion. Both figures beat Wall Street estimates.


Active consumers on Alibaba's China retail marketplaces reached 711 million, an increase of 18 million, or 2.5%, from the previous quarter. Moreover, active users on mobile devices reached 824 million, an increase of 39 million, or 5%. Revenue from its cloud operation jumped 62% to $1.4 million.


For its current fiscal 2020, [earnings per share](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/) are expected to jump 28%, with 21% growth seen in fiscal 2021.


During the conference call following the Alibaba earnings report, Wall Street analysts focused on what management had to say about the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the company's fiscal 2020 outlook.


During a call with analysts discussing the Alibaba earnings report, Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said that the coronavirus presents ["near-term" challenges](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-q3-earnings-121854933.html) to Alibaba's businesses that will have "significant impact" on China and beyond.

Workplace management software maker **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), raised $574 million in its initial public offering in early June. Monday.com stock climbed in six of its first seven trading sessions, then consolidated into an IPO base that provides a new entry point.




Monday.com competes with **SmartSheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)), **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)), **Adobe Systems**' ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) Workfront and several other companies. **Salesforce.com**'s ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) venture arm and **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) were pre-IPO investors in Monday.com stock.


Founded in 2012, Monday.com's software most often is used for task management or tracking projects.


"The company provides a work operating system that gives customers the ability to plan, run and track business processes, projects and overall work as well as build custom workflow apps," Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman said in a recent note to clients.

Monday.com Stock Forms IPO Base
-------------------------------


Monday.com stock launched its IPO on June 10, with shares priced at 155. Shares climbed over 15% the first trading day. Monday.com stock rose the next six trading sessions, hitting an intraday high of 237.50 on June 18.


Stock bases usually form in less than five weeks. But with IPOs, they can form in as little as seven trading days. Monday.com stock has traded in a tight range since June 21. Monday.com stock now trades just below its [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) entry point of 237.60. Shares were down 1.2% to 227.09 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


In 2020, Monday.com had revenue of $161.1 million, up 106% from a year earlier. Monday.com had a net loss of $152.2 million in 2020, up 66% from $91.6 million net loss a year earlier, according to its IPO filing.


Investments may delay profitability. For example, Monday.com has been building up its North American sales channels, analysts say.


Software Wave In Low Code And No Code Companies
-----------------------------------------------


Israel-based Monday.com is part of a wave of "no code" and "low-code" software makers. The no code and low code software makers enable customers to create apps using graphical programming tools instead of coded language.


"Our cloud-based platform is a no-code and low-code framework," according to a regulatory filing on Monday.com stock. "It consists of modular building blocks that allow our customers to create their own software applications and work management tools with robust capabilities. The categories of building blocks include items, columns, views, automations, integrations and widgets. With the platform's no-code capabilities, customers can adapt each building block to build software applications and tools that fit their desired use case and evolving needs."


As of March 31, Monday.com said it had 127,974 customers in more than 190 countries. Customers include Universal Music Group, **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), and Oscar Insurance.


Crowded Software Market?
------------------------


While the workplace management is getting crowded, Monday.com stock analyst Tillman said it's growing fast.


"The overall collaborative work management market has been developing for some time and there has been a proliferation of vendors entering and scaling their business in this high-growth category," Tillman wrote. "Importantly, we believe it is a large stand-alone software category and offers strong sustained growth prospects. We would not be surprised by continued capital raising as well as strategic M&A activity. We believe this is a market that can support multiple winners."

**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker is benefiting from healthy sales of chips for personal computers and game consoles this holiday season. AMD stock approached a buy point on Friday.




AMD stock has risen amid reports of [continued strong sales of PCs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hp-stock-dell-stock-benefit-work-from-home-trend/) fueled by the work-from-home and learn-at-home trends spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company makes central processing units, or CPUs, for personal computers and servers. AMD also makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, for PCs, gaming consoles and data centers.


Over the past 12 weeks, AMD stock has formed a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 88.82, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. An alternative reading of its stock chart shows an early entry point of 87.15.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMD stock rose 0.6% to close at 87.22. Earlier in the session, it climbed as high as 88.

AMD Could Get Cryptocurrency Boost
----------------------------------


Surveys indicate that notebook computers and video game consoles are [hot products this holiday shopping season](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/holiday-season-shortages-economy-dampen-consumer-electronic-sales-outlook/). In addition to making PC chips, AMD is supplying processors for **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Xbox Series X game console and **Sony**'s ([SNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNE)) PlayStation 5 console. The [Xbox Series X and PS5 consoles](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/sony-microsoft-ready-next-gen-video-game-consoles/) went on sale earlier this month. Both consoles are in short supply.


AMD also could get a lift from rising prices for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Graphics processors are used for mining cryptocurrencies.


Demand for GPUs for cryptocurrency mining is rising again, BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava said in a note to clients Wednesday.


"Although the impact seems minimal for AMD at this point, it is certainly worth keeping an eye on," he said. Srivastava rates AMD stock as market perform, or neutral.

E-signature company **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as it recently broke out of a long consolidation phase and continues to sit in a buy zone despite market turmoil.




DocuSign provides software that automates the electronic filing of contracts and digital certificates. Its tools prepare agreements and certify electronic signatures.


The company helped disrupt the standard process of sending and signing contracts, one of the last business processes to be automated. It competes with much bigger **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)). But DocuSign owns more market share in digitizing contract work.


DocuSign stock was in a lengthy consolidation phase. That was until the company reported second-quarter earnings on Sept. 5. Revenue jumped 41% to $235.6 million, easily topping estimates of $221 million. It was the 14th quarter in a row of double-digit growth.

DocuSign is 10th on the list in terms of Composite Rating.


RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin on Wednesday raised his price target on DocuSign stock to 80 from 75, with a rating of outperform. That followed a meeting Zukin held with the company's Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sheridan.

As a result, Zukin wrote, "We gained increased conviction around the opportunity for upside to numbers both short and longer term."

**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the biotech reaffirmed its 2020 outlook despite the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, VRTX stock broke out Monday.




In late March, Vertex confirmed the [supply chain and outlook](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-confirms-supply-chain-continuity-and-business-outlook-its) for its suite of cystic fibrosis drugs. But the [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) said several clinical studies would be temporarily paused or delayed due to the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/).


Still, VRTX stock has mostly stayed on an upward trajectory in the days following its update. Shares touched a record high on Monday.


"Most investors position Vertex as the most insulated from a commercial perspective — given the nature of the company's CF franchise," Credit Suisse analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note. "To this end, we do not expect any commercial headwind in the U.S., despite the pandemic."

VRTX Stock Breaks Out
---------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), VRTX [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) jumped 7.1%, to 255.30, breaking out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 249.95. In intraday trading, VRTX stock notched an all-time high of 256.42.


Vertex leads the market for cystic fibrosis treatments with four key drugs. Last year, the company nabbed Food and Drug Administration approval for Trikafta. Trikafta aims to treat up to 90% of people with the lung-wasting disease.


Last month, Vertex confirmed the supply chain and outlook for all approved medicines. Seigerman expects an impact, however, on negotiations for Trikafta coverage outside the U.S. Importantly, the biotech is running a study of Trikafta in children ages 6-11. That could expand sales.


Trikafta remains a bright spot for VRTX stock, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report. Adoption is progressing, "seemingly unhampered," he said.


"There continues to be significant community interest and the company believes the Trikafta launch has not been affected by Covid-19 so far, unsurprising to us as the CF patient population is well identified, motivated and educated," he said.


Several Studies Paused Or Delayed
---------------------------------


But Vertex also paused enrollment or delayed starting several key studies.


Enrollment in a study of an alpha-1-antitrypsin, or AATD, drug is on pause, Abrahams said. AATD is an inherited disease that can damage the lungs or liver.


"This is not surprising to us, as we believe most clinical studies will need to be paused and the AAT population may be especially susceptible to severe coronavirus due to their respiratory disease," he said. Still, he sees a $2 billion-plus opportunity for Vertex in AAT treatment.


Similarly, Vertex and **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)) aren't dosing any additional patients in tests of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia treatments, he said. He still expects updated data this year. Abrahams has an outperform rating on VRTX stock.



Credit Suisse's Seigerman notes the majority of other studies are also on pause so as not to place additional burden on the health care system.


"One of the challenges for Vertex is that 2020 is supposed to be the year for the non-CF pipeline; with trials on pause across the R&D platform investors may have to wait for substantive data updates," he said.


Vertex confirmed in an email to Investor's Business Daily that it still expects data from studies in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in 2020. It's more difficult to predict when the results of the AATD test could be available, the biotech company said.


VRTX Stock Is A Top-Ranking Biotech
-----------------------------------


Notably, VRTX stock ranks first among nearly 600 biotech companies tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Shares have a perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99. This puts VRTX stock in the top 1% of all stocks.


Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 96. So, VRTX stock ranks in the top 4% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.


The stock's relative strength line is in record high territory, a bullish sign as it outperforms the broader market.

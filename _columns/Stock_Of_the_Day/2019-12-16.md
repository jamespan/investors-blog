**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of computer-aided design software and workflow tools cleared a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/). Autodesk stock jumped into the buy zone on Monday.




On Nov. 27, Autodesk stock [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) of a 30-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) after the San Rafael, Calif.-based company beat Wall Street's targets for its [fiscal third quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autodesk-earnings-q3-2020-adsk-stock/) ended Oct. 31.


Autodesk stock moved in and out of the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) as it formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 181.65. It broke out of that pattern on Monday, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. But [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/) was slightly below average. It's an unusual entry, because most of the time the three-weeks-tight pattern forms after the stock has progressed from the initial buy point. In this case, the three-weeks-tight entry is near the base's.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Autodesk stock rose 2.8%, near 184.37. In intraday trading, it notched an all-time high of 184.87.

Seven Straight Quarters Of Triple-Digit Earnings Growth
-------------------------------------------------------


Autodesk has posted seven consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth in earnings per share on an absolute value basis. It has reported eight straight quarters of double-digit gains in sales.


Autodesk is profiting from its shift to cloud computing and software-as-a-service from licensed software sales.


However, its guidance for the current quarter was lighter than Wall Street forecast. Autodesk expects to earn 89 cents a share on sales of $887.5 million in its fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 31. That's based on the midpoint of its outlook. Wall Street was modeling Autodesk earnings of 92 cents a share on sales of $897 million. In the year-earlier period, Autodesk earned 46 cents a share on sales of $737 million.


Autodesk Stock Called A Top Pick For 2020
-----------------------------------------


On Thursday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Autodesk stock with a 12-month price target of 190. The investment bank held a meeting last week with Autodesk Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren and other executives.


"One of the areas of debate on the stock remains the resiliency of the business model in the event of a macroeconomic downturn, particularly as the company has transitioned away from a perpetual-plus-maintenance model to subscription," analyst Heather Bellini said in a note to clients. "Management noted that maintenance revenue continued to grow in the low single digits during the financial crisis despite customers' ability to churn off maintenance while still using the software. With 96% recurring revenue, management believes that the subscription business model will ultimately prove more resilient in a downturn."


Also Thursday, Mizuho Securities named Autodesk stock as one of its top picks among software stocks for 2020.


Analyst Matt Broome maintained his buy rating on ADSK stock with a price target of 195.


Autodesk currently is benefiting from the successful conversion of its customer base to subscriptions, Broome said. It has room to increase pricing over time for its architecture, engineering and construction software products, he said.


Autodesk Ranks Fourth In Design Software Group
----------------------------------------------


Autodesk stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 87. That means it has outperformed 87% of stocks over the past 12 months. The best growth stocks typically have RS Ratings of at least 80.


It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 87 out of 99. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Autodesk ranks fourth out of 11 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Design industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-autodesk-inc-adsk.aspx). Three peers with better combined financials and technicals include **Ansys** ([ANSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANSS)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) and **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)).

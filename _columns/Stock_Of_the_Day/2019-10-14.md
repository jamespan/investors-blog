**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the medical aesthetics company has nearly doubled in value and approaches what's expected to be another quarter of growing profitability.




During the third quarter, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect InMode to report adjusted income of 29 cents per share. On a year-over-year basis, that would be a jump of nearly 12%.


Analysts are impressed with [InMode stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/inmode-stock-rockets-month-dives-medical-aesthetics/), which [went public in August](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stock-inmode-breakout-zoom-video-earnings-slated/). It can take some time for medical stocks to become profitable. But InMode is in the medical aesthetics field which, is "large and growing," according to Barclays analyst Jack Meehan.


"We believe there is good near-term visibility for growth as InMode drives commercial expansion, achieves greater international reach, and builds greater levels of recurring revenue," Meehan said in a recent report to clients.

InMode Stock Gets Overweight Rating
-----------------------------------


In the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), InMode stock popped 11.5% higher to close at 27.17. As of Monday's close, shares were 94% ahead of their [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-ipo/) price at 14.


Meehan initiated coverage of InMode stock, which briefly held a slot in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) in September, with an overweight rating and 27 price target.


The medical aesthetics company uses radio-frequency technology. It has devices for plastic surgery, gynecology, dermatology, otolaryngology (ears, nose and throat) and ophthalmology.


It calls its flagship product BodyTite, a minimally invasive method of body contouring. The product is still early in its adoption curve, Meehan said.


Medical Aesthetics Market Is Growing
------------------------------------


Further, at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons annual meeting in September, InMode showcased its recently launched Evolve platform, Canaccord Genuity analyst Kyle Rose said in a recent note. The platform combines body/skin tightening and electric muscle stimulation.


Athletes use electric muscle stimulation as a strength training or rehabilitation tool.



"It is the only hands-free skin tightening system available in the U.S., so the addition of both body tightening and (electric muscle stimulation) serves as a strong competitive selling point as it provides physicians with a effectively three systems for the price of one," he said.


He noted the electric muscle stimulation function is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration review. But the medical aesthetics company is currently taking orders and expects that piece of the product to be available by year's end.


InMode Stock Has High Ratings

InMode will report its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 5.


Then, analysts expect the company to post $35 million in sales, up 38% year over year. Analysts expect revenue growth to continue in the following quarters. In the fourth quarter, analysts project InMode's sales will pop 49%. The company has reported triple-digit earnings gains in seven of the last nine quarters.

**Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after guiding first-quarter and full-year EBITDA estimates ahead of Wall Street expectations late Tuesday. CLF stock flashed a buy signal Wednesday.




The steelmaker sees [first-quarter adjusted EBITDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cleveland-cliffs-announces-first-quarter-201500312.html) of approximately $500 million and Q2 EBITDA of approximately $1.2 billion. That's above analyst estimates or $388 million in Q1 and $1.03 billion in Q2.


Cleveland-Cliffs also sees full-year EBITDA of $3.5 billion, assuming hot rolled steel prices averages $975 per net ton for the remainder of the year. Analysts expect EBITDA of $2.87 billion.


The steelmaker plans to announce full Q1 results before the market opens on April 22.


Cleveland-Cliffs became the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America after acquisitions last year of ArcelorMittal USA and AK Steel, transforming from an iron ore miner.


The revamped company is poised to ride a resurgent car industry and overall manufacturing sector. President Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan is likely to be bullish for steelmakers as the administration has big plans to fix 10,000 bridges and eliminate lead pipes in water supplies.


In Q4, 41% of Cleveland-Cliffs' $2.1 billion in steelmaking revenue came from the automotive market, 24%, of sales to other steel producers, 18% from the distributors and converters market, and 17% from the infrastructure and manufacturing market.

CLF Stock Chart Analysis
------------------------


Shares jumped 16.65% to close at 20.11 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), the highest finish since 2014. CLF stock has a complicated chart. [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) pattern recognition shows an 18.87 buy point from a consolidation. But a deeper analysis reveals more appropriate buy points of 18.06 from a double-bottom base, as well as 17.88 from a handle.


Technically, Wednesday's surge means CLF stock is already extended as the buy range maxes out at 18.96 for the double-bottom base, and 18.77 for the handle.


But CLF stock is still sending a buy signal as it broke short-term resistance near 18.77 while the relative strength line hit a new high. And historically, big breakouts often lead to big gains. A close below today's low of 18.27 would be a sell point.


Still, more conservative investors could also wait for CLF stock to pull back to a more conventional buy range.


Among other top steel stocks, **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) rose 2.1%, **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) fell 1%, **Nucor Corp.** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) lost 0.15% and **Ternium SA** ([TX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TX)) eased 1.2%.

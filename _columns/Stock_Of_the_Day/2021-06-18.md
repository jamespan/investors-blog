**Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as dentists embrace digital orthodontics, buoying Invisalign-maker Align and ALGN stock.




The Covid pandemic challenged dentists. How does one treat oral disorders and straighten teeth while protecting against a virus that spreads through aerial saliva and mucus?


Enter Invisalign.


Dentists use three-dimensional scanners to capture dental images. Align uses those images to create a series of progressive aligners. Those aligners — Invisalign — put pressure on specific problems spots in the teeth. Today, demand is just a notch below pre-pandemic levels, analysts say. Align told Investor's Business Daily that the pandemic changed the way it does business.

"Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, many Invisalign doctors around the world pieced together video calls, texts and patient-submitted photos through a variety of platforms to help monitor patient progress, reduce in-office appointments and ensure continuity of patient care during treatment," the company said in an email. "In response, Align Technology launched a set of digital tools to support doctors."


Those tools enable dentists to manage a wide array of services remotely.


ALGN Stock: Long Runway For Growth
----------------------------------


Align also has a long runway for growth, Chief Financial Officer John Morici said during a recent conference. Today, more than 80% of the orthodontics market uses traditional wires and brackets. Clear aligners, like Invisalign, are growing but remain in the minority, he said.


Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson expects demand to continue through 2021 and beyond. Google search volume for Invisalign — which usually correlates to U.S. orders for Align — has accelerated since the initial lockdowns ended, she said in a May report to clients.


This "lends credence to the idea of a more structural shift to digital dentistry/orthodontics," she said.


Anderson has an outperform rating on ALGN stock.



Analysts covering ALGN stock expect a major boom in second quarter. They call for earnings to reverse from year-earlier losses to $2.54 per share, minus certain items. Sales are expected to surge 166% to $938 million. That would follow a deep trough in the year-earlier period at the height of the pandemic.


The digital economy will be part of that, Align told IBD.


"In a macro sense, Covid-19 has accentuated the digital economy, and practices across every region are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposefully than ever before," the company said. "Invisalign providers are using our virtual tools to minimize in-office appointments and deliver doctor-directed, personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment — and that will re-shape the future of treatment."


Highly Rated Medical Stock
--------------------------


ALGN stock investors are taking notice. On a year-to-date basis, ALGN stock has popped 14.8% as of Thursday's close. Shares are forming a [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 647.30. But ALGN stock could also be actionable at 615.80 above a small handle, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Bullishly, ALGN stock has an almost-perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. That puts shares in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical growth rates, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital).


ALGN stock also has a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 89. The RS Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. Leading stocks tend to have RS Ratings of 80 before big price runs.

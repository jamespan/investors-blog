As travel restrictions loosen globally and Covid vaccinations increase, leisure and travel stocks are getting renewed attention.Â Airbnb stock, which bottomed out on July 19, has moved steadily upward since then, climbing about 35% through Wednesday.


Bullish Technical Note On ABNB Stock
------------------------------------


On a bullish technical note, ABNB stock has jumped back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and the key 50-day line, which had been sliding since mid-April but now is rising again. [The 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) plots a stock's average closing price over the 50 most recent trading sessions.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), though not strong, is ticking upward. The RS line measures a stock's strength against all stocks in the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.


Airbnb Stock Jumps On IPO
-------------------------


Airbnb made a big splash last December with an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/airbnb-ipo-initial-public-offering-valuation-doordash-abnb/) that raised $3.5 billion and widely exceeded heightened expectations. ABNB stock soared by triple digits on its first day of trading.


The company competes with other online travel platforms such as **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and **Trip.com** ([TCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCOM)). It also faces competition from search engine sites like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))'s Google, **TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) and **Trivago** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)).


San Francisco-based Airbnb was founded in 2008 as Airbed & Breakfast, operating an online marketplace for lodging. Its marketplace model connects hosts and guests online or through mobile devices to book spaces. Primary offerings are homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities.


Business Rebounded In Second Quarter
------------------------------------


After getting hammered by the pandemic travel slowdown, Airbnb's business started to rebound late in the second quarter as domestic travel picked up. The rebound was driven almost entirely by domestic travel, or stays within a 50-mile radius of a traveler's home.


The [IBD Stock Checkup too](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-airbnb-inc-cl-a-abnb.aspx)l shows that Airbnb stock has a weak [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 48 out of 99, though it was 24 on Thursday. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors easily gauge a stock's strengths.


The stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 67. This means ABNB has now outperformed 67% of all companies in the IBD database, which is not great but better than the 59 posted on Thursday. The RS stood at a healthier 72 earlier in October.


Airbnb is also an [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).

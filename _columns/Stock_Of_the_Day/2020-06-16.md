**TechTarget** ([TTGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTGT)) is the IBD Stock of the Day as the online technology media company breaks out from an alternate buy point. TechTarget stock has been getting a boost from resilient demand for its tech sales and marketing programs during the coronavirus pandemic.




The Newton, Mass.-based company brings together buyers and sellers of corporate technology products. It helps technology providers generate sales leads, shorten sales cycles, and grow revenues.

TechTarget stock rallied nearly 80% from mid-March through mid-June. Shares plunged in February and early March as the coronavirus turned into a pandemic but they have rebounded as technology-driven stocks drive the market rally.


The IBD Commercial Services-Advertising group it belongs to ranks No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked. TechTarget is the No. 2 stock in this group, behind **The Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)).

TechTarget Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------------


TechTarget stock surged 5.9% to 30.72, topping a 30.11 alternate buy point Tuesday, well above the 50-day line, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It's extended off an earlier 28.42 entry cleared June 5. This isn't a clean pattern. It could have been breaking out of a cup base, or a double-bottom base, depending on how you interpret the chart.


Average trading volume on TechTarget stock is also low, meaning investors should be wary of individual trades swinging shares.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has risen since the beginning of 2019 but remains below all-time highs. The RS line, measuring a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is the blue line in the chart shown.


TechTarget stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of 88 out of a possible 99. The best stocks own ratings above 80.


TechTarget stock's Composite Rating, which combines fundamental and technical metrics, is an impressive 97.


Moreover, TechTarget stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-techtarget-inc-ttgt.aspx). **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) leads its group with an A+ A/D Rating.


The A/D rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.



TechTarget Earnings
-------------------


Last month, the firm reported first-quarter earnings of 19 cents a share, meeting views, while revenue rose 4.8% to $31.42 million, missing views, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Combined with Q2 guidance showing normal sequential increase in revenue, the results spoke to the relative resiliency of demand for TechTarget's programs. Those include purchase-intent marketing and sales services for tech professionals.


Wall Street expects EPS to fall 3.9% in Q2 but to rise 3.1% for 2020 as a whole.


Earnings growth averaged 34% over the last three quarters, below the three-year EPS growth rate of 57%. That contributes to an EPS Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99. Sales growth has been weaker, averaging 9% over the past three quarters and 10% over the past three years.

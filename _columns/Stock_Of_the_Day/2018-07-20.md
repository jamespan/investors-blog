**Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Da](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/)y selection, a feature that can help you identify the best stocks to buy and watch and improve your [stock-picking skills](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).







Workday has consistently grown quarterly revenue at a double-digit pace, and done so profitably. The company provides cloud-based services to help companies manage human relations, payroll and other business functions.


Workday stock currently is in [buy range](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) after rising past an earlier entry point in an uncommon pattern known as [Shakeout + 3](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-why-the-shakeout-3-pattern-makes-money/). The current buy point for Workday stock is 137.53, based on a new handle that stemmed from a [bullish double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-double-bottom-base-first-starts-out-as-a-cup/).


Like the double bottom, the shakeout + 3 features two sharp sell-offs, and the second drop undercuts the first low.

The pattern known as shakeout + 3 is similar to the double-bottom pattern. It might not occur as often as the double bottom, but it carries many of the same elements of price-and-volume action. By searching for this pattern, you're also training your eyes for the double bottom.


Spotting A Shakeout + 3
-----------------------


What is advantageous about spotting a shakeout + 3 pattern is that it can yield an earlier entry point than a double bottom or handle. In this example, the buy point from Workday's shakeout + 3 was 129.65, vs. the more expensive handle buy point of 137.53.


Not to make things too confusing but, in the case of Workday, it's a shakeout + 9.


How come? Workday stock trades at a triple-digit level, currently near 133 a share. Hence, Workday needed to rise at least 9 points, or triple the shakeout+3 requirement.


The starting point from where this begins is the first low in the double-bottom base. Therefore, the Workday point is 120.65 plus 9. Workday stock may still be bought when it crosses the handle buy point of 137.53.


Workday shares fell 0.5% to 132.33 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Workday stock is up 29% in the past 12 months.


Workday provides cloud-based software for human relations, payroll and other business functions. It has expanded from human capital management software into financial management software.


Workday reported first-quarter earnings on May 31. Revenue rose 29% to $618.6 million from the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings, at 33 cents per share, rose 14%. Workday held its initial public offering in October 2012, pricing shares at 28. The company is based in Pleasanton, Calif.\

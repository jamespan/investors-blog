Mattress maker **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with TPX stock clearing a tight buy point Friday following raised fourth-quarter targets.




That comes amid strong demand for bedding and furniture stocks, such as **Sleep Number** ([SNBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNBR)) and **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)).


Tempur Sealy Stock Analysis
---------------------------


TPX stock, which is on the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), rose 3% to 26.35 in Friday's [stock market trading,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) clearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 26.05 from a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern. That three-weeks-tight is just above a prior pattern. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Tempur Sealy stock is just below the best levels since late February.



Stock Of The Day Raises Guidance
--------------------------------


On Wednesday, Tempur Sealy said it expects Q4 adjusted EBITDA growth of about 30% on low double-digit net sales growth.


Stronger-than-expected U.S. e-commerce and international sales are fueling Tempur Sealy's improvement, along with favorable company-wide margins. Chairman and CEO Scott Thompson said "online direct-to-consumer Tempur-Pedic and Cocoon by Sealy businesses are experiencing triple-digit sales growth over the comparable prior-year quarter."


The company also said it's targeting share repurchases of about $280 million for 2020, including approximately $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter.


TPX stock boasts a near-perfect 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). All-time stock winners tend to have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of big runs. TPX stock has an EPS Rating of 81 and an RS Rating of 79.


CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon also is optimistic about Tempur Sealy's outlook.


"We see 12% to 15% revenue growth in Q4 2020, as TPX is constrained by the shortages in the supply chain for materials like innersprings for Sealy mattresses," he wrote in a recent note. "Nonetheless, our more bullish view of TPX's outlook is based on its products in high demand with the secular shift to in-home consumer discretionary spending from other areas like travel and restaurants due to Covid-19."






Leon says Tempur Sealy has the potential to boost the number of stores selling its mattress products from new channel partners such as Mattress Firm and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).






Lovesac Stock
-------------


Early Wednesday, modular couch and bean bag maker Lovesac reported a surprise profit of 16 cents a share, blowing away views for a loss of 88 cents a share. Revenue jumped 43.5% to $74.7 million, topping estimates for $66 million.






LOVE stock jumped 19.5% on Wednesday to 40.41, clearing a 38.03 entry from a cup base. Shares on Friday reversed lower from an 18-month high, sinking 5% to 38.69.

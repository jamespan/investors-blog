Incyte stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) amid a breakout and enthusiasm for the biotech company's diversifying pipeline and $2 billion war chest.




Shares of **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) briefly topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 89.40 out of a [consolidation](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/base--op-and-base-patterns-cma--base--building-cma--price-consolidation-area-cma--price-pattern-cp-) that began forming in June. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Incyte [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) climbed 1.1% to 88.90. [Volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/) was tracking above average but was below the 40% minimum increase desired in breakouts.


The biotech company recently posted 25% growth in [third-quarter sales of Jakafi](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/incyte-earnings-incyte-stock-q3-2019/), a cancer drug. Jakafi represented nearly 79% of Incyte's revenue during the period. CFRA analyst Kevin Huang notes Incyte has "significant revenue concentration in Jakafi."


But "we don't anticipate any considerable competitive threats to Jakafi's dominant position in the treatment of (blood cancers) myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera for at least the next several years," he said in a note to clients. "In addition, Incyte's key patents for (Jakafi) are valid until December 2027."

Jakafi Sales Are Key — For Now
------------------------------


The Food and Drug Administration has approved Jakafi to treat two blood cancers as well as acute graft vs. host disease. The latter is a complication of a stem cell transplant.


During the [third quarter, Jakafi generated](http://investor.incyte.com/news-releases/news-release-details/incyte-reports-2019-third-quarter-financial-results-and-provides) $433.39 million in sales. The biotech company raised its full-year outlook to $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion in sales of Jakafi. At the midpoint, sales of Jakafi would rise 20% year over year.


Incyte still has big [development plans for Jakafi](https://www.incyte.com/what-we-do/pharmaceutical-portfolio). The biotech company is also studying the drug as a treatment for chronic graft vs. host disease and a blood cancer called essential thrombocythemia. In addition, the company is testing a cream form of the drug for skin conditions eczema and vitiligo.


Notably, outside the U.S., the drug is licensed to **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)).


The biotech company expects to have Phase 3 results from a study of Jakafi cream in eczema in mid-2020, CFRA's Huang said. For now, the narrative around Incyte stock remains focused on Jakafi, Credit Suisse analyst Evan Seigerman said in his recent note to clients.


"We continue to forecast significant growth for Jakafi and believe that the drug should reach long-term company estimates," he said. "We also could see modest sentiment-driven upside near term given multiple catalysts expected in the next 12 months that should shift the narrative away from Jakafi."


Biotech Company Tests Other Drugs
---------------------------------


Outside of Jakafi, Incyte is testing a drug called itacitinib in patients with acute and chronic graft vs. host disease. The biotech company is also hoping itacitinib could work in an inflammatory condition known as ulcerative colitis.


Incyte could present Phase 3 test results of itacitinib in graft vs. host disease before year's end, CFRA analyst Huang said. If successful, he expects the biotech company to file for FDA approval of the drug.


In total, Incyte has 16 ongoing midstage studies and 12 earlier-stage programs, he said.


Of those earlier programs, Credit Suisse's Seigerman also sees promise for drugs called pemigatinib and capmatinib. Both are potential cancer treatments. Pemigatinib is currently in a pivotal study as a treatment for cancer of the bile ducts. Novartis has licensed the worldwide rights to capmatinib.



RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams expects several of these drugs to propel Incyte stock in 2020. In particular, he sees promise for pemigatinib in a large population of bladder cancer patients. He has a sector perform rating on Incyte stock.


"Ultimately, we continue to see potentially more meaningful pipeline readouts in 2020 that could drive increased investor attention for shares and help provide visibility on revenue sustainability potential beyond Jakafi's out-year patent cliff," he said in a recent report.


Could Incyte Buy Something?
---------------------------


Credit Suisse's Seigerman also noted the biotech company has "significant capacity" for mergers and acquisitions. The biotech company has $2 billion in cash and no debt, he said.


"The company is focused on bolt-on assets to leverage the commercial infrastructure along with midterm pipeline development," he said in a report.


CFRA's Huang also noted Incyte has "plenty of capacity to engage in opportunistic M&A."


But Huang has a hold rating on Incyte stock. Seigerman has a neutral rating on the biotech company. Both are awaiting more details about the company's efforts to diversify away from Jakafi.


Incyte Stock Has High IBD Ratings
---------------------------------


Still, Incyte stock is outperforming the broad base of biotech companies. As of Tuesday's close, on a year-to-date basis, Incyte stock had climbed more than 38%. That compares with a less bullish 12%-plus creep up for the industry group of more than 500 biotech companies.


Among them, Incyte stock is ranked fourth by [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), a 1-99 measure of key technical and fundamental growth metrics. Incyte stock has a Composite of 98 and trails behind leader **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), which is soon to be acquired by [**Bristol-Myers Squibb**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/bmy-stock-buy-now/) ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)).


Biotech leader Incyte also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 80. The RS Rating tracks a stock's 12-month performance. Leading stocks tend to have RS Ratings at 80 or above.


Incyte's [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) is a strong 98 out of a best-possible 99. The EPS Rating measures a stock's recent profitability. In the last two quarters, Incyte tacked on 19% and 100% growth in earnings. Sales have also accelerated from 2% growth in the second quarter to 23% growth in the third.

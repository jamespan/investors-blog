**Freshworks** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the newly public company hits a buy point ahead of its third-quarter earnings report next week. FRSH stock surged on Friday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), FRSH stock jumped 8.3% to close at 50.25. Earlier in the session, it broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 49.35, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) extends to 51.82.


However, IPOs can be risky. So, investors should start with a small position, based on [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/). If the breakout fails and FRSH stock falls 7% to 8% below the buy point, investors should cut their losses. That [stop-loss sell zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) starts at 45.90.


The San Mateo, Calif.-based company [went public on Sept. 22](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/freshworks-ipo-near-10-billlion-dollar-valuation/) with its initial public offering priced at $36 a share.

FRSH Stock Gets Mostly Buy Ratings
----------------------------------


Freshworks offers a customer engagement platform via software-as-a-service. It has more than 50,000 customers, including Bridgestone, DeliveryHero, OfficeMax, TaylorMade and Vice Media.


Freshworks will post its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company late Tuesday. Analysts predict Freshworks will lose 14 cents a share on sales of $90.8 million in the third quarter, according to FactSet.


Last week, at least 13 Wall Street firms initiated coverage of FRSH stock. Of those, eight rate Freshworks as a buy and five are neutral.


Baird analyst Rob Oliver started Freshworks with an outperform rating and price target of 50.


"Freshworks' platform enables customers to achieve enterprise-grade experiences without the cost and complexity of a traditional enterprise solution," Oliver said. "With a large, underserved market, product-led-growth, and strong founder-led management, we believe Freshworks is atop the leaderboard setting the pace in the race toward a $120 billion total addressable market."


Relative Strength Line Hits Fresh High
--------------------------------------


In a bullish sign, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for FRSH stock is hitting new highs as it outperforms the S&P 500 index. This outperformance is highlighted with a [blue dot on MarketSmith charts](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-bluedot&src=A012CF3).


IBD's enterprise software stock group, which includes Freshworks, has been a top performer lately. It currently ranks No. 16 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.

JBHT stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the trucking company breaks out amid a key new partnership and expectations for solid profit growth.




**J.B. Hunt Transport Services** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) and several other shipping firms — including **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) and **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) — are faring well amid supply-chain challenges.


Intermodal Partner: Warren Buffett's BNSF
-----------------------------------------


On Wednesday, J.B. Hunt Transport and BNSF Railway Co. announced they will jointly work to improve intermodal capacity. Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) conglomerate owns BNSF. The companies cited growing demand for intermodal services, as companies look to reduce costs and their carbon footprint.


Intermodal transport uses several modes such as shipping, road and rail. It's seen as more efficient to get freight off trucks on highways and onto railroads. [J.B. Hunt is the largest intermodal shipping company](https://www.investors.com/news/esg-investing-role-model-transportation-hunt/) in the country.


On Jan. 19, J.B. Hunt Transport beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates despite Covid-related challenges. The company announced earlier in January that it will partner with Waymo, a unit of **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), on autonomous freight trucks or robot trucks.

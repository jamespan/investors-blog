**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Costco stock is nearing yet another buy point after forming a rare, powerful pattern. Several other discounters large and small also are faring well, including **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)).




Costco stock has a new, short consolidation as part of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). The [CAN SLIM cognoscente](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) knows such bases are especially bullish in a stock market correction or choppy market. When a winning stock can continue to step higher when the overall market is not, it's a good sign that it can stage a strong rally when the market resumes a solid uptrend. With [the previous pressure on the market subsiding](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-surprising-gains-market-outlook-shifts/), it is a good time for investors to look at new opportunities.


Costco Stock Analysis
---------------------


Shares fell 0.6% to 301.08 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It has now formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a [307.44 buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Because its base-on-base formation is part of the same pattern as its previous base, it also counts as a second-stage base. [IBD research shows earlier-stage bases are more likely to succeed than later-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).

Costco stock found support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) at the start of the month, right around its prior buy point, before rebounding from that key level following earnings on Oct. 3.


Another bullish indicator for Costco stock is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/). The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is around record highs, trending higher since the beginning of March.


The [Stock Checkup Tool is flashing a number of green lights](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-costco-wholesale-corp-cost.aspx) for Costco stock. It currently has a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating of 96](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). In addition it has a [strong, but not ideal, EPS Rating of 85](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), while its Relative Strength Rating is 92.



Costco Earnings
---------------


Over the past three quarters, Costco earnings have grown by an average of 22%, which is just short of the [25% benchmark for CAN SLIM stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). But after a 42% spike, Costco earnings growth cooled to 11% and 14% in the last two quarters.


Analysts see Costco earnings rising just 5% in fiscal 2020 and 8% in 2021.


Membership fees account for essentially all of Costco's earnings, with the warehouse chain breaking even on actual sales. So Costco focuses on increasing its customer base. Members benefit from Costco's low prices on key items that other retailers cannot compete with. One example for Costco is its rotisserie chickens, which analysts say they make almost nothing on, but which Costco believes drive foot traffic.


Costco focuses on providing premium items at the best-possible prices. The firm recently opened a poultry-processing plant in Freemont, Nebraska. It hatched the scheme so it can have total control over its supply chain of chicken.


Costco Stock A Leader In Hot Sector
-----------------------------------


Coscto stock is ranked No. 2 in the Retail-Major Discount Chains group, which is No. 6 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. Target stock, No. 1 in the group, cleared a short consolidation recently after skyrocketing in late August on strong earnings. No. 3 Walmart stock is in buy range from an early September breakout. Walmart competes directly with Costco via its Sam's Club chain.


Dollar stores and other smaller specialty discounters also are doing well. Dollar Tree stock remains in a buy zone.


China Demand Fuels Costco Stock Optimism
----------------------------------------


A key reason why there is renewed optimism for Costco stock is it just starting to tap a Chinese market that could be a huge growth driver for years to come. This has helped it rebound strongly after slumping in 2015-16


Management said in its earnings call earlier this month it has already seen record sign-ups of more than 200,000 memberships in China. That's at the one store it's opened there so far, fees that provide a key source of income. This compares with a worldwide average of 68,000 additions for both a mature and a new club.


Meanwhile, sales have "remained very strong" since the Shanghai store opened, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said, adding that the next opening is planned for "early 2021." It will also be in Shanghai, in the area of Pudong.


"Clearly, (the opening) surpassed all of our very high expectations," Galanti said.


But just because there is a huge opportunity, it does not mean Costco is going to be lax on its fiscal discipline. Management said it is going to "be pretty methodical" as it capitalizes on Chinese demand for its stores.


This bright spot overshadowed [mixed results earlier this month for the discounting behemoth](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-earnings-q4-2019-due-costco-stock-in-buy-zone/). Costco earnings per share of $2.69 beat views, after excluding 22 cents per share in expenses related to a product tax assessment. But the company missed some sales estimates.

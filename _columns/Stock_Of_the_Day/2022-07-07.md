The subcontractor giant recently announced a Renewable Energy segment, which includes services for solar and wind projects. Its other segments include Electric Power (59% of revenue) and Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (27%).


This sets the company up to take better advantage of the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Joe Biden in November 2021. That legislation includes $65 billion to upgrade the electric grid, including solar and wind expansion. It also includes $7.5 billion to build charging stations for electric vehicles.


Analysts predict PWR's EPS to rise by 28% in 2022 and by 10% in 2023, according to FactSet.


PWR Stock
---------


Quanta rose 4.7% to 132.25 at the close of Thursday's [market trading,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-indexes-see-more-green-health-care-stocks-hit-buy-points/) amid a 44% decrease in volume. PWR is above its 50-day moving average as it forms a somewhat awkward [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) pattern with a 138.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


The stock appears to be moving above short-term resistance within the handle. This sets up an aggressive early entry around 130. PWR stock's relative strength line is also at a new high.



It's a first-stage pattern, which [IBD research shows](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) is more likely to succeed. However, June was sporadic for PWR; overhead supply appears quite thick from the 125 through 138 price levels, [according to IBD Leaderboard analysis](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders).


Institutional investors increased by 3% from March to June and the stock has a D+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/), which shows minuscule improvement. Stocks with greatest reported accumulation earn A ratings. Letter grades of D or E show indicate net selling among large investors, and generally should be avoided.


Another potential concern is that other heavy construction stocks have faltered in recent months. These include **KBR** ([KBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBR)), **Jacobs Engineering** ([J](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=J)) and **Aecom Technology** ([ACM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACM)).


PWR stock has a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) of 99. It has a 96 Relative Strength Rating, an exclusive [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-quanta-services-inc-pwr.aspx) gauge for share price movement with a 1 to 99 score. The rating shows how a stock's performance over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in IBD's database. The EPS rating is 97.

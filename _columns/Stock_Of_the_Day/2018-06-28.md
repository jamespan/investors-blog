Growth In Digital, Cloud Services

"Accenture continues to trade at a premium to peers but we believe a better multiple is warranted based on exposure to digital and cloud growth, strong free cash flow conversion, earnings quality above the peer group, and support as a defensive stock as we enter the later stages of an economic expansion cycle," said Brian Essex, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report.


Accenture said adjusted earnings rose 18% to $1.79 a share, with revenue rising 16% vs. a year earlier to $10.3 billion. Analysts expected Accenture to report earnings of $1.72 a share on sales of $10.04 billion for the period ended April 30.


"Accenture continues to benefit from demand uptick for digital/SMAC (social, mobile, analytics and cloud), which now accounts for roughly 60% of revenue," said Moshe Katri, a Wedbush analyst in a report.


For the current fiscal fourth quarter, Accenture [forecast revenue in a range](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2018-results.htm) of $9.8 billion to $10.05 billion, roughly in-line with estimates of $10.01 billion.


Accenture Margins An Issue
--------------------------


Shares in the global tech consulting and services firm took a hit in March when it reported fiscal Q2 earnings. Operating margins disappointed due to contract renewals in the health care and public services markets. Accenture garners about 20% of revenue from communications and media customers, 20% from financial services, and 17% from health care and public services.


Analysts expect margin expansion in the second half of 2018. "We continue to see evidence of a strong IT spending environment," said Morgan Stanley's Essex in the report. "Recent peer (competitors) and consultant commentary has also been constructive around spending with favorable spending trends in digital, cloud services, manufacturing, insurance, and health care."

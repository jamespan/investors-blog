**O'Reilly Auto Parts** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), reclaiming a key technical level Thursday as shares set a new relative strength high in a bullish base near a buy point. O'Reilly stock and other auto parts retailers offer growth but also a defensive safe haven in a stock market correction.




O'Reilly Auto Parts, a leading specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket supplies and tools, serves both the individual or do-it-yourself (DIY) and commercial or do-it-for-me (DIFM) customer.


Analysts say O'Reilly's dual-market approach is the best developed among national auto parts retailers. Peers include **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)). **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)), currently ranked highest by IBD in this industry group, also serves both the auto and industrial parts markets.


Auto parts retailers benefit from the rising number of miles driven in the U.S. and increasing age of vehicles on the road. And as a global economic slowdown emerges, consumers are seen fixing up their existing cars rather than buying new cars. That helps to explain why auto parts companies have won favor of late.

O'Reilly Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


O'Reilly stock popped 1.5% to 346.13 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), moving back above its 50-day moving average, a key support level. Shares have formed a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) with a potential 363.60 buy point. The base-on-base pattern signals unusual strength in a stock market correction or bear market. A stock holding its ground and stepping modestly higher despite the weak market stands out.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, rose to a fresh high Thursday. 


O'Reilly stock also is on the [Stock Spotlight screen](https://research.beta.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/).


In November, Missouri-based O'Reilly Auto Parts boosted its share repurchase program by $1 billion. That took the total buyback authorization since the program began in January 2011 to $11.75 billion. O'Reilly stock has a market cap of nearly $28 billion.


Among other auto parts retailers, AutoZone stock rose 0.85%, holding above its 50-day line and close to its December peak. Advance Auto Parts stock jumped 3.1%, working on its fourth straight advance and nearing its 50-day line. Advance Auto Parts and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) recently agreed to form an online joint venture.


Genuine Parts stock fell 1.6% after undercutting its 200-day line Wednesday.


Investors should largely avoid new buys. While a stock market rally attempt continues despite Thursday's sell-off, there's been no [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). For now it's still a stock market correction. Also, O'Reilly stock and its peers may be holding up well in the stock market correction, but it's not clear if they'll be huge leaders in the next confirmed uptrend.


IBD Stock Of The Day: O'Reilly Earnings Strong
----------------------------------------------


O'Reilly stock rates well on both technical and fundamental metrics, leading to an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. It scores an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 96, but sales growth has been less than stellar and bears watching.


O'Reilly earnings growth averaged 18% over the past three years, falling short of a key [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) requirement. O'Reilly earnings rose 41% and 40% in the last two quarters, with analysts expecting a 29% Q4 gain and 11% in 2019.


On Feb. 6, O'Reilly earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter are due.


Sales growth has been less impressive, with single-digit gains for the past 10 quarters.


O'Reilly added 171 stores in the first nine months of 2018, taking its total to 5,190 stores across 47 states. The company targeted 200 net new stores for all of 2018 and plans to add 200-210 for 2019. As it beefs up its nationwide presence, O'Reilly should meaningfully increase market share in both the DIY and commercial segments, analysts say.


O'Reilly's ability to quickly and reliably source hard-to-find auto parts for commercial customers gives it an edge over smaller and regional rivals, according to Morningstar equity analyst Zain Akbari.

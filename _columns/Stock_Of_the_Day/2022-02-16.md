**Oneok** ([OKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The natural gas company is in a consolidation as natgas prices soar on mixed messages between Russia and the West.




Gas soared 9.5% Wednesday as energy traders eyed what the U.S. estimates to be 150,000 Russian troops deployed near the Ukraine border. Russia claims to have withdrawn some troops from the border and from Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Meanwhile, officials from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization say Russia continues to increases its number of troops near the border.


The uneasy situation has energy markets on edge. Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russia. About a quarter of that gas travels via pipelines routed through Ukraine. Analysts worry that an invasion of Ukraine could potentially upend European energy markets.


While there is only a very small link between U.S. natural gas and Europe's markets, through [liquefied natural gas](https://www.investors.com/news/lng-liquefied-natural-gas-europe-energy-search-russia-ukraine/), the uncertainty has boosted oil prices, global natural gas prices and U.S. natgas stocks, like Oneok.


Oneok is an Oklahoma-based pipeline company that collects, processes and distributes natural gas. It has operations throughout the Williston, Powder River and Permian basins.


The company is the No.1 stock in [IBD's highly ranked Oil & Gas-Transportation and Pipeline industry group.](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-feb-15-2022/) The group also includes **Plains All American Pipeline** ([PAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAA)) and liquefied natural gas shipping company **Flex LNG** ([FLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLNG)).


OKE Stock Near Two Possible Entry Points
----------------------------------------


Shares rose 0.4% to 62.65 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). OKE stock started the day in a consolidation with a 66.88 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. But the stock put the final touches on a handle, lowering the base's buy point to 64.90.


The stock is testing support at its short-term [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and is well above its 50-day line of support. Oneok's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is near new highs. The RS line compares a stock's performance with that of the S&P 500. When the RS line is climbing, this means the stock is outperforming the benchmark index.

------------------

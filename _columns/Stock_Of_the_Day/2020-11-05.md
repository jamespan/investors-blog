**Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) is the IBD Stock of the Day after crushing Q3 earnings estimates as "accelerating interest" in active lifestyles during the pandemic fueled its premium outdoor products business. Yeti stock broke out but is already extended.




Yeti Earnings, Outlook
----------------------


Profit soared 126% to 61 cents per share, smashing views for 37 cents. Revenue rose 29% to $294.61 million and also beat views for $264.73 million. That marked a big acceleration from the prior quarter, when Yeti earnings grew 37% on a 7% sales gain.


Coolers and Drinkware drove results, up 27% and 31% respectively. Yeti cited "continued strong demand for outdoor recreation and leisure lifestyle products and an increasing shift to online shopping," as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.


Margins expanded 670 basis points due to a favorable shift in sales mix, led by a 62% jump in direct-to-consumer sales. Cash increased to $234.8 million vs $34.6 million a year ago. The company paid down $50 million of debt.


"We are now focused on continuing the momentum through the 2020 holidays and into 2021 as we build supply to meet demand across our omnichannel," CEO Matt Reintjes said in a statement.


Citing pandemic uncertainty, Yeti provided a limited but slightly bullish outlook. It expects sales to increase 15%-16% in Q4. It foresees EPS of 55-58 cents. At the midpoint, both ranges are slightly above Wall Street's expectations. Analysts were expecting Q4 Yeti earnings per share of 55 cents with sales up 14.4%.

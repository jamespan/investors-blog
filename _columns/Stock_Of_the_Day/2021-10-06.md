Acuity Brands stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares broke out on Wednesday, after the maker of lighting fixtures and controls in buildings reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations.




The results were aided by a recovery in the construction market, parts of which were halted last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. But analysts remained concerned about hiccups in the global supply chain.


Acuity Brands Stock
-------------------


**Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) stock jumped 11% to 195.32 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). That's above a 194.69 entry of a consolidation. AYI stock closed well off intraday highs of 204, which is not a great sign, especially given the overall market's strong close.


The advance for Acuity Brands stock on Wednesday also pulled the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) up sharply, almost to a new high.

The world's supply chain has suffered from pandemic restrictions at factories, a lack of available labor and backups at ports and warehouses, pushing shipping costs upward. Some analysts who cover Acuity Brands stock raised concerns for the road ahead.


"Given lighting is one of the last elements in construction, overall delays impact lighting more," William Blair analysts said in a research note ahead of Acuity's earnings.

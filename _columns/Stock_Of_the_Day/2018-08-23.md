The small cap marketing and media company, a turnaround story, is delivering strong growth.

QuinStreet Earnings Win Over Wall Street
----------------------------------------


Earlier this month, the IBD Stock of the Day reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue above analyst estimates. QuinStreet earnings rose 117% vs. a year earlier. Revenue grew 37%, though that ended a four-quarter string of accelerating sales growth.


The Foster City, Calif. company is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Commercial Services-Advertising Group. QuinStreet has a 92 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). That means it has outperformed 92% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, cleared the consolidation's peak along with QuinStreet stock.


QuinStreet stock debuted in February 2010 and quickly formed an IPO base.


But the company came under fire in 2013, after Attorneys General for 15 states investigated the company for misleading military veterans with deceptive marketing practices for its for-profit colleges customers. QuinStreet settled for $2.3 million and had to hand its GIBill.com site over to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

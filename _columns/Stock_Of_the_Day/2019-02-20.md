**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) stock climbed back into record high territory on Wednesday after stumbling for more than a year over its failed takeover bid for **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)). Investors are driving Broadcom stock higher ahead of the chipmaker's fiscal first-quarter earnings report, due March 14.




Broadcom stock rose 0.6% to 283.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Earlier in the session, it reached a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of 285.78. Broadcom stock had been [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) for 65 weeks.


In a bullish sign, Broadcom's relative strength line has been drawing new highs. Broadcom stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks over the past 12 months.


In intraday trading, Broadcom stock touched a record high of 286.62. That's its highest level since late November 2017. At the time, it was pursuing a hostile takeover of wireless chipmaker Qualcomm.

Broadcom stock has been supported by rising institutional buying as well as the company's robust share buyback program.


Broadcom Stock Surges Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------------------


President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's proposed acquisition of Qualcomm in [March 2018](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/whats-next-for-broadcom-now-that-trumps-nixed-qualcomm-buy/) on national security grounds. At the time, Broadcom was headquartered in Singapore. It later moved its headquarters to San Jose, Calif.


Broadcom makes chips for wired and wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial markets. With its recent purchase of CA Technologies, it aspires to be a [provider of diversified information-technology infrastructure](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/broadcom-stock-called-top-pick-2019/).


Declining sales and production of smartphones, including **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone handsets, have pinched Broadcom's wireless chip business in recent quarters.


First-Quarter Results Seen Marking Bottom
-----------------------------------------


Broadcom will report its [fiscal first-quarter results](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/financial-releases/2387502) after the market close on March 14. Analysts expect the company to earn $5.22 a share on sales of $5.74 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Those targets translate to year-over-year growth of 2% in earnings per share and 8% in sales.


Broadcom's fiscal first-quarter results are likely to be a low-water mark for the company. The forecast for single-digit growth is a far cry from its usual double digits.


But analysts predict that the company's sales and earnings will accelerate over the next couple of quarters.


For the second quarter, Wall Street is modeling earnings to rise 8% and sales to increase 15% year over year. For the third quarter, analysts expect earnings to pop 16% and sales to jump 19%, Zacks said.

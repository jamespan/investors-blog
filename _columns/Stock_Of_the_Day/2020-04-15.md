Zscaler Stock Bounces Back From Late 2019 Slide
-----------------------------------------------


Before the coronavirus outbreak, Zscaler stock edged up in early 2020 on views that a new chief marketing officer could revive sales growth. Then the coronavirus outbreak hit.


With Wednesday's gain, Zscaler stock has shot up some 46% in 2020 while many cybersecurity stocks have plunged the last three months.


Zscaler owns a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.


Meanwhile, the relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. An [upward-trending RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


Zscaler's cloud-based service offers companies a new way to support remote workers.


Many companies have deployed virtual private networks since the early 2000s. VPNs enable employees working from home to access internal computer systems. Cybersecurity firms that sell firewall network technology sell products designed to make VPNs safer.


Zscaler Private Access Replaces VPN Solutions
---------------------------------------------


However, the Zscaler Private Access, or ZPA cloud service, replaces VPNs.


UBS analyst Fatima Boolani, in a recent report, said: "The overnight need for secure and compliant third-party access over the public internet is challenging traditional VPN/firewall enforced access routed through corporate data centers."


She added: "That's where Zscaler's technical and elastic scale competitively shines."


Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Zscaler says many existing customers have increased usage of its security network to support remote workers. In a recent blog, the company said "since January, Zscaler Private Access has experienced traffic increases exceeding 10X."


Zscaler Stock: Revenue Comes From Older Products
------------------------------------------------


At Morgan Stanley, analyst Melissa Franchi is cautious over the near-term boost Zscaler might get as companies cope with the coronavirus emergency.


She noted in a report that Zscaler still gets most revenue from an older product. Zscaler Internet Access, or ZIA, is a cloud-based replacement for on-premise web security gateways.


"We see risk to Zscaler in 2020, with the majority of its businesses focused on transitioning customers from on-premise security to a cloud-based architecture, which requires a major overhaul."


She added: "This risk outweighs any tailwinds to its remote access solution, ZPA, which is a much smaller percentage of its business and is currently heavily discounted (largely free)."


Zscaler spokesperson Tom Stilwell in an email told IBD that in Zscaler's past earnings reports the company has reported that security gateway products such as ZIA have accounted for about 90% of revenue.


Work From Home, Less Small Business Exposure
--------------------------------------------


The corporate shift to work-at-home arrangements has been one driver of Zscaler stock recent outperformance. In addition, the company has less exposure to small business than some cybersecurity firms. The coronavirus pandemic has forced many small businesses to shut down entirely.


As part of a subscription-based business model, Zscaler's recurring revenue as a percentage of total sales also is higher than cybersecurity companies founded before the cloud computing era. Some investors prefer companies with high recurring revenue in the current economic environment. That's because new contracts may be delayed as business travel slows.


Zscaler's moves made it a [recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cybersecurity-firm-zscaler-stock-gains-work-from-home/). **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), also a recent IBD Stock of the Day, is another cybersecurity stock with high recurring revenue.

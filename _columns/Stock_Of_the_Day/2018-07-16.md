**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as shares of the specialty discount chain — and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) member — form another base, albeit a late-stage one.




The company has 630 stores across 32 states in the U.S., and plans to open 125 more this year. Its primary fare includes cellphone cases, graphic T-shirts, school supplies and seasonal products, all for five bucks or less. The preteen and teenage crowd is its main audience: Think $1 avocado-shaped erasers, $5 bluetooth portable speakers, and $4 jumbo-size plastic cups shaped like ice cream cones.


Five Below Earnings
-------------------


Five Below stock spiked nearly 22% in early June on the back of solid first-quarter results that beat expectations. [Profit more than doubled](https://www.investors.com/news/five-below-q1-earnings-stock-buy-zone/) to 35 cents a share and revenue grew 27% to $296 million. Same-store sales rose 3.2%, slightly missing the consensus.


Management offered above-consensus Q2 and full-year guidance, and CEO Joel Anderson said then that the company's performance "continues to reinforce our confidence in the 2,500-plus nationwide store opportunity we see for Five Below."

Five Below Stock
----------------


Shares have been trading sideways since that massive pop, forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 104.09 entry point. Five Below stock rose 2% to close at 103.43 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) and is up 56% so far in calendar 2018.


Five Below's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, hit an all-time high in late June and remains near that level.



Be aware that Five Below is forming a [late-stage base](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/late--stage-base): one that follows a series of technical breakouts from previous bases. This 2013 [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/late-stage-base-should-be-avoided/) advises investors to avoid late-stage bases, since "the odds of winning a substantial profit shrink considerably."


Still, **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) in January offered an example of a [late-stage pattern that was still performing well](https://www.investors.com/videos/heres-an-example-of-a-late-stage-base-thats-still-doing-well/).


Good Year For Retail Sector Stocks
----------------------------------


Discounters and off-price stores have been in the spotlight lately. **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and T.J. Maxx parent **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) are recent Stock Of The Day headliners, as retailers broadly appear to be having a better-than-expected year.


**Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) is another discount chain that's forming a flat base after finding strength in a [recent earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/ollies-bargain-outlet-reports-earnings/).


Dollar General stock retreated 0.4%. TJX stock dipped 0.1% and has been consolidating for the last few weeks. Ollie's Bargain Outlet stock fell 3%, testing its 50-day moving average.


Amazon Stock Hits New High
--------------------------


Meanwhile, the retailer to beat — e-commerce leader **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) — [hit a record high](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/amazon-prime-day-financial-stocks/) Monday as shoppers anticipate its annual [Prime Day sales event](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-prime-day-deals/). Amazon Prime Day, which is 36 hours this year, starts at noon PT today and runs through Tuesday.


Amazon stock rose 0.4% intraday.

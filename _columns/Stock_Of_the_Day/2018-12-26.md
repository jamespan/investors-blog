**Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Deckers stock is in a bullish pattern in a bear market. Ugg parent Deckers jumped above a key technical level in Wednesday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). And Deckers stock boasts record-high relative strength.




Deckers Outdoor is best known for its wildly popular Ugg product line, which generates around 85% of sales. However, the sheepskin Ugg boots are highly seasonal. The apparel maker and retailer has been making strides to diversify. It already owns the popular Teva brand, and has also broadened its offerings with their Hoka One One running shoes.


Deckers Stock Technical Analysis
--------------------------------


Deckers stock shot up 9.5% to 130.63 in Wednesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The broader indexes rebounded strongly after the S&P 500 index entered a bear market on Christmas Eve. Deckers stock moved back above its 50-day moving average, a key technical benchmark that often acts as a support for top stocks.


Deckers stock has formed a seven-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 137.59 buy point, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The pattern formed after Deckers stock rallied to record highs following strong earnings on Oct. 25. A flat base in a down market is very bullish. With a flat base, a stock is showing it doesn't want to give up ground despite market head winds.



That Deckers stock outperformance shows up in the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which is at a record high.

Deckers stock was added to IBD's [Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/) on Wednesday.


Deckers stock price is up 63% in 2018.


Watch Deckers Stock, But It's Not A Buy Now
-------------------------------------------


Despite the bullish signals for Deckers stock, it's not at a proper buy point. More important, the stock market correction — a bear market for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 index — is a giant warning to avoid new purchases


Deckers Earnings Solid, But Seasonal
------------------------------------


Earnings growth is a key part of the [CAN SLIM investment formula](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). The latest IBD Stock of the Day has delivered some impressive results, though they tend to be spotty due to the seasonal nature of the business. In the most recent quarter, Deckers earnings shot up 55%. That did follow a quarterly loss, though that narrowed vs. a year earlier. Deckers' earnings-per-share growth rate of 15% does not quite pass muster. IBD founder [William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) recommends looking for annual earnings to increase by 25% or more.


Deckers Outdoor is heavily reliant on strong sales of its Ugg line of winter boots. And it could be set for a bumper festive season, as holiday retail sales grew at their fastest pace in six years to top $850 billion, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse data. Apparel sales rose at their best rate in eight years.


Management has upped its outlook for fiscal 2019, projecting net sales of $1.935 billion to $1.960 billion, up from $1.930 billion to $1.955 billion. Meanwhile, Deckers sees EPS hitting $6.65-$6.85 per share, up from the $5.74 reported in fiscal 2018.


Deckers stock boasts excellent fundamentals, which are reflected in its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 95.


The company is the top-rated stock in the [Apparel-Shoes & Related industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-24-2018/). Other stocks in the group include sports behemoth **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) as well as shoemakers **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)).

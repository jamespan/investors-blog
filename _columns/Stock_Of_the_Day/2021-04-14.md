**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the investment bank flashes bullish indicators after a blowout earnings report. Goldman Sachs stock is also forming a new base.




Market Bonanza Lifts Earnings
-----------------------------


EPS soared about 500% to $18.60, nearly doubling Wall Street forecasts. Revenue shot up 102.5% to $17.7 billion, easily beating views for $11.5 billion.


The quarter coincided with market trends that fed directly into Goldman Sachs' wheelhouse.


The Reddit-fueled short squeeze drove big swings in stocks and equity-trading desks. The spike in Treasury yields added to the market volatility, further lifting trades. And the continued boom in new stock listings via special purpose acquisition company mergers aided the investment bank's underwriting business.


Goldman Sachs' investment banking revenue surged 73% to a record high $3.77 billion. Fixed-income trading revenue jumped 31% to $3.89 billion, and equities trading revenue surged 68% to $3.69 billion.


Asset management revenue shot up $4.61 billion compared with a negative $96 million a year ago. Wealth management revenue climbed 16% to $1.74 billion. Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $70 million, vs. net provisions of $937 million a year ago.


CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon reiterated strong buy and 395 price target on Goldman Sachs stock but said the bank is "executing on all cylinders."


He added that capital markets will remain very active in a low rate, risk-on environment from corporate issuers, mergers and acquisitions, and investors.


"We see the next major catalyst coming from buybacks and dividend hikes when the Fed's stress test results are released by July 1," Leon said in a note to clients.

Tempur Sealy Stock
------------------


Shares rose 4% to 82.65 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), clearing a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with an 81.95 buy point. Tempur Sealy hit its highest level since its record April 2012 peak of 87.43. Breakout volume for Tempur Sealy was strong, signaling institutional buying. The flat-base consolidation began in July, a few days after the second-quarter Tempur Sealy earnings report.


After weaving above and below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), Tempur Sealy stock cleared that key level last week and has continued to advance. With Temper Sealy stock rising for seven straight sessions, shares could be at risk of a modest pullback.

Tempur Sealy Earnings
---------------------


Temper Sealy earnings growth has accelerated over the past three quarter. Sales growth has improved for six straight quarters, from -18% to +10%. Analysts expect Tempur Sealy earnings growth, however, to take a breather over the next two quarters. But after 19% EPS growth in 2019, Wall Street sees Tempur Sealy earnings growth accelerating to 50% in 2020.


Tempur Sealy reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 31.


For the second quarter, the company said demand for Tempur's new Breeze line of mattresses, designed to maintain a cooler temperature than a standard mattress, helped propel its North American business.


Net sales in Tempur Sealy's North American business rose 11.4% during the second quarter, below some expectations. International sales grew 2%.


"Perhaps the biggest positive inflection this quarter was Sealy's return to growth within the challenging sub-$1,000 price point," CEO Scott Thompson said during the Tempur Sealy earnings conference call in July.


He cited new lines of distribution and "recent favorable tariff rulings."


"We believe this momentum will continue," he added.


Tempur Sealy stock has a strong 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measures a company's ability to accelerate profit, is 82.

Mattress Competition
--------------------


The company is known for its Posture-Pedic back-support mattresses, along with its Sealy and Tempur-Pedic bedding lines.


The gains for Tempur Sealy come as a still-solid economy props up the housing market, potentially aiding demand for home furnishings.


Competition in the mattress business, however, isn't easy. The pillow industry, Tempur Sealy notes in its most recent annual report, "is characterized by a large number of competitors, none of which is dominant."


Tempur Sealy in June also said it entered into a new supply agreement with retailer Mattress Firm. The move marked a reconciliation after a bitter separation between the two in January 2017.


At that time, Tempur Sealy said the mattress retailer threatened to terminate their contracts in the U.S. unless it agreed to "significant economic concessions" and other changes. The two companies were unable to work out a new deal, and Tempur Sealy said it would stop doing business with Mattress Firm.


The acrimony eventually made its way to court last year, when Tempur Sealy alleged that Mattress Firm was selling copycat mattresses. In 2016, Mattress Firm was Tempur Sealy's biggest customer.


Tempur Sealy sells products in more than 100 countries. It got around 29% of its net sales from outside the U.S. last year.


Other Sleep Stocks Revitalized
------------------------------


The Household/Office Furniture industry is ranked No. 50 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Tempur Sealy stock is rated No. 1 within that group.


The Retail-Home Furnishings industry group, which contains names like **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Williams Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), currently holds the top spot among 197 groups that IBD tracks. RH is No. 1 in the group, according to [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-r-h-rh.aspx).


That group also includes **Sleep Number** ([SNBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNBR)), a highly rated company that develops smart beds loaded with sleep-tracking technology. [Sleep Number stock jumped](https://www.investors.com/news/snbr-stock-sleep-number-earnings-q3-2019-tempur-sealy-buy-point/) on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter results that beat estimates.


Sleep Number stock is in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 52.18 buy point.

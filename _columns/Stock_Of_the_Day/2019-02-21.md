**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of computer-aided design, or CAD, software is expanding its horizons and expected to post another quarter of triple-digit earnings growth next week.




Analysts expect Autodesk to earn 42 cents a share on sales of $707 million in the quarter ended Jan. 31. In the year-earlier quarter, Autodesk lost 9 cents a share on sales of $554 million. On an absolute-value basis, per-share earnings should grow 567%. Revenue is seen rising 28% from a year ago.


Autodesk is [expanding beyond its CAD software base](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/autodesk-stock-construction-industry/) to add more software and services for managing workflows. Lately it has focused on the construction industry. In January, it bought BuildingConnected, a leading preconstruction platform. In December, it purchased PlanGrid, a leading provider of construction productivity software.


Autodesk stock is trading just below its all-time high of 161.51, reached last Friday. The stock touched a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of 160.04 on Feb. 13, but didn't advance much into the buy zone. It had been [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) for 24 weeks.

Autodesk Stock: Earnings Report On Deck
---------------------------------------


The San Rafael, Calif.-based company will report [fiscal fourth-quarter earnings](http://investors.autodesk.com/) after the market close on Feb. 28. However, investors should always be [cautious ahead of earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/should-you-buy-stock-ahead-of-earnings/).


Still, earnings are expected to accelerate. For its fiscal first quarter, Wall Street expects Autodesk earnings of 57 cents a share on revenue of $723.8 million. That compares with year-earlier results of 6 cents in per-share earnings and $559.9 million in sales.


Autodesk's sales and earnings have improved markedly since the company completed its transition to a software-as-a-service business. The cloud computing business model affords a more predictable and stable revenue stream with the opportunity to generate more revenue from customers over time.

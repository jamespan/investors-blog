**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The coffee chain continues to hang in a buy zone as the current stock market pulls back. Starbucks stock has been outperforming the S&P 500 index for several weeks. Other restaurant stocks acting well include **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)).




Coffee giant Starbucks runs more than 29,000 stores across the globe. Starbucks earnings showed strength in January on the back of same-store sales growth worldwide. While growth in a slowing China is being closely watched, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson remains bullish on the market, one of the chain's largest.


In terms of the [top stock-picking criteria that matter most to smart investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), Starbucks stock comes off well.


**Starbucks**Stock Technical Analysis
-------------------------------------


Shares of Starbucks dipped 0.9% to 70.61 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), still above a 69.08 buy point. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/) stock broke out from a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) formation weeks ago.



Starbucks stock previously broke out of a long consolidation on an [earnings gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) Nov. 2, [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows.


Meanwhile, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is holding at highs, trending higher since late January. The RS line, tracking a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is shown in blue in the chart above. It's an easy way to tell if a stock is a leader or laggard, in good markets or bad.


Starbucks stock also has [traded tightly the past three weeks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), a bullish sign that could foretell a solid price run and new highs.


Still, while Starbucks stock is acting well, investors should recognize that the current stock market is having a pullback. So far the action has been normal, but even top stocks tend to follow the market direction.

Chipotle stock dipped 0.7% to 609.37, slightly extended from an earnings gap entry of 568.42. Chipotle is an IBD Leaderboard stock.


Yum Brands stock fell 0.1% to 96.54, but it's in range from a 94.23 entry. Yum Brands is the parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut.


Stock Of The Day Fundamentals Are Solid
---------------------------------------


Starbucks stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 94. That means it's outperforming 94% of all stocks in terms of the most important technical and fundamental characteristics. Look for that metric to hit 95. Top stocks often have a CR of 95 or more at the start of their biggest runs.


Starbucks holds a solid-but-not-superior [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 84. Earnings grew 13% on average over the past three quarters. Analysts call for 12% EPS growth in 2019 as well as 2020.


Companies with slower earnings growth are likely to see slower share price gains than younger, fast-growing firms.


Starbucks Earnings, Initiatives
-------------------------------


Starbucks earnings benefited from multiple initiatives in the U.S., including loyalty programs and digital/mobile offerings.


Its new partnership in China with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and a licensing deal with Nestle have boosted hopes for international growth.

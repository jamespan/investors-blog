'Exceeded Our Expectations'
---------------------------


Skechers has made a name for itself making comfort footwear. It helped popularize the bulked-up "dad sneakers" that dominated the 1990s and received a high-fashion reinterpretation more recently.


For the second quarter, reported last month, Skechers put up sales of $1.66 billion. That represented a 127% jump year over year and a 31.7% increase over the period in 2019. The company during the quarter earned 88 cents per share.


Skechers reported those results even amid delayed shipments, backups at the ports, and temporary store closures in India, Canada, Europe and South America. The shoemaker also forecast third-quarter and full-year results that were above expectations.

"Given our global growth, we are confident that Skechers' innovative collection of comfort footwear and apparel (is) resonating with consumers as they began returning to work, dining out, shopping and traveling," COO David Weinberg said on Skechers' earnings call last month.


"Where markets were open and restrictions eased, sales exceeded our expectations," he continued.


'A More Relaxed Lifestyle'
--------------------------


Coronavirus cases have surged over the past month in the U.S., after the nation's vaccination drive sputtered. The economic impact is unclear. But Weinberg said that customers, amid the pandemic, had embraced "a more relaxed lifestyle and want to incorporate comfort into their work and weekend wear."


**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), in July, also reported second-quarter results that beat expectations. It also forecast third-quarter and full-year sales that were above estimates. Along with Skechers stock, CROX rose sharply on the report.


Skechers stock is a member of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing group, whose rank stands at No. 5 out of 197 groups tracked.

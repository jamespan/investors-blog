**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it sets a new buy point during the coronavirus stock market recovery. Adobe stock climbed higher on Friday.




The San Jose, Calif.-based company has a more resilient business model since it switched to software-as-a-service from licensed software sales. It offers digital media and marketing software and services on a subscription basis online.


Adobe stock hit an all-time high of 386.75 on Feb. 20 ahead of the stock market crash sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. It fell 34% from that high before beginning to recover. Over the past 10 weeks it has formed a cup base.


But a recent pullback in shares will give it a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 350.48 by Friday's regular session close, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Adobe stock rose 1.3%, near 339.80.

Adobe Creative Cloud Could Survive Zombie Apocalypse
----------------------------------------------------


Adobe has three cloud computing businesses. Its largest, Creative Cloud, includes software for creative professionals such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Document Cloud includes its Acrobat and e-signature offerings. Experience Cloud provides marketing software and services.


"Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions seem highly sticky as it would be the last thing our experts turn off in an extreme downturn," Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in an April 13 report after consulting with Creative Cloud users. "We believe the subscription model has made Adobe much more resilient than in past down cycles."


He added, "One expert said, 'I would keep (my) Adobe seat even if there were zombies roaming the earth.' Adobe is a mission-critical toolbox for designers and essential for their livelihood."


Thill rates Adobe stock as buy with a price target of 370.


Adobe has posted three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth. In its [fiscal first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-earnings-q1-2020-adbe-stock/) ended Feb. 28, Adobe earned an adjusted $2.27 a share on sales of $3.09 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Adobe earnings rose 33% while sales climbed 19%.


For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $2.35 a share on sales of $3.175 billion. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 28% in earnings and 16% in sales.

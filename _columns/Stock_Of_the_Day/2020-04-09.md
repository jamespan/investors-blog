**Sea Limited** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as this leading Southeast Asia provider of e-commerce and digital entertainment heads toward profitability and expands into other regions.




Sea stock displays the characteristics of one to watch for a potential breakout. The company is growing at a torrid pace, with triple-digit revenue growth over the past six quarters.


But it has yet to show a profit since its December 2017 initial public offering. That's largely due to it spending heavily to further its expansion and gain market share in Asia. It's not expected to reach profitability, on an adjusted basis, until 2021.


Still, Sea stock has surged more than 200% since its IPO. On the [stock market toda](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)y, Sea stock climbed above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), a bullish sign before ended the day below it. Shares slipped with a relative strength line that is indicating market leadership.

A Leader In Digital Entertainment
---------------------------------


Based in Singapore, Sea says it has both the largest digital entertainment platform and the largest e-commerce operation in the Southeast Asia region, comprised of Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. It's also expanding into new markets like India and Latin America.


Sea operates three business units: digital entertainment, e-commerce and, most recently, digital payment services.


The largest unit is digital entertainment. This unit showed fourth-quarter revenue doubling to $479.8 million from the year-ago period. It's also the company's only profitable unit. On the basis of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, it showed a profit of $266.4 million, up 153%.


Sea also operates one of the most popular online gaming platforms in the region, called Garena. Its services include online mobile games and esports. The company says its free mobile game called Free Fire, "recently joined the $1 billion club as one of the highest-grossing mobile games in the world."


Quarterly active users in the fourth quarter reached 354.7 million, an increase of 64% from the year-ago period. Paying users accounted for 9.4% of the total, up from 5.5%.


Free Fire was also the highest grossing mobile game in Latin America and in Southeast Asia in the fourth quarter, the company reports.


Jump In Revenue For E-Commerce
------------------------------


Sea's e-commerce business is called Shopee. This group reported a 182% jump in revenue to $358 million in the fourth quarter. But it had an adjusted EBITDA loss of $306.2 million. The loss was attributed to an increase in spending.


"We continued our investment to fully capture the market opportunity in the region," the company said in a financial statement. "We will continue to invest prudently and drive high quality growth by serving the users' needs better in the long run."


Gross merchandise value — the total of goods sold on its platform — climbed 65% to $5.6 billion.


For 2020, Sea currently expects adjusted revenue for e-commerce between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. It expects adjusted revenue for digital entertainment to be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. It did not provide guidance on profitability.


In the fourth quarter, the company introduced the creation of SeaMoney, its digital finance business unit.


Sea Stock: Revenue Jumps 134%
-----------------------------


Total adjusted revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 134% to $909 million. It reported an adjusted loss of 53 cents per share, vs. a 95-cent loss a year ago.


Cowen analyst John Blackledge doesn't think Sea will turn the corner on profitability until 2021. After that, though, he estimates the company's annual profits will grow sharply through 2024, when earnings will reach $5.12 a share. Blackledge has a rating of outperform on Sea stock and a price target of 55.


"We believe Sea's market leadership in both online mobile gaming and e-commerce in the rapidly growing Southeast Asian market should drive value creation over the long term," Blackledge said in a recent note to clients.


What makes Sea worthy of putting it on a list of the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) is its relative strength line, which is hovering around record territory. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.

It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 98 out of 99. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the past 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.

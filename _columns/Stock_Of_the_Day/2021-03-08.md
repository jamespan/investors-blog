**Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the maker of polymers and plastics surges amid an upswing in chemical production. WLK stock broke out.




Headquartered in Houston, Westlake is a global manufacturer and supplier of materials and products used in packaging, health care products, car parts and consumer goods, as well as building and construction products. 


The American Chemistry Council said U.S. chemical production grew for the seventh straight month in January. Chemical makers like Westlake supply materials to several key industries.


Last month, Westlake posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of 87 cents, a 47% increase from the year-ago quarter. It had revenue of $1.97 billion, a 4% increase from the prior year.


"Westlake had a strong finish to the year as we restarted all of our production in Lake Charles following two powerful hurricanes that hit Southwest Louisiana," said CEO Albert Chao in a statement. "With our operations restored in the middle of the fourth quarter, we were able to capitalize on the robust global demand and benefit from higher prices and margins for most of our products." 


Chao added he believes strength in global demand in polyethylene and PVC, coupled with the rise in housing starts and new building permits, will continue into 2021.

Vinyls Segment Fuels Growth
---------------------------


Westlake's Q4 income from operations for the vinyls segment hit $166 million. That's an increase of $98 million from the same quarter a year ago.


"In our vinyls segment, the PVC market continues to experience strong demand from our customers, especially in the residential construction, automotive and appliance industries," Chao said on an earnings conference call last month. "The robust residential construction market is also driving strong durable goods demand, benefiting our full product offering in our downstream building products business."


Chao predicts solid demand for polyethylene will continue into 2021. "This is driven by continued end-use demand in the essential everyday products, such as consumer products packaging, health care, hygiene and food service markets."


To meet demand, Westlake has expanded its PVC capacity by some 800 million pounds over the last two years.


Westlake's Q4 olefins income from operations dropped by $29 million year over year to $22 million. It said the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of hurricanes.

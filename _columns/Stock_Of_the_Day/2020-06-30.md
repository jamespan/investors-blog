Inphi Riding High After First-Quarter Results
---------------------------------------------


Santa Clara, Calif.-based Inphi makes high-speed data connections. Its products move large amounts of data quickly between and inside data centers.


On May 8, Inphi stock gapped up after the company delivered a [beat-and-raise quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inphi-stock-jumps-beat-raise-quarterly-report/). Inphi earned an adjusted 62 cents a share on sales of $139.4 million in the first quarter. Analysts expected earnings of 55 cents a share on sales of $135.2 million. On a year-over-year basis, Inphi earnings jumped 88% while sales rose 70% in the March quarter. It was the company's strongest quarterly sales growth in 4-1/2 years.


For the current quarter, Inphi predicts adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share on sales of $149.9 million. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 86% in earnings and 74% in sales. Analysts were looking for earnings of 50 cents a share on sales of $133.9 million in the second quarter.


Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore rates Inphi stock as overweight with a price target of 125.


"The company's core strength in high-speed analog design is driving its products for data centers and telecom, with strong growth potential over the next three years," he said in a recent note to clients.

**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the coronavirus-cloud play forges an alternate entry point. Zoom Video stock has consolidated as analysts debate how much sustainable upside there could be from paid consumer subscribers amid growing competition in the business market.




Use of the company's cloud-based video calling service has surged during the coronavirus lockdown and stay-at-home directives. Amid Zoom's high valuation, one issue is whether growth will be sustained as the economy rebounds.


Zoom Video stock is off its 52-week intraday high of 281 set on July 13. That all-time high marked a 313% gain in 2020 and followed its April quarter earnings release. First-quarter profit rocketed 566% higher to 20 cents a share on an adjusted basis. Revenue soared 169% to $328.2 million.


Zoom Video stock consolidated as analysts mulled growing competition. In the business market, pre-coronavirus rivals included **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), LogMeIn and Fuze. **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) have pushed into the business video calling market amid the coronavirus crisis, aiming to derail Zoom Video's torrid growth.

On a weekly chart, Zoom bounced off its 10-week moving average last week. The 10-week moving average often provides a new entry after a big run-up and stocks take a breather.


Zoom Video Stock Now In Buy Range
---------------------------------


That [forged a new entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) at 260.03. Shares jumped 5.6% to close at 268 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), putting shares in buy range.


Zoom is set to report second-quarter earnings in early September. Analysts project 460% earnings growth to 45 cents a share from a year earlier, with revenue surging 240% to $499 million.


Still, the big question for investors may be whether Zoom Video's growth is sustainable. Cisco, Microsoft, Facebook and Google are formidable rivals, and the stakes are big.


"We believe we are in a new world where video conferencing will continue to play a much larger role in our businesses, schools and everyday lives," Baird analyst William Power said in a recent note to clients.


Zoom's Ability To Monetize Is Key
---------------------------------


The company's ability to convert free users into paid subscribers is key to Zoom Video stock. Daily active participants hit 300 million in April, the company has said.


"While theoretical, any consumer focused revenue would help complement strong enterprise (Zoom) Meetings traction, in addition to growing Zoom Phone revenue," Power added.


The company said it had 265,400 business customers as of April 30, each with more than 10 employees. That's more than triple the 81,900 reported in the January quarter.


Zoom Video plans to cross-sell its new Zoom Phone appliance to its fast-growing base of business customers. The company has been marketing Zoom Phone with its video product known as Meetings, geared for business customers.


Zoom Video Stock And 'Hardware As A Service'
--------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Zoom Video isn't resting on its laurels. In early July, it announced a new "Hardware-as-a-Service" subscription program. It targets companies with 100 to 1,000 employees.


"For Zoom, it increases stickiness of both the Zoom Phone and Room products for customers," Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall said in a report to clients.


In addition, Zoom Video is forging new deals in the enterprise market, such as one with software maker **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


Further, Zoom Video stock has a lofty [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94 out of a possible 99.

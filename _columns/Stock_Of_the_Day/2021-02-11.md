With over 35 million active monthly users around the world, **Playtika** ([PLTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTK)), today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is trying to launch its first breakout. The Israeli mobile game developer, which had its initial public offering several weeks ago, is already among the top IPO stocks to watch. It's also earned a spot on Investor's Business Daily's [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).




Playtika joins **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **KE Holdings** ([BEKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEKE)) and **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) on this list of leading new issues. Like Playtika, BEKE, HUYA and DOCU stocks are all in or near new buy zones.


With its Jan. 15 IPO less than one month old, Playtika hasn't traded long enough to establish an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), which requires a minimum of 13 weeks. But its 3.2 up/down volume ratio points to demand.


As brand-new IPO stocks typically do because of a lack of data, Playtika has a low [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) of 41. Look for that to rise in the coming weeks and months.

2021 IPO Stocks To Watch: Playtika Profits With Mobile Gaming
-------------------------------------------------------------


Founded in 2010, Playtika has more than 3,700 employees in 19 offices worldwide, including in Tel Aviv, London, Berlin, Vienna, Las Vegas, Sydney, Bucharest and Santa Monica, Calif.


With titles like Bingo Blitz and Pirate Kings, Playtika mashes together art and science that are designed to deliver engaging, fully customized game experiences. For seamless play, the games are geared to synchronize across platforms and devices.


Playtika is set to release its first earnings report as a public company before the market open on Feb. 25. Analyst estimates call for a 114% spike in per-share earnings growth. For the full year, analysts expect a loss, but see Playtika delivering 300% earnings growth in 2021.


Over the last seven quarters, Playtika has delivered revenue gains ranging from 20% to 39%.


Playtika earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales, profit margins and return on equity as a whole. The company sports an annual pretax profit margin of 23.1%.


Platika's RS Line At New High Ahead Of Earnings
-----------------------------------------------


In a sign of stock market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) for Playtika has already hit a new high ahead of its upcoming earnings report.


Playtika is working on an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), showing a 36.16 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares dropped Thursday, but Playtika came well off its lows to the upper half of the day's price range. It closed at 33.70, down 0.6% on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The stock is up more than 9% for the week.


Keep in mind that [new IPO stocks can be volatile](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-ipo-stocks-lessons-from-facebook-snap/). As **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and many others have shown, many IPO stocks stumble before they find their footing. You can reduce your risk and still reap rewards by waiting for IPO stocks to form their first base before investing.


But as DOCU stock has already shown as it sets up once more, IPO stocks showing the CAN SLIM traits have the potential to make big moves.


While protecting your self with defensive sell rules, see if Playtika, KE Holdings and Huya — the latter of which broke out today — can deliver on their promise.

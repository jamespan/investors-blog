Herbalife Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------


Herbalife stock dipped 1% to 56.53 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares have been consolidating in a [saucer-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/). As of Friday's close Herbalife stock has a handle with a 58.80 buy point.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been hitting new highs for weeks. Herbalife stock hit its consolidation low on Oct. 10 and has been trending higher, finding support at its 50-day line since early November. And the consolidation follows a strong run-up from the end of last year.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index has plunged to 52-week lows. 


With the stock market correction getting deeper and the Nasdaq composite in bear market territory, this is no time to be making new purchases. Herbalife stock is worthy of watch lists. However, investors should wait for a confirmed market uptrend before getting off the sidelines.


Herbalife Earnings Turnaround
-----------------------------


Herbalife Nutrition earns an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. But an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 68 reflects an Herbalife earnings slowdown in the past two years.


However, Herbalife earnings jumped 80% to 74 cents a share in the latest quarter, the best gain in years. In the last three quarters, EPS growth averaged 32% after averaging 1% over the past three years.


Sales growth also has been spotty but has accelerated for the past four quarters.


Herbalife Nutrition Taps Obesity, Aging
---------------------------------------


As of 2017, Herbalife Nutrition had 4 million members and global net sales of $4.4 billion. The company targets growing obesity among an increasingly overweight population in the U.S. and around the world. It also taps the increased desire to age healthily that's found among an aging population.


It counts China, India, the U.S., Russia and Mexico as its top five markets.


Investors flocked to Herbalife Nutrition — and health and wellness companies broadly — this year as consumers grow more health-conscious in the age of selfies and social media.

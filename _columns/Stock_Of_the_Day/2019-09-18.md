**Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) is the IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity stock nears an entry point amid growing adoption of cloud-based email by large businesses. Proofpoint stock has outperformed peers in the IBD Computer Software-Security group, whose ranking has dropped recently.




Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection. It competes with **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)),**Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)), **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), as well as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


"Our research indicates that customers will continue to retire legacy on-premise email protection solutions and move to the cloud," Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz said in a recent note to clients. "And as they do, exposure levels invariably rise. A significant runway remains for Proofpoint to grow as cloud email security adoption rises."


Proofpoint stock slipped 0.6% to 126.48 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). The cybersecurity stock has an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 128.98, having formed a [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-basics-analyze-both-daily-weekly-stock-charts/). On Tuesday, Proofpoint stock briefly traded above the buy point, then pulled back.

Proofpoint stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 89 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That's a bullish signal, as it has outperformed 89% of all other stocks. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.


In addition, Proofpoint touts an IBD [Composite Ratin](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/)g of 98.


Proofpoint Stock: Reasons To Be Cautious
----------------------------------------


Needham analyst Alex Henderson, in his recent report to clients, said: "Proofpoint seems to be a forgotten cloud player. It is quietly putting up strong numbers with 25% (revenue) growth guidance, dominating a critical segment of the market."


The IBD Computer Software Security group now ranks [No. 121 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-sep-17-2019/), down from No. 10 eight weeks ago. However, Proofpoint stock sports an [Accumulation-Distribution Rating of A+](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-key-to-investment-success/). The Accumulation-Distribution Rating analyzes interest among institutional buyers and sellers in the stock.


Still, there are reasons to be cautious on Proofpoint stock.


The cybersecurity firm has met resistance near the 130 price level before. Shares retreated after hitting intraday highs of 130.27 on May 10, 2018, as well as 129 on July 19 last year. Shares also pulled back after hitting 131.43 on April 25, 2019, and 132.85 on July 26 this year.


Proofpoint Partners With CrowdStrike
------------------------------------


Furthermore, Proofpoint stock formed a [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) from July, 2018, through February. The base had a depth of 41%. Bases with depths of more than 40% often make it difficult for a stock to meaningfully advance from buy points.


Proofpoint recently announced a partnership with **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)). The two cybersecurity firms will integrate products. CrowdStrike's initial public offering in June raised $659 million.


CrowdStrike's software detects malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.


Proofpoint acquired Wombat Security Technologies, a spin-off from Carnegie Mellon University, for $225 million in early 2018. Wombat specializes in detecting phishing scams.


In phishing scams, hackers send fake emails that are designed to trick company employees into clicking on a link that sends them to a bogus webpage. There, hackers aim to obtain pass codes and other personal data.

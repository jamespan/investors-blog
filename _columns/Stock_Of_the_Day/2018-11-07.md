Billings of $280.7 million topped the forecast of analysts for $266.2 million.


Tableau Revenue Outlook
-----------------------


Starting in the first quarter of 2019, Tableau will shift to a modified reporting standard called ASC 606. Under this new standard, revenue would have been $290.6 million for the third quarter. That's up 35% from the year-ago period and the third quarter in a row of revenue acceleration.


Also based on ASC 606, Tableau expects revenue in 2019 in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. The midpoint of $1.35 billion is above the consensus estimate of $1.14 billion. That's up 20% from the prior year on a comparable accounting basis.


"We believe a key driver of the acceleration is product and pricing innovation, which has made analytics more accessible to the enterprise," Needham analyst Jack Andrews wrote in a note to clients. He has a buy rating on Tableau and a price target on Tableau stock of 134, up from a previous target of 126.


"We believe Tableau shares are poised to benefit from market growth, specific product catalysts, and the cloud transition," Andrews wrote.


Subscription Model Transition
-----------------------------


Tableau has been transitioning to a subscription-based software business model for the past six quarters. In April, the company announced a modified subscription model that's designed to help organizations scale analytics to their entire workforce.


"We've made it easier for customers to tailor Tableau to everyone in an organization, regardless of skill set, from analysts that shape, manage and prepare data to the front-line employees that view and interact with the dashboard," said Tableau Chief Executive Adam Selipsky, during the earnings conference call with analysts.


He announced that Tableau, during the quarter, signed its largest new customer in its history. It's a Fortune 500 insurance company that will deploy Tableau to over 10,000 people in their organization.


"The flexibility of our subscription offerings means that customers can choose to deploy Tableau in the way that best suits their unique organizational needs," he said.


Tableau Customers

Tableau customers include **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)).


UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe in a research note maintained a buy rating on Tableau and price target of 130.


"This looks to be one of the strongest quarters we've seen from Tableau in some time," she wrote.


Regarding Tableau's revenue guidance for 2019, "We see significant potential for this number to move higher as Tableau executes, as the midpoint implies conservative sales productivity assumptions based on our calculations," she said.

**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after bullishly ramming through its 50-day line on [strong holiday sales figures](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-kohls-jcpenny-l-brands-holiday-sales-fall-costco-sales-jump/).




The [Leaderboard stock's](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) move offers a buying opportunity now, while it is also closing in on a flat-base buy point for less aggressive investors who prefer more traditional breakouts.


Costco stock got a boost Thursday announcing sales for December increased 10.5% to $17.04 billion, with same-store sales up 9% and e-commerce sales popping by 43%. For the quarter, net sales climbed 7.5% to $56.99 billion. Full quarterly results will likely come in March.


The discount giant noted the positive effects from the later-than-usual Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It estimated e-commerce sales benefited by an estimated 20 percentage points in total, and that comp sales were positively impacted by about 1%.

Costco Stock Nears Buy Point
----------------------------


Shares closed up 1.6% at 299.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), climbing back above their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). This bullish move represents a buy signal right now for more aggressive investors, due to the stock's status as a long-term leader.


And those who want to see Costco stock prove itself more may prefer to wait for it to break out from its [current flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 307.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Among other stocks in the Retail-Major Discount Chains Industry Group, Dow Jones giant **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rose 1% Thursday, and current group leader **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) added 0.1%.


Recent stock market performance has weighed on Costco's [IBD Composite Rating, which now stands at 75](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). of a best-possible 99. The relative strength line also remains below recent highs. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-costco-wholesale-corp-cost.aspx) shows earnings are strong, but not ideal. The three-year average EPS growth rate of 18% falls short of the 25% growth benchmark sought by [CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


But the Institutional Sponsorship component of the CAN SLIM formula bodes well for Costco stock, which has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-.](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-tools/accumulationslhdistribution-(accslhdistm)-rating) This means there has been moderate buying of the stock by institutions over the past 13 weeks.



Costco Dances With The Dragon
-----------------------------


One reason Costco stock has won favor from investors is its move to tap the Chinese market. This could be a huge growth driver for years to come, and the signs so far are very positive.


So many shoppers mobbed the opening of its first ever Chinese warehouse in Shanghai back in August that the store had to shut down early on its first day for safety reasons.


Management said during its earnings call last October there had been a record number of sign-ups, with more than 200,000 memberships so far. These fees provide a key source of income for Costco. It also compares favorably with a worldwide average of 68,000 additions for both a mature and a new club.


Sales have "remained very strong" since the Shanghai store opened, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said in December. He added that the next opening is planned for "early 2021." It will also be in Shanghai, in the area of Pudong.


"The sign-ups continue to do very well there," Galanti also said last month, without offering any specific numbers. "And we will see. So we have had a great reception. We feel good about it from a merchandising standpoint and maintaining a supply chain."

**Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after notching a quarterly beat that included $3.2 billion in sales of its **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE))-rivaling Covid pill. Merck stock is now eyeing a fresh buy point.




The Ridgeback Biotherapeutics-partnered treatment called Lagevrio generated more than one-fifth of [Merck](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/merck-stock-buy-now/)'s sales during the quarter. It rivals [Pfizer](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/)'s Paxlovid. Overall sales surged by half in the first quarter. Excluding Lagevrio's impact, Merck reported 19% sales growth.


Now, the company expects the Covid pill to bring in $5 billion to $5.5 billion in full-year sales. It also raised its 2022 earnings and sales outlooks.


In response, Merck stock surged 4.9% to close at 88.58 on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

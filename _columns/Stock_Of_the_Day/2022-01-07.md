Morgan Stanley stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares of the investment bank are in a base, closing in on a buy point ahead of earnings later this month.




The setup comes as Morgan Stanley and other bank stocks consolidate while investors weigh the potential impact of omicron, higher yields and the [Fed's signals of a more aggressive stance toward inflation](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-hawkish-fed-slams-market-rally-tesla-microsoft-google-break-key-levels/).


Morgan Stanley stock
--------------------


Morgan Stanley stock ended up 0.6% to 104.19 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). The stock was in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 106.05 buy point.


That base began in September. Shares could eventually form a handle.


Morgan Stanley stock has an 86 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 84.



Rival **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) finished flat at 397.60 on Friday. GS stock was also in a flat base, with a 426.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's just above its 50-day line, but also could be working on a handle.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), up 0.1% to 167.16, was also in a flat base with a 173.06 buy point. JPM stock popped above its 50-day line on Tuesday, offering an early entry. That move could now turn into a handle.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) rose 2.2% to 49.18, clearing a cup base with a 48.79 buy point. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) climbed 2.1% to 54.77. That stock was still within range of a 52.66 buy point of a flat base.


Investment Banking Strong
-------------------------


Morgan Stanley stock rose through much of last year, helped by a strong deal pipeline, rising markets and a rebounding economy. However, [markets were mixed Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-falls-after-disappointing-jobs-report-bofa-makes-solid-breakout/) after the December jobs report missed forecasts.


The bank's [third-quarter results, reported in October, beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-gain-ahead-of-q3-earnings-reports/). Investment banking revenue surged, helped by IPOs and mergers and acquisitions.


"Investment Banking had its best quarter in history, and within that, M&A also produced its own record quarter," CEO James Gorman said on the company's third-quarter earnings call. "Equities are extremely strong and fixed income was stable."


Still, he said he expected the Federal Reserve would soon begin rolling back its pandemic-era support economic measures and then raise rates this year. The Fed is indeed scaling back its asset purchases, which should go to zero by mid-March. It's signaling several interest rate hikes and possibly reducing its massive balance sheet.


Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are less sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations than some of their rivals, since they lean primarily on trading, investment banking and wealth management.


JPMorgan and Wells  Fargo will kick off Q4 bank earnings on Friday, Jan. 14. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are due the following week.

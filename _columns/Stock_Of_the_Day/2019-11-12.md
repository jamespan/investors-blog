**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the transformational, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))-challenging Disney+ streaming service debuts, albeit amid some glitches. Disney stock rose toward an early buy point.




The Dow Jones media and entertainment conglomerate is banking its future on Disney+, as its traditional media channels lose subscribers amid a shift in consumer habits toward over-the-top content.


"This is necessary," [CEO Bob Iger told the Hollywood Reporter last month](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/bob-iger-bets-company-hollywood-s-future-streaming-1247663). "The risk would have been essentially maintaining a status quo approach to how we were managing our content."


The new streaming service has so far gotten strong reviews from Wall Street analysts, but the debut of Disney+ Tuesday marks its first big test among consumers with its complement of original content. (A beta version launched in the Netherlands in September.)


Disney tweeted Tuesday morning that "[demand for #DisneyPlus has exceeded our highest expectations](https://twitter.com/disneyplus)." Disney added it's "working quickly" to resolve issues after the video streaming platform ran into some technical bumps soon after launch.


Disney also added a [few more Marvel Cinematic Universe titles](https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1193985534927892480) to the 600-plus modern, classic and original movies and shows available on launch day for Disney+.

Two Entries For Disney Stock
----------------------------


Shares closed up 1.35% to 138.58 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Disney stock is about 6% below a 147.25 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but breaking resistance around 140 could serve as an early entry for aggressive investors.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) eased 0.7%. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which offer the rival Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ services, rose 0.4% and dipped 0.1% respectively.


The consolidation of Disney stock has a weak spot. The base has formed largely under the 50-day moving average. Moreover, the relative strength line, tracking Disney stock's performance against the S&P 500, is lagging. It's now nearly back where it was before the April 12 Disney+ launch announcement.


An RS Rating of 74 reflects Disney's recent weakness in terms of share price performance. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- indicates moderate institutional buying of Disney shares in the past 13 weeks.


The overall [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), combining key fundamental and technical metrics, is a poor 67 out of 99. That's due in large part to Disney's three-year earnings growth rate of 6%, reflecting a flat result in fiscal 2017 and a 19% drop in fiscal 2019. Analysts expect a 6% EPS decline in all of 2020, followed by a 15% increase in fiscal 2021.


Disney stock's EPS Rating of 44 is well below the 80 or higher that investors would want to see.

Disney+ Streaming Service
-------------------------


Disney's new growth opportunities — embodied in Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu — are dragging on earnings as billions of dollars in investments go toward ramping up the streaming services.


But Wall Street views Disney+ as a potential game-changer, with some analysts predicting the [new Disney streaming service](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-streaming-service-biggest-best-shows-to-watch-on-launch-day/) will likely drive Disney stock in upcoming quarters.


Analysts have also raised their estimates for Disney+ subscribers in its first year, due in part to partnership deals with telecoms and hardware makers, as well as an earlier-than-expected launch date in Europe. Meanwhile, Disney expects 60 million-90 million global subscribers for Disney+ by 2024. Major Wall Street firms have largely backed those views.


Back in August, one analyst even cited several reasons why [Disney should emerge victorious against Netflix stock](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-rallies-disney-plus-streaming-video-beat-netflix/) in the video streaming wars.


Others analysts say Netflix may see modest incremental churn from new competition, but is unlikely to lose many subscribers.


"Only 5% of our survey pool said they are likely to cancel (Netflix) service for Disney+," Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/streaming-wars-wall-street-thinks-netflix-can-weather-disney-launch.html).

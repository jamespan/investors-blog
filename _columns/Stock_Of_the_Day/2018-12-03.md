Epam Systems is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the information-technology services firm stands out in an industry experiencing fast-growing demand for digital services. Epam stock rose in Monday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) after clearing key resistance levels last week.




Newtown, Pa.-based Epam specializes in custom software development and platform engineering services. Its biggest customer is investment bank **UBS** ([UBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBS)). Other clients include Aer Lingus, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Google, and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) unit GE Healthcare Science.


"Epam is well-positioned to see its revenue and earnings continue growing at an industry leading 20%-to-25% year-over-year pace," said Surinder Thind, analyst at Jefferies, in a November report. "The company is benefiting from its focus on delivering complex solutions in the digital applications space, which is experiencing robust, growing demand."


The IT services industry faces challenges, added the Jefferies analyst.


"Legacy services such as application maintenance and outsourcing face transformative headwinds," Thind said. He says Epam has less exposure to the older products than many other IT services providers.

Epam Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Epam stock rose 3.2% to 134.43 in Monday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), hitting a two-month high intraday. Shares are building the right side of a three-month consolidation with a 144.29 buy point, according to [Marketsmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Last week, Epam stock cleared its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, breaking a recent downtrend. Shares hit a recent low of 100.72 on Oct. 30.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is close to a new high. The RS line hitting a new high before a stock does is especially bullish.



Epam Earnings, Fundamentals Strong
----------------------------------


In the latest quarter, Epam earnings rose 27% vs. a year earlier, right in a recent growth trend. Revenue climbed 24%, the second straight quarter of decelerating growth but still solid and in line with long-term trends. In the December quarter, analysts project profit growth of 21% to $1.22 a share.


The [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 95 out of a best-possible 99. All-time stock winners tend to have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.


Epam Systems' Customers Seek Digital Transformation
---------------------------------------------------


Roughly 60% of Epam revenue comes from North America.


Many Epam Systems employees reside in Eastern Europe, as opposed to other IT services firms with staffers concentrated in India. Epam rivals include giants such as **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)), midsize **Cognizant Technologies** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) and specialist shops like **Perficient** ([PRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRFT)).


"Epam's focus on revenue-generating projects is viewed by customers as a vital lever to transforming their businesses for the digital age," said Arvind Ramnani, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst in a report.


"The company's engineering foundation continues to see healthy demand given that emerging technologies require a high degree of process re-engineering, system architecture design and data science."


Epam Acquisitions May Pick Up
-----------------------------


Unlike Accenture, which has made many acquisitions to expand into digital services, Epam has bought only a few companies since 2015. However, Epam in March acquired Continuum, a Boston-based engineering design firm. It could be a sign of more deals to come.


"Looking ahead to 2019, we expect M&A activity to pick up, especially in light of management's desire to expand its clientele, markets and geographic reach, (as well as) its consulting capabilities," said Thind at Jefferies.


Epam is in the Computer-Technology Services group. It's ranked No. 84 out of 197 industry groups. Epam, **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) and Accenture have the highest Composite Ratings in the group.

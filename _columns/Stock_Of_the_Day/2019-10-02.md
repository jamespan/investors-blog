Analyst Rates Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


UBS analyst Jay Sole recently upgraded Burlington Stores stock to neutral from sell, and hiked his target from 121 to 200. He believes there is now less risk of downward EPS revision at the store, while tailwinds are also in play.


"Tariffs are likely a net positive for Burlington," he said in a Sept. 16 research note. "BURL and other off-price retailers accelerated their rate of share gain vs. department stores in Q2, reversing a trend which had persisted for over a year."


According to Sole, tariffs are likely causing significant order cancellations from many full-price retailers. This is giving Burlington Stores the chance to buy inventory at a discount. He also said it is likely that tariffs drive many weak retailers to close stores.

Chegg([CHGG]) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the leading online education platform capitalizes on its Covid opportunity to accelerate growth. Part of the premier [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock list, Chegg stock climbed near a buy point on Friday as it gained ground for a seventh straight session.




Chegg Study, its main $14.95-per-month cloud-based service, gives students who need coursework help a vast online library of support tools for science, math, business and engineering subjects. Bundled access to Study, Writing and Math Solver via the Chegg Study Pack costs $19.95 per month.


Chegg Accelerates International, Skills-Based Growth
----------------------------------------------------


Chegg began focusing on international expansion two years ago.Â Then Chegg branched out into skills-based learning, helping to more directly connect older students with career opportunities, with its September 2019 purchase of online coding school Thinkful for $80 million.


In June, Chegg expanded its education resources with the $100 million acquisition of Mathway, a popular problem-solving app for high school students with subscribers in 100 countries and 13 languages.


CFO Andy Brown told a Dec. 8 Raymond James online investor conference that Chegg had four core countries before the coronavirus: the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia. But the outbreak of Covid highlighted just how big the international opportunity is for Chegg, he said. "That four has become 15 core countries."


He expects international subscribers to outnumber U.S. subscribers within 10 years.


Meanwhile, Brown said that Chegg is a "fledgling" in skills-based learning but will continue to build out its resources through acquisitions, as it has done with its Chegg Study platform.

Chegg Stock
-----------


Chegg stock has been a huge winner, surging 900% since an April 2017 breakout. After more than tripling off its coronavirus low, Chegg stock looked primed for another breakout on Oct. 26, just ahead of its late-day earnings report. But shares sold off the next day, despite [Chegg's better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/chegg-stock-chegg-earnings-q3-2020/) and healthy guidance for both Q4 and 2021.


Yet, after a dip below its 50-day line, Chegg stock has been on a steady climb back within 2% of its 89.99 Oct. 26 high. Chegg has a 90.09 buy point, 10 cents above that high, from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), according to a [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Shares have run up fast over the past several weeks without much of a pause. Ideally, CHGG stock would form a handle before breaking out, shaking out weak holders. But cup-without-handle patterns can be powerful.


Chegg stock has an excellent 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating combines several key fundamental and technical factors into a single score. IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.


Post-Covid Slowdown?
--------------------


Chegg is generally lumped into the group of stay-at-home stocks that have thrived during the coronavirus, but could be in for a big slowdown in its aftermath.


That may be true to an extent. Chegg revenue grew 64% from a year ago in Q3, the fifth straight quarter of accelerating growth. For 2021, guidance suggests 23% growth, but that's still pretty solid and may be conservative.


"In the U.S., we are seeing growth from many sectors including students who are taking more courses online, increased penetration into online colleges and the impact of our technology efforts to reduce (unauthorized) account sharing," CEO Dan Rosensweig said on the Q3 call.


Plus, Chegg has a long runway for international and skills-based growth. "Students everywhere are seeking alternative, less expensive pathways to pursue their careers," Rosensweig said. "That is why we invested in Thinkful and in skills-based learning. We think our strategy of increasing the curriculum to match the most in-demand jobs, lowering our prices, offering income -sharing agreements and building in live chat support is a better model than anyone else has to offer."

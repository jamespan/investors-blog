Revenue jumped 44% to $108.5 billion, as the e-commerce and cloud computing giant also guided higher. It expects second-quarter revenue in the range of $110 billion to $116 billion, above estimates of $108.8 billion.


Revenue for the company's cloud service outfit, Amazon Web Services, jumped 32% to $13.5 billion, with an operating profit of $4.16 billion.


Price Targets Raised On Amazon Stock
------------------------------------


Multiple analysts raised their price target on Amazon stock, ranging from a high of 4,500 down to 4,125.


"First-quarter results reflected accelerated momentum across all segments," Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said in a note to clients. He raised his price target on Amazon stock to 4,400, from 4,200.


Amazon entered 2021 with plenty of big opportunities, including plans to expand its virtual health care program across the U.S.


On March 17, Amazon announced that its telehealth pilot program called [Amazon Care](https://www.amazon.care/), which it launched at its Seattle headquarters 18 months ago, will expand to all of its U.S. employees and their families, as well as to other firms, this summer.


If Amazon can deliver more efficient health care services, the potential is enormous for fueling its growth engine â€” and by extension Amazon stock. Health care now comprises nearly a fifth of the U.S. economy.


The company ended the quarter with more than 200 million paid Amazon Prime members. They are Amazon's most lucrative customers. That's up by 50 million since the third quarter of 2020.


Preparing For CEO Transition
----------------------------


On Feb. 2, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he would [hand off his role as chief executive](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-fourth-quarter-bezos-jassey-amzn/) in the third quarter of 2021. The new CEO will be Andy Jassy, the CEO of its cloud computing unit. Bezos is not leaving. He will transition to the role of Executive Chairman and remain active.


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) tool shows that Amazon stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 83. The rating means Amazon stock currently outperforms 83% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


But its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is a weak 39. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks. Ideally, look for stocks with a rating of 80 or higher.

Amazon Stock Above 50-Day Line
------------------------------


AMZN stock popped above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on April 5, a positive indicator.

**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), has formed its first base since trading began in April with a highly successful initial public offering that raised $1.4 billion.




Pinterest provides a website where users post photos, charts and other images covering a wide range of categories and interests, with visual search capabilities. The postings are called pins, hence the company name.


The company had 300 million monthly active users at the end of the second quarter, up 30% from the year-ago period and higher than Wall Street expected.


Pinterest stock gapped up in massive volume on Aug. 2 after the firm posted a blowout [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinterest-earnings-second-quarter-stock/).

Pinterest Trading Volume Soars
------------------------------


Trading volume on the earnings report was the highest since the company's IPO debut, suggesting institutional investors may have taken notice of Pinterest's quarterly results and climbed on board.


Revenue jumped 62% from the year-ago period to $261.3 million vs. expectations of $233.7 million. It lost 6 cents per share, vs. an expected loss of 8 cents.


The San Francisco-based company raised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion, up from $1.05 billion to $1.08 billion.


"We continued to grow and diversify our advertiser base and improve advertisers' ability to measure the effectiveness of their ad spend," said Pinterest Chief Executive Ben Silbermann, in prepared remarks with [the earnings release](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-cuts-rates-q2-earnings-190207771.html). "This is part of our larger and ongoing effort to create value for businesses on Pinterest."


Pinterest stock rocketed 18.6% in huge share turnover to 33.57 the following day in reaction to the report. It climbed as high as 35.21 in intraday trading, just below its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 35.39 out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). Pinterest went public at 19 on April 18.


Bullish Signal For Pinterest Stock
----------------------------------


In a bullish move, Pinterest stock edged up slightly Monday on a day when the stock market overall tanked. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a record high on Monday, then pulled back with Tuesday's stock market action. The relative strength line compares a stock's price action with that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line implies the stock is being passed up.


Pinterest stock fell 3.1% to close at 32.68 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Keep in mind that investors should be holding off on new purchases, even promising new IPOs, given the volatile environment. With the stock market in a correction, it's a good time for investors to look for stocks that are holding up well relative to the pervasive weakness, and build their watch list.


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows that Pinterest has anÂ [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 77 out of 99. That means the stock outpaces 77% of all stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.


It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 95, which also reflects strong [stock market performance](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


But its [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1), which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth with all other stocks, is a weak 36. Pinterest is not profitable, but it's moving in that direction.

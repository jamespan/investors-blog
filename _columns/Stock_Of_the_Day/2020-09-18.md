**Kingsoft Cloud** ([KC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KC)) is theÂ [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Chinese IPO stock shows strength in a volatile market.




A spinoff of Chinese software giant Kingsoft, the firm sells cloud-computing services in China. Competitors in the sector includes the likes of e-commerce behemoth **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)).


Kingsoft Cloud managed to raise more than half a billion dollars when it went public in early May, despite that its offering took place amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It managed to price 30 million American Depositary Shares at 17 each. This helped it rake in $510 million on a valuation of roughly $3.7 billion. Its strong performance has seen its market cap shoot up to $5.7 billion.


**Kingsoft Cloud** Stock Analysis
---------------------------------


Shares were little changed Friday. Kingsoft Cloud stock has made a bullish move by breaking above a trend line touching the base's highs. However, 41.10 is acting as a resistance area.

It is offering up a 42.90 buy point after forming an irregular pattern, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). However investors should note this is only a stock to watch at the moment due to the weak overall market. Waiting to buy also gives it time to form a handle, which would offer a lower entry point.


[The stock's relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which compares a stock's performance to the S&P 500, underlines how powerful the stock has been acting of late. It has been spiking up almost vertically for the past week.



The IPO stock has a strong [IBD Composite Rating of 90](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), though this is an imperfect guide at such an early stage of the stock's life. It is fueled entirely by its excellent stock market performance. Its weak [EPS Rating of 30](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) reflects the fact the firm has yet to turn a profit.


Another black mark against the stock is its lack of institutional sponsorship. At the moment only 10% of its stock is held by funds. However, some notable backers are among them, such as the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX) and the Franklin DynaTech Fund Class A (FKDNX). Both of these are rated among the very best funds by Investor's Business Daily.


Analyst Backs **IPO** Stock
---------------------------


UBS analyst Thompson Wu is bullish on Kingsoft Cloud stock. But while he rates it as a buy, it is already past his 36 target.


He said that while China cloud adoption is well below U.S. levels, mobile internet consumption is fueling growth. He said 5G and "Artificial Intelligence of Things" will accelerate cloud adoption in coming years.


"KC focuses specifically on large/fast-growing verticals combined with tailored solutions that are thus far successful with a list of prominent companies," Wu said in a note to clients. "We expect KC's successful strategy will continue as cloud adoption accelerates in China."


The analyst added that Xiaomi and Kingsoft are key strategic partners, with 46.3% and 14.6% stakes, respectively. He said that should "contribute to KC's long-term growth and success."

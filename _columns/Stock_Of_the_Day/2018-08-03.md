Sometimes stocks trade in low volume for months flatlining. Other times they're in a trading range for months, moving up and down like a yo-yo.




Either way, investors could be waiting for the proverbial shoe to drop. It could be a stock catalyst. Or it could be a stock overhang. Maybe a rumor over an acquisition that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. That's the kind of thing that worries investors.


Now consider **SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)). It's IBD's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


The email delivery service went public in November with shares priced at 16. SendGrid stock moved up nicely, hitting 31 on March 9. Then, shares in the cloud-based email marketing platform hit resistance.

CLOSE




Denver-based SendGrid has been locked in a trading range of 25 to 32 for several months. The company reported second-quarter earnings on July 31.


The stock popped, moving above its 50-day moving average. But the rally stalled on Friday. SendGrid stock fell 4.9% to close at 28.48 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).


SendGrid stock is trading 10% below a technical buy point of 32.13. So what's going on?


Consumer Privacy A Stock Overhang
---------------------------------


For one, bears point to Europe's new General Data Protection Regulations. GDPR stiffened consumer data privacy protection. Consumers can opt in or opt out of releasing data on smartphones and other devices that can be used for targeted advertising


Europe's GDPR has been an overhang on **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which dominate in digital advertising. GDPR also has been a stock overhang for online marketing specialists.


Those companies include SendGrid and **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)). And, GDPR has loomed over companies with cloud-marketing units, such as **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


On their second-quarter earnings calls, Alphabet and Facebook said GDPR has not impacted advertising revenue. In the case of SendGrid, GDPR also seems not to be causing a serious problem.


At least that's what analysts gleaned from management commentary on its earnings call. GDPR took effect on May 25.


Few Holes
---------


"There isn't a whole lot to poke holes at this quarter," Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a note to clients. "GDPR, which will still cause concern for some investors, actually contributed an estimated 50 basis points of incremental revenue growth owing to the surge in email volume seen in advance of the regulations going live."


Davis added: "Further commentary suggested that since the May 25 go-live date, volume deliveries have been as expected across customers and geographies."


Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst, says SendGrid should be fine, though a decline in email contact lists remains a concern.


"The majority of SendGrid's business today is derived from transactional emails (79% of total revenue), which are less likely to be opted out of," Suri said in his note to clients. "We estimate a large majority of the company's transactional emails are approved emails (password resets, login confirmation) and not spam email, which is what the GDPR is attempting to avoid."


Size Of Earnings Beats Matter
-----------------------------


Putting GDPR aside, what else could investors be concerned about? With any new IPO, things to watch include the size of earnings and revenue beats as well as guidance. SendGrid stock fell 10% on May 2, the day after it reported first-quarter results as investors were disappointed.


On July 31, SendGrid reported second-quarter earnings. Profit climbed to 5 cents per share from 2 cents a year earlier. Revenue jumped 32% to $35.7 million.


Alex Zukin, analyst at Piper Jaffray, says SendGrid did better in the second quarter, though it didn't hit a home run.


"SendGrid posted a very strong Q2, beating guided revenues by 4% at the midpoint of guidance and raising full-year outlook by 1.4% vs. last quarter's (revenue) beat of 1.8% and raise by 0.9%."


SendGrid Similar To Atlassian?
------------------------------


Zukin rates the stock overweight. He compares SendGrid to **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


"Unlike the majority of enterprise software companies that spend 40% of revenues on sales and marketing, SendGrid spends 25%," he said in a report initiating coverage of the company.


He added: "The company is predominantly a self-service, inside-sales-driven model and does not plan to build out an enterprise sales force. We see SEND following in the footsteps of Atlassian."


SendGrid competes with privately held SparkPost and MailChimp as well as Amazon's Simple Email Service. SendGrid, though, has partnered with Amazon's cloud-computing service.

**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), following a bullish rebound from a key support level that some investors could use as a new entry point. Mastercard stock rose Thursday.




[CAN SLIM connoisseurs know the L in the acronym stands for Leader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), and Goldman Sachs has hailed Mastercard as a leader in B2B payments. The [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) offers end-to-end automated services, as well as cross-border payment options and a global trade platform created with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Earlier this week, Mastercard made its biggest ever acquisition, [snapping up a payments platform from Danish firm Nets for $3.19 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/mastercard-stock-biggest-ever-acquisition-payments-platform-nets/). The deal reflects the credit card giant's strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing global opportunity for real-time payments.


Mastercard has been hoovering up businesses as it looks to strengthen its position in the payments space. Earlier this year, it purchased identity fraud specialist Ethoca and point-of-sale payment provider Vyze. It also snapped up billing company Transactis and cross-border payments network Transfast. Mastercard has run up a $1.1 billion bill so far on acquisitions and strategic equity investments.

Mastercard Stock Analysis
-------------------------


Shares closed up 3.2% at 278.04 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), gapping up further from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) after retaking it on Wednesday, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). That follows a prior rebound from the 50-day line in early June.


This second bounce off that key support level could be an opportunity for aggressive investors to take a new, albeit small, position in Mastercard stock, though any purchases warrant extreme caution with the market outlook still in correction. Also, since it has made multiple pullbacks to the 10-week line, the latest move may not be as optimal as previous pullbacks.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been improving since February 2017 and is now at an all-time high. The RS line compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500, and when it slopes upward it means it is outperforming the broader index.


Mastercard stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 98, which puts it in the top 2% of stocks tracked. The [Stock Checkup Tool shows its has an attractive mixture](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mastercard-inc-cl-a-ma.aspx) of both strong fundamentals and excellent technical performance.


Mastercard earnings have grown by an average 22% over the last three quarters and rose 14% in Q2 to beat forecasts. This is shy of the 25% gain demanded by CAN SLIM. However, EPS has grown by an even more impressive 30% over the last three years. This outpaces revenue growth of 17%.



Key Trends Favoring Mastercard Stock
------------------------------------


Mastercard stock is seen by analysts as benefiting from ongoing expansion and digital initiatives. Several trends are benefiting payment stocks. Chief among these is the increasing use of electronic payments over cash and checks. While this process has been underway for some time on the consumer front, [business-to-business is set for rapid growth](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/). Mobile payments are also seen as an ongoing driver of growth.


Among other heavy hitters in the category, Mastercard's archrival **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is performing well, as is **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), despite following a different business model.


Meanwhile, **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and Warren Buffett-backed **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) have both more than doubled in value in 2019. Both Brazilian payment stocks report earnings next week.


Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider has said Mastercard stock will benefit from increasing share in the "underpenetrated" European market. This should boost Mastercard earnings. He also believes it is perfectly poised to lead in the B2B market, which is seen as [offering a $1 trillion opportunity for payment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/?preview_id=3729964).

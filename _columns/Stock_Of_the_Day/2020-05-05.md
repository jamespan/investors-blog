Online education technology leader **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after gapping up past a profit-taking zone amid accelerating revenue growth and a spike in subscribers. Investors can use the [earnings gap as a buying opportunity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/).




In Q1 Chegg earnings per share popped 46% to 22 cents, with growth picking up from 40% in Q4 2019. Analysts expected Chegg earnings of 17 cents a share late Monday, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Revenue rose 35% to $132 million, also beating views, with growth accelerating for a third straight quarter. Chegg Services subscriber numbers, meanwhile, popped higher by 35% year-over-year to 2.9 million.


Subscriber growth and engagement significantly increased amid the coronavirus crisis. Growth has been driven by both U.S. and international subscribers, which bodes well for the future.


Chegg managed to cane analysts once again after it served up Q2 revenue guidance of $135 million to $137 million. This was much higher than the $118 million consensus. However it withdrew full-year guidance due to the overarching uncertainty, including school start dates and enrollment trends.

"In these difficult times Chegg performed ahead of our expectations and we are grateful to have helped so many students," CEO Dan Rosensweig said in a press release.

Analyst Backs Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


Barrington Research President Alexander Paris reiterated his outperform rating on Chegg stock and hiked his price target from 50 to 60.


"We feel the premium valuation is justified, given its sustainable, above-average revenue growth rate (vs. both peer groups) and high and rising profitability, combined with a balance sheet including more than $1 billion in cash to finance further growth initiatives including strategic acquisitions when the time is right," he said in a research note.


California-based Chegg has moved on from its legacy textbook rental service, pressured by growing competition from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Barnes & Noble Education** ([BNED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNED)).


It now runs this part of its business in partnership with private operator Ingram Content, which provides the books and carries out the distribution, while students set up the rentals on Chegg's website. Ingram gets 100% of the fee and pays Chegg a 20% commission.


Chegg opted not to leave the market because it provides a funnel for sales leads. The real money comes when it sells digital services to the 6 million-7 million students per year who rent textbooks via the site.


The main product is Chegg Study, a $14.99 per month service that offers a vast online library of textbook solutions for science, math, business and engineering subjects. Other products include Chegg Writing and Chegg Tutors, which provide virtual online academic coaching.

**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the fast-growing provider of software used to troubleshoot company networks has proved especially useful during the pandemic. Datadog stock is hovering at a buy point.




In addition to troubleshooting software applications, Datadog's cloud-based tools also monitor business workloads deployed on Amazon Web Services and the Azure network from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Datadog rallied on Sept. 30, sending the fast-rising stock beyond a 99.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a 12-week consolidation and shooting above the high end of its [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) that day.


Since then, Datadog stock formed a brief consolidation, similar to a [handle on a cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) — particularly on the daily chart. In this case, the new buy point on Datadog is 109.70, extending to 115.18.

Datadog Thrives During Pandemic
-------------------------------


Datadog has thrived during the pandemic because the disruptions caused by the outbreak [put a strain on technology networks](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/datadog-stock-shines-coronavirus-drives-faster-devops-adoption/). Much of it was due to companies that tried to automate operations and track key business metrics in order to support employees working from home. Companies also sped up the deployment of digital applications for e-commerce and other business activities.


Datadog was there to help companies make the transition.


Its customers include Airbnb, **Walt Disney**'s ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) 21st Century Fox division, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)).


Datadog reported [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/datadog-earnings-datadog-stock-ddog-q22020/) on Aug. 6 that beat estimates. The company reported an adjusted profit of 5 cents per share, vs. expectations of a 1-cent loss, Revenue jumped 68% to $140 million, topping views of $135.4 million.


"Our execution was strong during challenging times, including continued platform adoption," Chief Executive Olivier Pomel said in a conference call with analysts. "While we are pleased with our execution in the quarter, we did experience some impact to the rate of usage growth of our customers related to the microenvironment."

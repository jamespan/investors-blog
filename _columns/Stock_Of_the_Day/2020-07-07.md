Mastercard stock is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the payments giant offers up two buying opportunities amid a spending recovery from coronavirus lockdowns.




**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) has been reporting a rebound in credit card use as social-distancing rules relax, though a resurgence in Covid-19 cases has forced some states and cities to roll back or pause reopenings.


In addition, the firm released research last month that said consumers are increasingly moving away from cash in favor of contact-free and digital payments experiences.


Meanwhile, the [Long-Term Leader stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) is also seen benefiting from the shift from checks to digital payments in the business-to-business payments arena.


The firm is continuing to expand despite the impact of Covid-19. On June 23, Mastercard announced it has agreed to acquire Finicity for $825 million, as well as a potential earn-out of $160 million. This is a move aimed at strengthening its open banking strategy. Analysts believe the move bolsters the payments giant's already strong European open banking initiative.


Open banking gives people and businesses more control over their financial data. it determines how and where third parties – such as fintechs or banks – can access that information. The deal is seen as further streamlining the credit decision-making process for consumers and small businesses.

Analyst Backs Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin is bullish on Mastercard stock. He rates it as a buy with a 370 target.


"Mastercard remains one of our best ideas in the space given our belief that investors should look to focus on long-term, secular-driven stories that provide solid organic growth with opportunities for margin expansion," he said in a June 24 research note.


Continued Improvement Seen
--------------------------


He pointed out that Mastercard had released three additional weeks of operating metrics for the second quarter through the week of June 21. Perlin said there was "continued improvement" in volume and transactions, while cross-border also saw "modest improvements."


The analyst said most markets are now in "normalization mode" following the impact of coronavirus lockdowns. This occurs when spending begins to gradually recover from lower levels seen during a containment and stabilization period.

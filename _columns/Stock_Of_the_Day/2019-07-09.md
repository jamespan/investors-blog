**Strategic Education** ([STRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as analysts forecast bullish earnings growth driven by higher enrollment and effective cost controls. Strategic Education stock has pulled back after a hot streak and is eyeing a new base.




Strategic Education Inc., or SEI, targets adult learners with brick-and-mortar campuses as well as online education programs and services.


Wall Street is [bullish on education stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/charter-schools-education-betsy-devos/), which tap the second largest industry after health care in the United States. **Grand Canyon Education** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) or **K12 Inc**. ([LRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRN)) have, like SEI, benefited from demand for online education and long-distance learning.


On Monday, [Chegg stock cleared a second-stage base](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/growth-stocks-to-watch-chegg-among-todays-fastest-growing-companies/) with a 41.79 buy point, while more aggressive investors might see 40.74 as an earlier entry.


In contrast to many peers, though, Strategic Education traces its history to 1892. That was the year that Dr. S. Irving Strayer opened a college in Baltimore to prepare working adults for the post-Industrial Revolution age.


In 1996, the company launched a pioneering online learning program, just as the Internet was starting to take off.


SEI, formerly known as Strayer Education, completed a merger with Capella Education Company last year. Capella University's fast-growing FlexPath program — allowing students to set their own deadlines and learning pace — is seen as a growth driver.


The company's also been deploying tech innovations, including artificial intelligence and automation, to lower operating costs.

Earnings Ramp Up For Strategic Education Stock
----------------------------------------------


SEI stock rose 0.7% to close at 181.19 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares broke out of a first-stage cup-with-handle base May 1, running up more than 20% by early June, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


They've now pulled back near to the 50-day moving average, trading tightly. By the end of this week, the stock could form a new flat base with a buy point of 187.05.


Strategic Education has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-). It also has a Relative Strength Rating of 96 out of 99, which measures the performance of its shares against those of other stocks. Plus, SEI ranks third highest among several top-performing companies in IBD's Consumer Services-Education industry group.


The group ranks 11th out of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-27-2018/). Chegg is ranked No. 1 and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) is No. 2 within the group.


Annual earnings for Strategic Education almost halved between 2012 and 2016. They've rebounded since, jumping 57% to $4.75 in 2018. In the latest quarter, EPS increased 35% to $1.66, smashing estimates, as sales more than doubled to $246.5 billion.


Analysts on average expect annual EPS to grow 35% in 2019 and then slow to 15% growth in 2020. Margins have expanded at both Strayer and Capella universities on improving enrollment trends and cost-control measures, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Institutional investors, including top funds such as Lord Abbott, have been snapping up shares. But the number of funds owning Strategic Education shares stood at 376 as of June, down slightly from 389 in March and from 391 in December.


Analysts cite decline in revenue per student at Strayer due to tuition cuts as a concern. It's also reducing the cost of its programs to make them more affordable for students, offering financial assistance in the final year of studies.

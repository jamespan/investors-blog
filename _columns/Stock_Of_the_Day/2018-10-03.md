**SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the email delivery service is benefiting from a broad rebound in small-cap stocks following two days of rotation-based selling.




SendGrid stock climbed 3.4% to close at 35.51 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The Russell 2000, a widely followed small-cap benchmark, gained 1% on Wednesday. The [Russell 2000 index fell 1%](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/leading-stocks-small-caps-slide-reasons-investors-cautious/) on Tuesday.


Small-cap stocks have lagged the broader stock market since the end of August. SendGrid stock is down from a high of 38 set on Sept. 11. Denver-based SendGrid went public in November with shares priced at 16.


While SendGrid stock may trade in sympathy with other small caps, the recent IPO can be viewed on its own merits.

SendGrid Names Chief Marketing Officer
--------------------------------------


The cloud-based email marketing platform late Tuesday named a new chief marketing officer to build up its brand.


The new executive, Carrie Palin, had been a senior vice president at Box, an online data storage and file-sharing service provider. Palin earlier was IBM's vice president of marketing for its cloud data services and analytics software division.


SendGrid competes with privately held SparkPost, MailChimp and others. Appointing a new chief marketing officer dovetails with SendGrid's goal of moving upmarket by helping customers develop email-based marketing campaigns.


The key to that is an application programming interface, or API, that allows clients to integrate email content into software applications.


"Growth drivers for SendGrid are fairly straight forward — it's adding customers and getting those customers to send more emails through SendGrid pipes," Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin said in a note to clients.


SendGrid Moves From 'Pipe To Application'
-----------------------------------------


Zukin added that Sendgrid is moving from "pipe to application." That means adding more value-add marketing services to a business that sends over a billion emails a day. Customers include Uber, Yelp, eBay, Spotify, Airbnb and Glassdoor.


"Future products, much like Marketing today, should come with higher prices and margin profiles," Zukin said. "Cost per email for the company's marketing application are 3 times to 4 times that of core Email API. The company believes that at scale marketing has the potential to be more profitable than Email API."


Other companies that use cloud-based APIs include digital payments startup Stripe and Twilio, the latter of which sells communications messaging software.


Following its IPO, SendGrid stock moved up steadily, closing around 31 on March 9. SendGrid stock fell 10% on May 2, the day after it reported first-quarter results as investors were disappointed.


But SendGrid's second-quarter results, which came on July 31, sparked a rally. Profit climbed to 5 cents per share from 2 cents a year earlier. Revenue jumped 32% to $35.7 million.


In the current quarter, analysts estimate profit of 3 cents and revenue of $36 million.

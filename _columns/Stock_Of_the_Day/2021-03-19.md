**Wayfair** is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the online retailer of furniture, appliances and home decor products edged near its buy zone Friday. Wayfair stock is showing several positive signs.




The e-commerce company has been a consistent performer during the Covid-19 disruption, having maintained double-digit revenue growth per quarter for several years and triple-digit earnings growth for the past three quarters.


On Friday, Wayfair stock broke out from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) chart pattern, following a two-month consolidation period. It has a buy point of 343.09, which extends to 360.24. Wayfair stock climbed 2.9% to close at 335.36 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is right at the edge of a new high. The RS line compares the stock's daily price performance with the S&P 500. An upward-sloping RS line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. It's bullish for the RS line to hit a new high as or before the stock breaks out.

Other Bullish Indicators For Wayfair Stock
------------------------------------------


Another positive is that Wayfair stock is trading above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). In addition, the stock is above the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). And, the stock has received key support at the 200-day moving average, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).


Boston-based Wayfair runs a variety of websites, offering more than 18 million items. The sites offer home furnishings, appliances and decor across a number of styles and price points. In addition to Wayfair.com, the company also runs Birch Lane, Joss & Main and Perigold.


Wayfair stock has been on an enormous run since hitting a multiyear low in mid-March. That's when the coronavirus disruption was in full swing. However, the stock has since leveled off as restrictions ease and fewer people are housebound.


[Wayfair reported mixed fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wayfair-stock-wayfair-earnings-q4-2020/) on Feb. 26 but indicated stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter.


It reported adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share on revenue of $3.67 billion. Wall Street expected Wayfair to report earnings of 85 cents a share on revenue of $3.75 billion. Revenue jumped 45% from the year-ago period.


54% Jump In Customer Growth
---------------------------


The number of active customers climbed 54% to 31.2 million in the fourth quarter. Repeat customers placed 72.5% of total orders, up from 69% a year ago.


"Online shopping behavior is becoming increasingly entrenched and consumer demand for the home category remains strong," said Niraj Shah, chief executive, in prepared remarks with the [Wayfair earnings release](https://s24.q4cdn.com/589059658/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Press-Release-Q4-2020-(1).pdf). "We are confident that our long-term orientation and years of investments should translate to compounding share gains and increasing profitability in a rapidly growing e-commerce market."


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-wayfair-inc-cl-a-w.htm) shows that Wayfair has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 81 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Wayfair currently outperforms 81% of all stocks. That's in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


The stock has a hearty [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 98. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


Retail Stocks Standing Out
--------------------------


Wayfair is not alone in showing healthy growth in the retail sector. Luxury home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), previously known as Restoration Hardware, was named [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/rh-stock-buy-point-warren-buffett-grows-stake/) on Feb. 26. Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BKRB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKRB)) recently added to its stake.


In addition, home goods and cookware retailer **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) was [IBD Stock Of The Day on Thursday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/williams-sonoma-stock-offers-multiple-buy-points-tears-higher/). That happened after the company [reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/wsm-stock-buy-point-williams-sonoma-earnings/), hiking its dividend, and announcing a new buyback.

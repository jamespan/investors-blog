**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it chases a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after building a new flat base. The discount retailer has been flourishing amid the coronavirus pandemic.




[Flat bases are important](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) as they are one of the few reliable patterns that quality stocks form before they make substantial price advances.


Discount stores have been performing well, as the Covid-19 recession spurs more consumers to look for bargains. This was highlighted when [Dollar General posted earnings that crushed Wall Street expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/dollar-general-earnings-q1-2020-dollar-tree-earnings-burlington-stores-ollies-bargain-outlets/) at the end of May. Earnings are also accelerating, which is a good sign.


Management expects to exceed the full-year guidance Dollar General issued in March. But due to the uncertainty surrounding the economy, it does not know by how much.

But the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Dollar General stock is giving mixed signals. It remains below recent highs hit in April and has been moving sideways of late, which means it is performing in line with the S&P 500.


But it could be taking a breather after sharply outperforming the index from mid-February until early March.


Dollar General stock has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating of 99](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). One encouraging aspect is the fact that the company's earnings are even better than its stock market performance. This is despite the fact the stock price is up more than 20% so far this year.


[The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dollar-general-corp-dg.aspx) earnings have grown by an average of 31% over the past three quarters. This is superior to the 25% growth sought by CAN SLIM investors. It is also better than the three-year average EPS growth rate of 20%. Earnings have accelerated for the past two quarters.


Analysts see earnings swelling 31% in 2021 and holding flat in 2022.


Dollar General stock also holds an A SMR Rating (sales, profit margins, return on equity). This means the retailer is in the top 20% of all stocks based on those gauges. Dollar General's 26.5% ROE in fiscal 2020 was its highest in at least nine years and well over the 17% minimum expected of leading growth stocks.



Another important consideration for [CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) is whether a stock has good institutional support. A number of funds highly rated by IBD own Dollar General stock, including Fidelity Select Retailing (FSRPX), MFS Growth Fund A (MFEGX) and Bridge Builder Large Cap Growth (BBGLX).


Dollar General is a member of the prestigious [IBD 50 list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full). This is a computer-generated watchlist of market-leading growth stocks, based on earnings and sales growth, return on equity, relative price strength, and other fundamental and technical indicators. DG stock was also previously featured as an [IBD 50 Stock To Watch.](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-dollar-general-near-new-buy-point-coronavirus-boosts-sales/)


Another point in its favor? Dollar General is a leader in the [Retail-Discount & Variety industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jul-10-2020). Among its rivals, **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) rose 2.2%, **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) added 0.7%, **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) lost 0.8%, and **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) added 3%.


Analyst Salutes Dollar General
------------------------------


Jefferies analyst Christopher Madeville is bullish on Dollar General stock, rating it as a buy with a 212 target. While he sees sales moderation ahead as competitors reopen and stimulus tapers, he believes tailwinds such as lower gas prices will "help sustain outsized sales results for the coming months." He also sees potential for more buybacks, which could further bolster the stock price.


"With more than $1 billion left on its program, more than $2.6 billion in cash post recent $1.5 billion debt raise to fortify the balance sheet, and given continued strength quarter to date, we'd expect buyback to potentially return with a vengeance in 2Q20," he said in a May 31 research note.


He also said that the coronavirus pandemic has made its core customer more receptive to tech efforts such as smart lockers and self-checkout. He believes this could be an area of investment for the company.

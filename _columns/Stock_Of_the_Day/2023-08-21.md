**EQT** ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the natural gas producer broke out past a buy point with U.S. natural gas prices spiking on an expected demand increase. EQT stock advanced Monday.




U.S. natural gas futures jumped 3% Monday, hovering around $2.62 per million British thermal units, pressured by hotter-than-usual weather and the threat of a production strike in Australia. U.S. natural gas prices are down around 60% from the same time last year when futures spiked to 14-year highs as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked fears of an energy crisis in Europe.


EQT, headquartered in Pittsburgh, is one of the world's largest natural gas producers. EQT focuses its natural gas production operations in the Marcellus and Utica shales, which are located in the Appalachian basin. EQT operations are primarily in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, with smaller holdings in Ohio.


On July 25, EQT topped Wall Street's Q2 estimates, reporting a better-than-expected loss and revenue. The loss broke a string of nine straight quarterly profits for the company. EQT's total natural gas sales fell to $913 million for the quarter, compared with $1.43 billion a year earlier, on lower volumes and prices.


However, EQT Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Knop told analysts in July that the company's liquefied natural gas (LNG) business performance "remained strong as Europe and China listed U.S. cargoes to refill storage and meet demand from record-breaking heat realized in May and June."


Knop added that LNG capacity increases continuing through 2025 "should create a significant tailwind for natural gas fundamentals over the next several years."

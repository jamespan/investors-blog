The study called RewindÂ assessed whether Trulicity could prevent cardiovascular events regardless of whether the diabetes patients had established cardiovascular disease. The test assessed a limited number of people with established cardiovascular disease.


Trulicity belongs to a class of diabetes treatments called GLP-1 receptor agonists. The study followed patients for more than five years, at the median. That's the longest follow-up period for a cardiovascular test among GLP-1 receptor agonists, Lilly said in a release.


"Millions of people with type 2 diabetes face a high risk for cardiovascular disease," Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA President Enrique Conterno said in a written statement. "These data further validate Trulicity as a well-established option for people with type 2 diabetes."


On Nov. 6, Lilly said [third-quarter Trulicity sales](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-delivers-solid-third-quarter-2018-results-revises-eps) grew a whopping 55%. [Basaglar and Jardiance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-earnings-mallinckrodt-earnings-eli-lilly-stock/), fellow diabetes treatments, also grew a respective 38% and 31% during the third quarter. Though Humalog and Trajenta slipped 5% and 12%, respectively.


Lilly Aims At Migraine Prevention
---------------------------------


CFRA analyst Colin Scarola raised his price target on Lilly stock to 102 from 95 after the third-quarter report. He also sees promise for Lilly's newer drugs, including a migraine prevention [drug called Emgality](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-migraine-prevention-cgrp/), and a pancreatic cancer treatment.


Emgality aims to prevent migraines by targeting a peptide called CGRP. It joins drugs from **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN))/**Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) and **Teva Pharmaceutical** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)), which launched earlier in 2018. **Alder Biopharmaceuticals** ([ALDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALDR)) also is working on a rival drug.


"We think (Emgality) will be competitive with several new migraine drugs approved this year," Scarola said in a note to clients.


In pancreatic cancer, Lilly is working on a Phase 3 drug called pegilodecakin, which it grabbed in June via its [acquisition of Armo Biosciences](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-completes-acquisition-armo-biosciences). Pegilodecakin belongs to a class of drugs that affect the immune system, called immunotherapy.


Scarola says pegilodecakin "has promise as an orphan drug for pancreatic cancer."


Lilly Stock Grabs High Ratings
------------------------------


Lilly stock also has high ratings from Investor's Business Daily. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. That puts Lilly stock in the top 4% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Further, Lilly stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 94 out of a total 99. The RS rating measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the market.

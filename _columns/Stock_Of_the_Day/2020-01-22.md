Although the use of e-commerce in Latin America is relatively low compared with other more developed regions, it's growing fast, providing a big market opportunity for MercadoLibre.


In March, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) made a [$750 million investment in MercadoLibre](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-paypal-stake-mercadolibre-stock/). It was part of a secondary offering that raised $2 billion. The proceeds were used for the expansion of MercadoLibre's various e-commerce platforms, to strengthen its logistics infrastructure, and to solidify its position as a provider of end-to-end financial technology and payments solutions.


The financial technology unit of MercadoLibre is called MercadoPago. It faces competition in digital payments from Brazil-based **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), which held an initial public offering in January 2018 [that raised $2.3 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/brazils-pagseguro-digital-raises-2-3-billion-with-ipo-as-stock-jumps/).

MercadoLibre Earnings
---------------------


The MercadoLibre earnings report on Oct. 31 was mixed. The e-commerce giant lost an adjusted 95 cents per share, far worse than expected, as the company invests heavily on infrastructure and marketing.


But revenue jumped 70% to $603 million, the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth.


Gross merchandise volume hit $3.6 billion, up 37% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis from the year-ago period. Total payment volume through MercadoPago reached $7.6 billion, up 95% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis.


"As we move into the fourth quarter and 2020, we will continue to focus on delivering an ever-improving user experience, adding functionalities to our user base and leveraging our ecosystem's unique competitive advantages," said CFO Pedro Arnt in written remarks.


MercadoLibre earnings for fiscal Q4 are due on Feb. 10. Analysts expect continued losses, with more red ink in 2020.


Piper Sandler analyst Michael Olsen on Wednesday raised his MercadoLibre stock price target to 750 from 675, keeping his overweight rating.


"We remain confident in the company's ability to drive growth, and eventually opex (operating expense) leverage, from investments in payments and logistics. Specifically, we are optimistic regarding overall top-line trends," Olsen wrote.

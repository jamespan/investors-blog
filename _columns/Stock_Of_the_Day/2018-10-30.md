Help From Precision Medicine
----------------------------


Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro says Genomic Health is benefiting from the drug industry's [move toward precision medicine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/new-cancer-treatments-precision-medicine/). In September, he maintained his buy rating on Genomic Health stock and boosted his price target to 70 from 62.


"Genomic Health is now enjoying the fruit of its hard labor," he said in a recent report. "And the fruit is coming from a variety of baskets."


A clinical study this summer showed the benefit of monitoring breast cancer patients. Since June, Genomic Health had seen increases in volume of its Oncotype DX, Massaro said in mid-September. Oncotype DX tests for breast cancer recurrence.


"We believe Genomic Health is positioned to further penetrate both the U.S. and outside the U.S. breast cancer treatment monitoring market opportunity with its flagship Oncotype DX breast cancer recurrence score test," he said.


Third-Quarter Earnings Coming Up
--------------------------------


Potential near-term catalysts include [Genomic Health's third-quarter earnings](http://investor.genomichealth.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1080335), set for Nov. 6. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for Genomic Health to report adjusted profit of 7 cents a share on $94 million in sales.


On a year-over-year basis, sales would rise 12.1%, growing by double digits for the third straight period. Adjusted profit would climb from a 6-cent loss. [Genomic Health's adjusted earnings](http://investor.genomichealth.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=1073928) were in the black in the second quarter, the firm said in a news release.


Year to date, Genomic Health stock has climbed 92%, despite the broad pullback for [medical products stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-technology-acquisitions-spree/) in October. Medical products stocks, ranked No. 12 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily, have risen nearly 20% this year.


Genomic Health is the best-rated [medical product stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/), with best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) and [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99.

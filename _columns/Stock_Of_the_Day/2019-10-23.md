**Federal Signal** ([FSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSS)), a maker of specialty vehicles and security systems for municipalities and industrial customers, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Federal Signal earnings growth has been strong with its next report on tap. The relative strength line is already at highs with Federal Signal stock just below a buy point in a bullish base-on-base pattern.




On a day that **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), another Illinois-based maker of excavators, had a huge earnings miss and said it's reining in production plans, it's worth looking at Federal Signal stock. The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company has been ramping up capital spending, partly to meet unfilled demand for its vacuum excavation equipment.


Federal Signal stock is a member of the market-leading [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list.


The company manufactures sewer cleaners, vacuum trucks, hydro-excavation trucks, street sweepers, water blasters, dump truck bodies, trailers and safety and security systems. Its businesses fall under two main groups: environmental solutions, and safety and security systems.


Federal Signal earnings are due before the opening bell on Oct. 31. Keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports. You can minimize your risk by waiting to see how the company reports and how the market reacts. Another way to minimize the risk of a post-earnings sell-off is to use an [options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/).



Federal Signal Stock Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares slipped 0.2% to 33.49 in Wednesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Federal Signal stock is 2% below a 34.22 buy point from a flat base, according to a MarketSmith analysis. Because latest consolidation formed just on top of the prior consolidation, it is known as a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/).


In weak or choppy markets, this pattern is bullish, because the stock is managing to break out and set up again even as the broader market moves sideways or lower. That suggests the stock may be a leader when market conditions improve.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Federal Signal stock confirms this. It's at a new high before shares have broken out, an especially bullish signal.


IBD Stock Checkup shows that Federal Signal has an excellent 97 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which reflects earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.


Federal Signal Earnings
-----------------------


Wall Street analysts expect Federal Signal earnings per share for the third quarter to rise 17% to 42 cents. Revenue is seen growing 14% to $308.27 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Federal Signal has a solid 87 EPS Rating, meaning earnings performance exceeds 87% of all companies.


After lackluster results in 2016, Federal Signal earnings growth shot up, but EPS gains have slowed in the past two quarters and are expected to do so again.


Analysts expect that trend to continue. Current estimates point to about 7% sales growth and 13% EPS growth in 2020.


That decelerating trajectory doesn't match up to typical winning growth stocks. But not many companies are delivering accelerating growth right now.


Federal Signal has stood out for its combination of growth and defensive qualities. Of the $1.17 billion in orders last year, 31% were from U.S. municipal and governmental customers, 47% were from U.S. commercial and industrial customers and 22% were from non-U.S. customers. The broad exposure to government purchasers, both in the U.S. and abroad, tends to lower volatility.


In May, Federal Signal announced a $55 million deal for Mark Rite Lines Equipment. Mark Rite makes truck-mounted and ride-on road-marking equipment.


It's also expanding production and working on reducing its order backlog, particularly for sewer cleaners and vacuum trucks. "With current lead times for vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners continuing to be extended, orders received in the second quarter and beyond may not translate to revenue and income during 2019," CEO Jennifer Sherman said.

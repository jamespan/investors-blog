**Eldorado Resorts** ([ERI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the casino operator swings between two possible buy points following earnings late Wednesday. Eldorado stock, which has seen increased institutional sponsorship, rose Thursday but pulled back from a record high.




Reno-based Eldorado Resorts has been aggressively expanding via M&A, going from three properties in 2013 to 27 properties in 13 states today. Eldorado also installed Thomas Regg as CEO in January, moving up from president and CFO.


Its rapid growth has caught the eye of institutional investors, with many putting their chips on the table to secure a stake. In Q4, 79 funds opened positions in El Dorado stock while 172 increased their stake and 141 cashed out some of their stock. One noteworthy buyer was the Fidelity OTC Fund, which added 300,000 shares. Such activity is important to the canny [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) connoisseur, as the I in the acronym stands for Institutional Sponsorship.


**Eldorado** Stock Technical Analysis
-------------------------------------


Shares rose 1.5% to 48.21 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), pulling back from the morning's all-time high of 50.97. At that high, Eldorado stock briefly cleared an alternate entry of 50.74, just above the left side of its consolidation. Eldorado stock previously broke from a 17-week [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base buy point of 45.68 on Jan. 31, [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows. The 5% chase zone for that entry runs to 47.96. So, technically, Eldorado is between two buy zones but is not in either one.



Investors may want to wait for Eldorado stock to move above that 50.97 intraday high.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is a bullish indicator for Eldorado stock. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been on a generally upward trend, and just hit an all-time high.

Eldorado stock only has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 70. The reason is a lumpy Eldorado earnings track record amid the M&A frenzy. Wednesday's Q4 report was murky. The casino operator just broke even. It's unclear if those results are comparable to estimates for 37 cents a share.


Eldorado Resorts holds a lackluster [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 52. But Eldorado earnings are expected to increase by 150% in 2019.


Analyst Bets Big On Gaming Stock
--------------------------------


Union Gaming analyst John DeCree said Eldorado Resorts beat his Q4 expectations "by a wide margin." He reiterated his buy rating on Eldorado stock, pointing to the synergy opportunities ahead.


"Management cited that it already achieved (around) $30m of the $40m in target synergies with the Tropicana acquisition and about $10m of the $15m in target synergies at Grand Victoria. The company said all announced synergies will be realized by the middle of the year and (it) expects to exceed those targets over time," the analyst said in a research note. "The cost rationalization opportunity across the portfolio, coupled with favorable macroeconomic tailwinds such as consumer confidence, wage growth, and employment, point to a favorable outlook for 2019 and into 2020."


He said other catalysts ahead for Eldorado include planned developments and sports betting initiatives with William Hill and **The Stars Group** ([TSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSG)).


More Eldorado M&A?
------------------


While DeCree's investment thesis does not rely on the gaming stock seeking further mergers, he does see opportunities ahead. Management is bullish on this front.


"We think we are pretty good at buying assets that other people are running," CEO Reeg said during the firm's Q4 earnings call. "We are going to remain active [buying companies], and you should expect us to remain active."

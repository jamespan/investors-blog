**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity software provider nears a buy point. But while it's part of a leading group and sector, Fortinet stock itself is lagging some of its rivals.




Fortinet stock has formed a [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-basics-analyze-both-daily-weekly-stock-charts/) with an 88.70 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The cybersecurity firm touts a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99. Fortinet stock fell 1.3% to 83.26 in Friday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/).



Fortinet stock is part of the Computer-Software Security group, ranked No. 8 out of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-14-2019/). Software generally is the top-performing sector right now. **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) also sport CR Ratings of 99. (Learn more about the cybersecurity stocks at [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).)


CyberArk stock and Zscaler stock, both on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), have skyrocketed in the current stock market rally. Proofpoint stock and Palo Alto stock are in buy zones.

Fortinet Earnings Guidance Light
--------------------------------


Fortinet earnings and revenue topped Q4 estimates last month. But the company guided low on Q1 and 2019 profit and billings.


After falling the session after its earnings report, Fortinet stock soon rallied on expected growth from new products and the strategy to move up-market.


Fortinet Competes In Firewall Market
------------------------------------


Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Fortinet competes in the firewall market vs. Palo Alto, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), and **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)). Firewalls are the biggest part of the cybersecurity software market. But other [cybersecurity products](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/) are growing faster.


Firewalls protect computer networks by blocking online intrusions and monitoring web-based apps.


Analysts say Fortinet has been gaining share.


In the December quarter, Fortinet signed 47 deals with a contract value of more than $1 million, up from 40 deals a year earlier.


Fortinet has targeted the high end of the firewall market with new products.


The company has focused on rolling out next-generation firewall products that support the Secure Sockets Layer standard. It also aims to win contracts with bigger companies. Telecom service providers account for about a fifth of revenue.


Fortinet Well-Positioned For SD-WAN
-----------------------------------


Analysts say Fortinet seems well-positioned as corporate buyers shift to networking technology called software-defined wide-area networking, or SD-WAN. The technology often taps bandwidth on the public internet.


With SD-WAN, companies have less need for costly private data networks leased from telecom companies. But along with the SD-WAN savings comes an increased security risk from data going over the public internet.


Fortinet Earnings Growth Cooling
--------------------------------


Analysts now see Fortinet earnings rising 13% in 2019 and 2020. Those are decent numbers, but well below its three-year EPS growth rate of 52% and far less than those of peers such as Zscaler and CyberArk. Fortinet forecast 15% revenue growth this year vs. 19% in 2018.


Fortinet Stock Sell Strategy
----------------------------


If Fortinet stock climbs into a buy zone, investors might consider having a price target in mind — say a 20% gain — for selling, because it's less likely to be a huge winner.

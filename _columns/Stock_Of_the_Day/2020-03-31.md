"We support them not only through our subscription-based research and discovery products, but also through bespoke consulting and professional services engagements."

Clarivate provides intellectual property and scientific information. It uses curated and proprietary databases to support its efforts.

The stock has a healthy [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Clarivate stock currently outperforms 79% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


Clarivate stock also is demonstrating characteristics critical in a down market.

In addition, the stock has a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 96. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.

Clarivate's Leadership Position
-------------------------------


"We like Clarivate's leadership position, business model, and attractive growth strategy," Weber wrote in a note to clients in January. He expects Clarivate to show improvements in revenue, adjusted earnings and cash flow over the next several years.


In 2019, it reported revenue of $974.3 million, vs. $968.5 million in the prior year, with a 2019 net loss of $211 million. It has a market capitalization of about $7.5 billion.


Clarivate expects 2020 revenue in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.19 billion. That's up from prior estimates of $950 million to $970 million.


The company's structure consists of two business units, one focused on science and the other on intellectual property. It claims to have the No. 1 or No. 2 global position across key offerings.


Operations In London, Philadelphia
----------------------------------


Its primary headquarters is in London, with its U.S. operations based in Philadelphia. The company was carved out of Thomson Reuters in October 2016. Among its dealings since then are various restructurings and acquisitions.


Early this month it completed a $950 million acquisition of Decision Resources Group. DRG provides data, analytics and other products and services to the health care industry.


The acquisition more than doubled the size of Clarivate's life science analytics business. It estimates that business at a $19 billion market, currently expected to grow over the next three years at 12% a year.

**Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares approach a buy point amid bullish calls for its experimental eye disease treatment. Horizon stock was up in Thursday trades.




Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore says the drug, now dubbed teprotumumab, ultimately may add more than $500 million to Horizon's top line. He expects it to become the standard-of-care for patients with [thyroid eye disease](https://www.thyroid.org/graves-eye-disease/), which causes the eyes to protrude from the socket.


Horizon Chief Executive Tim Walbert was even more bullish in a [November interview with Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/horizon-stock-gout-treatment-eye-disease/), suggesting the treatment for the drug could generate $750 million in peak sales annually.


The [highly rated pharma stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/best-pharmaceutical-stocks-to-buy/) is also known for Krystexxa, which treats chronic gout.

"We believe the leverage from the orphan portfolio will become significantly more evident in 2019-20 as Krystexxa continues to gain traction and is augmented by teprotumumab," Cowen's Cacciatore said in a recent report to clients.


Horizon Stock Ranks High
------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Horizon [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) advanced 2.4%, to 21.49. Shares are creeping up on a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 22.76 out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Horizon stock has high ratings from IBD. The pharma stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) of 96, meaning it trades in the top 4% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Shares lead the industry group of [pharma stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/).


Shares also have a high [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating tracks a stock's performance against all others over a 12-month period. Horizon stock also appears on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of elite growth stocks.


Those metrics could improve with [fourth-quarter earnings](http://ir.horizon-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/horizon-pharma-plc-release-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2018), set for Feb. 27. The average of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research is for adjusted income of 54 cents a share on $333 million in sales, rising a respective 86.2% and 21.4% year over year.


Cowen's Cacciatore expects Horizon to meet other estimates for $334 million in revenue and 54 cents in adjusted earnings per share. He expects $85 million in Krystexxa sales, an increase of 93% vs. the year-ago period. He sees $260 million in full-year Krystexxa sales.


"The bottom line is that the balance sheet is healthy, the core operations driven by Krystexxa are strengthening, and we believe the development pipeline led by teprotumumab is still being meaningfully undervalued," he said.



Krystexxa Sales Could Ramp More
-------------------------------


Horizon could expand Krystexxa sales. It's currently testing Krystexxa plus methotrexate, an immune-system-suppressing drug that belongs to the chemotherapy class. The hope is that methotrexate can cut down on Krystexxa's immune-system side effects.


Cacciatore says Krystexxa is "severely underpenetrated" in the chronic gout market. If new studies pan out testing Krystexxa plus methotrexate, it's possible Horizon could expand the number of Krystexxa vials per patient, and potentially add new patients, he said.


"These improvements would clearly increase, if not accelerate, the market potential," he said.


Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem notes that Horizon is facing off against **Selecta Biosciences** ([SELB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SELB)), which is testing a [chronic gout drug called SEL-212](https://selectabio.com/pipeline/chronic-severe-gout/). Selecta is moving the drug into a Phase 3 study vs. a placebo and into a head-to-head test against Krystexxa.


In the latter test, Selecta will study the effects of SEL-212 against Krystexxa without adding methotrexate, Amsellem said in a recent note. This is in line with the [label for Krystexxa](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/125293s085lbl.pdf). But Amsellem says this glosses over "what is clearly an evolving view of how to use Krystexxa."


Further, the study of Krystexxa plus methotrexate is likely to set a high bar in effectiveness, he said.

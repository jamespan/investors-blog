Analyst Balanced On HD Supply Stock
-----------------------------------


RBC Capital Markets managing director Deane Dray raised his price target from 44 to 46 after the stock narrowly beat on earnings and revenue in December. However, he said its valuation is "relatively balanced" and rates it as market perform.


"HD Supply sounded particularly positive on nonresidential activity and cited a multitude of multibillion dollar projects that give them confidence in the market's health," he said in a research note. "Verticals highlighted included airports, entertainment centers, corporate headquarters, data centers, and distribution centers."


Those interested in the top stock should keep their eyes open for Q4 earnings on March 19. Last quarter management raised sales guidance for fiscal 2018 to $5.98 billion-$6.03 billion from $5.9 billion-$6 billion and lifted its full-year EPS outlook to $3.33-$3.38 from $3.22-$3.35.

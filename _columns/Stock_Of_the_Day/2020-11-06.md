**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the graphics-chip maker hit a buy point ahead of its third-quarter earnings report due in less than two weeks. Nvidia stock was on track to rise for a fifth straight day on Friday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Nvidia stock climbed 2.8% to close at 582.48. Over the past nine weeks, Nvidia stock had formed a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 574.04, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


Aggressive investors could have purchased shares on Wednesday as Nvidia stock popped above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) and bucked a downward sloping trend.


However, [buying a stock ahead of its quarterly earnings report](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/should-you-buy-stock-ahead-of-earnings/) can be risky.

Nvidia Earnings Report Due Nov. 18
----------------------------------


Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia plans to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on Nov. 18. Wall Street analysts expect the company to earn $2.56 a share on sales of $4.41 billion. In the year-earlier period, Nvidia earnings were $1.78 a share on sales of $3.01 billion.


Nvidia has benefited lately from strong sales of graphics processors for gaming PCs and data centers. It also is providing a custom processor for **Nintendo**'s ([NTDOY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTDOY)) Switch video game console, which is likely to be a hot-selling product this holiday season.


One overhang on Nvidia stock is its [planned acquisition of chip designer Arm](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-rises-deal-to-buy-arm/) from Japan's **SoftBank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)). The $40 billion cash-and-stock deal, announced Sept. 13, faces significant regulatory hurdles, particularly in China.


With the purchase of Arm, Nvidia intends to move deeper into data centers with central processing units for servers. The move would challenge **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) in the market for server CPUs.


Nvidia Stock Tied For First Place In Industry Group
---------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Nvidia faces heightened competition from AMD in graphics processors.


On Oct. 28, AMD showed off its latest graphics processors to compete with Nvidia. The AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards promise world-class 4K resolution performance for top PC game titles.


Nvidia stock is tied for first place among 31 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-corp-nvda.aspx) tool.


AMD, **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and Nvidia each have a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


The fabless chipmaker group ranks No. 14 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Growth stock investors should focus on leading stocks in top 40 industry groups.


Nvidia stock also has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96 out of 99. The rating shows how a stock's price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the past 52 weeks.

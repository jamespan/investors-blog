Goldman Sachs is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the investment banking giant clears a base, amid a broader upswing among bank stocks as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.




The move higher for **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) comes as the spread between short- and longer-term Treasury yields — or rates of return on government debt — got steeper Tuesday. The broader stock also market rose on Tuesday, helped by [solid manufacturing data for May](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-today-leads-futures-rise-ahead-of-pmi-data-oil-prices-surge-ev-makers-xpeng-nio-rally-on-may-deliveries/).


Following the release of the Institute for Supply Management's monthly manufacturing gauge, which increased in May, the spread between the two- and 10-year yields hit the widest since May 21. Similarly, the spread between the five- and 30-year yields also hit the highest since May 21.


A steeper spread allows banks to borrow at lower rates and lend at higher rates, boosting earnings. Banks borrow on the short end of those yields and lend on the long end.


Fears of hotter inflation and wages have put upward pressure on longer-term yields. The Federal Reserve's beige book report Wednesday and the Labor Department's jobs report on Friday should provide more clues on inflation.

Shares are currently sitting at a new high.


The stock has a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99.

Goldman Sachs in April reported first-quarter results that [crushed analysts estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-wells-fargo-earnings-q1-2021/). RBC analysts at the time said Goldman "continues to benefit from strong Trading and Investment Banking conditions with impressive 1Q21 results."


"We expect GS to continue to drive its business model to be customer-centric, which should allow it to maintain its top-tier position as a 'go-to' global investment bank," they continued.


CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon, who also covers Goldman Sachs stock, wrote in April that the bank was "executing on all cylinders with industry leading performance, and we believe the capital markets will remain very active in a low rate, risk-on environment from corporate issuers, M&A, and investors."


However, some Federal Reserve policymakers have recently indicated they could pull back on measures to prop up the economy if the recovery continues.

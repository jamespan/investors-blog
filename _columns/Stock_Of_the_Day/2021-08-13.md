**Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Greek container ship company capitalizes on today's high shipping rates to set itself up for long-term profitability. DAC stock also looks to be setting up for a new breakout.




Shipping rates surged amid strong demand for electronics, furniture, bicycles and other goods as consumers rode out the pandemic close to home. Delays due to overburdened ports — and Covid-related disruptions like the one that hit China's second-largest container port this week — have further stretched industry capacity.


DAC Stock
---------


Shares fell 1.3% to 71.07 on the [stock market today](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). That's about 10% below a 79.59 cup buy point from a 7-week base, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


DAC stock has a 99 Relative Strength Rating, meaning it has outperformed 99% of all stocks over the past year.


Despite its massive run-up of about 2,000% since July 2020, DAC stock's technical picture looks to be on pretty firm ground. DAC stock has retaken its 50-day moving average, after dipping below the key technical signpost last month for the first time in a year.


DAC stock could be etching out a handle on the end of its cup pattern, but it will take to Wednesday to find out.


Keep in mind that shipping stocks run both hot and cold, often for long periods. The Transportation-Ship industry group had a great run from 2002 to 2007. But it then lagged the S&P 500 for most of the ensuing 14 years, before taking off last summer.


The industry group is ranked No. 25 out of 197 based on price performance and momentum. Now, DAC stock, along with other industry group leaders, could be getting a new head of steam.


Danaos Has 'Strong Leverage'
----------------------------


On Aug. 2, Danaos reported Q2 EPS growth of 95% to $3.34 as revenue grew at an accelerated 25% pace to $146.4 million.


"The market appears to be in short supply until at least the end of next year, and we have strong leverage to this dynamic," CEO John Coustas said in a statement.


New charter agreements are running from 3 to 5 years, meaning the benefits from current prices will be long-lasting. Plus, some of these charters won't even begin until the middle of 2022.


But there's more good news. On July 1, Danaos said it had exercised an option to buy the 49% stake in Gemini Shipholdings that it didn't already own. The deal for the rest of Gemini and its five container ships will provide an immediate lift to results. Further, Danaos said it acquired six additional relatively modern and eco-friendly ships that it expects to charter at higher rates once current terms expire in 2022-2024.


ZIM Stock Stake
---------------


Beyond the fundamental backdrop, there's been one extra engine driving Danaos: the rising value of its stake in **Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) stock.


Danaos recorded a $196-million gain related to its interest in ZIM stock, which had an IPO in January. Danaos, after selling 2 million shares for $76 million, still owns about 8.2 million shares. Danaos received the stake when the Israeli shipping firm, a charter customer, restructured in 2014.


Danaos also went through some rough seas amid the global financial crisis. DAC stock, while riding high now, has only returned to 2015 levels and remains well off its 2007 peak.


Danaos now has a stake in ZIM stock worth about $367 million. Meanwhile, DAC stock has a market cap of about $1.5 billion.


ZIM stock, which has earnings due on Wednesday morning, is about 11% below a 50.00 cup buy point.


**Maston** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)), which provides transport services across the Pacific Ocean, is 8% below a 79.15 buy point.


**Textainer Group** ([TGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGH)), which leases shipping containers and is in the Commercial Services-Leasing group, rose past a 36.29 buy point on Wednesday, though it has since slipped out of buy range.

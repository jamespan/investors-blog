**RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after triggering a new buy signal. RH stock shot up on the news legendary investor Warren Buffett has taken a new position in the luxury furniture chain.




Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) disclosed late Thursday that it bought 1.2 million shares of RH stock worth around $206 million. Berkshire disclosed the RH stock stake in its latest quarterly 13F filing with the SEC, in which it also disclosed reduced stakes in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)).


Individual investors use the regulatory data to gauge where the "smart money" is placing its bets. Note that 13F filings show holdings at the end of each quarter, and hedge funds may have made changes to stock positions since then.


As other retailers try to figure out how to operate in the digital world carved out by **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), RH has doubled down on brick and mortar. Its upscale physical retail spaces — sometimes with their own restaurants — are complemented by thick print catalogs that offer enticing images of its merchandise to customers.


Last month it dazzled investors with the opening of RH Minneapolis, a three-level store with glass-encased rooftop eatery and a landscaped park. At the last count the firm operated a total of 70 RH Galleries and 40 RH outlet stores.

RH stock hit an intraday high of 190.50. Investors might wait until it clears that level before taking a position.


It's also possible that RH will form a new base with a 192.10 buy point, but it would need a few more weeks of consolidation to do that.


RH stock jumped last month after the premium furniture chain reported that second-quarter results topped earnings expectations, helped by sales at its palatial store in New York. The retailer also hiked its full-year financial forecast yet again.


RH earnings rose 59%, following a 53% gain in the prior quarter. Sales growth accelerated for a second straight quarter, to 10%.


RH stock has a perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 and a very strong [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97. The stock's relative strength line has risen since June, indicating outperformance of the S&P 500, which has been choppy this summer.



Warren Buffett Also Does This
-----------------------------


In addition to RH, the Warren Buffett-run company also snapped up 7.5 million shares of **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) worth around $332 million. The positions each account for roughly 0.1% of portfolio assets.


Earlier this year, Berkshire Hathaway invested $10 billion in Occidental to help secure funding for its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.


The 13F filings also showed Berkshire Hathaway lowered its stake in Wells Fargo stock by 7%, in **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)) by 6% and in **Sirius XM** ([SIRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIRI)) by 1%.


Warren Buffett also slightly trimmed his Apple stock holdings. But Apple stock rallied 1.2% as it got two new price target hikes. Apple stock, like RH stock, is on IBD Leaderboard.

Casino games maker **Light & Wonder** ([LNW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNW)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Monday. LNW stock is rebounding from a key level toward a buy point, while already flashing bullish relative strength.




Las Vegas-based Light & Wonder makes a variety of casino games and iGaming apps, as well as provides a range of gambling products and services. Along with slot machines, table games and electronic casino games, Light & Wonder offers shufflers, chip sorters, electronic displays, payment solutions and other casino-related necessities.


On Monday, Light & Wonder announced it acquired the remaining 17% equity interest in mobile gambling game creator SciPlay for $22.95 per share in cash.


SciPlay will now operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Light & Wonder. SCPL stock no longer trades on the Nasdaq as of Monday. Light & Wonder reported the deal in early August. The $22.95 per share price was a slight increase from the $20 per share offer in May for $422 million. That proposal implied a total enterprise value of $2.1 billion for SciPlay.


Meanwhile, Light & Wonder is scheduled to report Q3 results on Nov. 9. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings to rocket 228% to 46 cents per share adjusted, marking three consecutive quarters of triple-digit gains. Wall Street forecasts 10.3% revenue growth to $715 million, slowing after two quarters of accelerating growth.


Casino Stocks Climb
-------------------


Casino stocks have been struggling, but climbed late last week after **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) noted [strong recovery at its Macao and Singapore resorts](https://www.investors.com/news/casino-stocks-spark-higher-as-macau-comes-to-life/) during its Q3 earnings call Wednesday. Las Vegas Sands reported a 215% spike in casino revenues to just over $2 billion for the quarter, compared to $637 million in 2022.


LVS stock added 1.2% last week after paring gains Friday. Shares gained 3.3% on Monday.


**Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) rallied 3.9% Monday after HSBC initiated coverage of WYNN stock with a buy rating and $111 price target. HSBC initiated coverage on a variety of casino and hotel stocks.


Elsewhere, sports betting platform and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) member **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) is consolidating with a 34.49 buy point, jumping 4.8% to 28.36 on Monday. DKNG stock fell below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages last week after being named the [IBD Stock Of The Day for Oct. 11](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/draftkings-stock-flirts-with-new-buy-signal-after-167-percent-rally-on-sports-betting-boom/). Shares rallied nearly 149% in 2023. Meanwhile, **ARK Invest** ([ARKK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARKK)) CEO Cathie Wood steadily sold shares throughout September.


LNW Stock
---------



LNW stock rose to 74.84 Monday, bouncing off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Shares are trading in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 79.06 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) according to MarketSmith. Investors could view 77.25 as an early entry, but the market correction and Light & Wonder's upcoming earnings raise the risks.


However, [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) data shows volume on the stock is fairly low and down 50% from its typical levels so far this week, which is something investors will want to consider as it could hamper any advance.


Light & Wonder's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is already at a new high, a bullish sign. That RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


LNW stock has a 94 RS Rating out of a best-possible 99. The strong [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) means the casino game maker outperformed 94% of all stocks in the IBD database over the past year.


Shares have an 81 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/). LNW stock has an 81 Composite Rating. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) combines various technical indicators into one easy-to-read score.


LNW stock rallied roughly 28% in 2023. Shares are not too far off their all-time high of 90.20 from late October 2021.

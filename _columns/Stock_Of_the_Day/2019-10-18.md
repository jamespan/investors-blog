**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the robotic surgery giant breaks out on a massive earnings beat.




Shares of the robotic surgery company popped 7% to close at 566.25 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Intuitive Surgical [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) surged in high [volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/) above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 549.10 out of a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) base that began forming in July.

Procedures using Intuitive Surgical's flagship product, da Vinci, grew 20%. That lent itself to a 47-cent earnings beat. But analysts were conflicted on the report. The [robotic surgery giant](http://isrg.intuitive.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intuitive-announces-third-quarter-earnings) shipped fewer systems in the U.S., indicating a potentially troubling trend.

Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar says he's struggling with Intuitive Surgical stock.


"On the one hand, we admire the company for having created a new growth vertical in [medtech](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/) and demonstrating technology leadership," he said in a note to clients. "On the other hand, we think revenues are likely to decelerate from the stellar 2019 levels."


Intuitive Surgical Stock Bounds Higher On Beat
----------------------------------------------


During the [third quarter, Intuitive Surgical](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intuitive-surgical-stock-robotic-surgery-q3-2019/) earned $3.43 per share, on an adjusted basis, beating the estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment research for $2.96 a share. Earnings jumped 21% year over year.


Sales grew 23% to $1.13 billion, above forecasts for $1.06 billion. Sales from instruments and accessories to be used with Intuitive Surgical's [robotic surgery](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/robotic-surgery-companies-medical-technology/) systems accounted for nearly 54% of total revenue, at $606 million.


Instrument and accessory sales jumped 25%. Evercore ISI's Kumar noted a continuing trend of higher instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. Importantly, U.S. general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures are still growing.


Both trends should help drive revenue growth, Kumar said.



U.S. System Placements Lag Estimates
------------------------------------


But Intuitive Surgical placed only 185 robotic surgery systems in the U.S. That lagged views for 190, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry said in a report. Internationally, the company shipped 90 systems, a hair above expectations for 89.


Evercore ISI's Kumar described placements in Europe as "anemic."


"Turning to 2020, if these trends continue, modeling systems placements could be tricky (as upside from China quota could be partly offset by Japan, which benefited from incremental reimbursement in 2019)," he said.


On a positive note, the average sales price of systems was $1.57 million in the third quarter, above RBC analyst Henry's estimate for $1.42 million.


Robotic Surgery Giant Raises Outlook
------------------------------------


The robotic surgery giant now forecasts 17%-18% growth in procedures using its da Vinci system. That's north of earlier projections for 16%-17% procedure growth, Henry said. He had forecast 17% growth.


But Intuitive Surgical noted a setback for its single-port robotic surgery system. The Food and Drug Administration is requiring a clinical study before approving its use in colorectal conditions, RBC's Henry said. This could push approval to 2021.


"Intuitive Surgical should be able to manage through this and we note that system demand remained strong in the third quarter with 12% year-over-year growth in the installed base," he said.


Henry kept his sector perform rating on Intuitive Surgical stock. He raised his price target to 570 from 550. Evercore ISI's Kumar also boosted his price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to 540 from 530.


Mixed Ratings For This Medical Stock
------------------------------------


Intuitive Surgical stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 92 from Investor's Business Daily. The CR measures a stock's key growth metrics. This puts shares of the robotic surgery company in the top 8% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Shares have a middling [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/), however. On a scale of 1-99, Intuitive Surgical stock has an RS Rating of 49, which reflects the stock's yearlong horizontal trading range. So, shares currently rank in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.

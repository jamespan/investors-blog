**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after retaking a key support level as it gets set to activate a new base.




With consistently strong earnings growth amid ongoing international expansion, [Lululemon stock](https://www.investors.com/research/lulu-stock-buy-now/) has caught the eyes of growth stock investors.


The upmarket yogawear maker is continuing to benefit from the ongoing athleisure trend. The Canadian firm is also stretching its limits further by targeting digital sales and expanding into men's clothing.


Lululemon Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------


Shares in the IBD 50 name were up 1.8% at 186.06 on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Lululemon stock has flashed a bullish sign by mounting its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), albeit in light volume. Nevertheless, this is good news for those watching the stock, especially as [MarketSmith analysis shows it will form a new flat base on Friday](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). And stocks that form bases above the 50-day average have better odds of succeeding. The correct entry point will be 194.35.


Rival **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) rose 2.3% Thursday, also retaking its 50-day line. **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) rallied 2.4%, and **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)) edged up 0.5%.

A key indicator on how a stock is performing is the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/). This is another bullish indicator for Lululemon stock, as it is currently near its all-time high.


The [IBD Composite Rating for Lululemon stock is 95](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), putting it in the elite top 5% of stocks tracked. The [Stock Checkup Tool underlines its quality](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-lululemon-athletica-lulu.aspx). Earnings have been growing at a rapid clip, swelling by an average of 36% over the past three quarters and by 31% over the past three years.


Since hitting its all-time low of 2.17 in March 2009, Lululemon has grown by 8,438%.


There could be more big growth ahead. Management said the firm plans to enter the athletic shoe market, double men's sales and digital sales, and quadruple international sales by 2023 as part of its new five-year growth plan. One potential warning sign emerged in June when it was reported the firm had closed its men's stand-alone stores in New York City and Toronto. But Lululemon insisted customers respond better when Lululemon is offered as a "dual-gender brand."



Bras And Pants Key To Growth
----------------------------


[CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) know good companies must innovate to take advantage, which is why the N in the acronym stands for new products. A big grab for the bra market is afoot at Lululemon, with Chief Product Officer Sun Choe telling analysts ["bras will become as big as pants in years to come"](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-analyst-day-earnings-forecast-china-lululemon-stock/) at the firm's analyst day earlier this year.


However, investors should also be cautious on Lululemon stock at the moment, as earnings are due next Thursday. Wall Street expects earnings per share to rise 25% to 89 cents, with revenue up 17% to $844 million. Both would mark the third straight quarter of deceleration.


Those keen on the stock should note that [IBD has an options strategy that limits risk around earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/). The strategy provides a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings. It also reduces the risk of a negative reaction to an earnings report.


Analyst Cautious On Lululemon Stock
-----------------------------------


Heading into earnings, Wedbush Securities analyst Jen Redding is neutral on Lululemon stock with a 175 price target.


She believes that the potential upside to strength in revenues is offset by a markdown risk due to discounts in men's products. Redding also thinks much of the potential growth is already priced in to Lululemon stock, though she still sees it as a "compelling long-term opportunity."


"We see growth initiatives as reasonable and see levers for continued growth including innovation, financial/channel flexibility, and continued strong cash flow," she said in an Aug. 20 research note. "But (we) remain neutral as we believe that at current valuation (near 52w high and 48x earnings), the market has priced in much of the growth to come."

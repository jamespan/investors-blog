**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is the IBD Stock of the Day as the top payments stock closes in on a buy zone after announcing a new buyback program and a dividend hike.




Mastercard, an [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock, announced late Tuesday it is giving its quarterly dividend a 21% hike to 40 cents per share. In addition, the  New York-based firm's board of directors approved a new $8 billion share repurchase program.


The new buyback program will become active once the firm's current $6.5 billion buyback scheme is completed. It currently has around $300 million left before it is exhausted.


Mastercard Stock Charges Ahead
------------------------------


Shares closed down 0.1% at 286.84 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), inching toward a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 293.79 from a 13-week flat base, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Mastercard stock is up more than 50% so far in 2019 and punched through resistance at the 280 mark last month. It is also currently trading above its 50-day line, which is a bullish indicator.


The relative strength line has been moving sideways lately and is off the highs it reached in early September.


Mastercard stock has an [IBD Composite Rating of 96](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), and the [stock checkup tool shows](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mastercard-inc-cl-a-ma.aspx) it is strong both technically and fundamentally. Mastercard earnings in particular have been strong, with EPS growing by 30% per year over the past three years. This is above the [25% growth looked for by CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Several other payment stocks have been doing well of late. Dow Jones stock **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) was down 0.7% at 180.60 Wednesday though, back below its 182.50 buy point. **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) was up 1.2% at 38.30, and is trying to get back above a 39.59 buy point.


Meanwhile digital payments leader **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) was down 0.6%, while **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) rose 0.6%. Both stocks are building bases.

Analyst Backs Mastercard
------------------------


Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane is bullish on Mastercard stock, rating it as a buy with a price target of 320 in a Nov. 11 research note.


He said that while the firm is dedicated to expanding its card business, it is also working to grow in the mid- to long-term through new opportunities such as real-time payments, B2B, cross-border account-to-account and new applications like bill pay.


"Overall, we believe MA can continue to grow solid low-double-digits top-line (propelling into mid-teens growth), and deliver operating leverage even while investing in future network expansion initiatives, which should drive EPS growth above the high teens, in our view," he wrote last month.

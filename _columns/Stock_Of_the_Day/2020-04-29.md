[IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) has clawed back near a buy point as e-commerce stays resilient amid the global coronavirus lockdown. Still, PayPal stock isn't immune to the Covid-19 emergency as consumers stay at home.




PayPal had plenty of momentum before the coronavirus pandemic hit. One big reason: PayPal has evolved from online checkout to mobile shopping and person-to-person payments.


PayPal added 37.3 million net new active accounts in 2019, bringing total active accounts to 305 million, up 14% year over year. The Venmo person-to-person money-transfer service now has 52 million users. And, the newly acquired Honey Science shopping app has some 17 million monthly online and mobile users.


Chief Executive Dan Schulman at a recent financial conference said the average PayPal customer now uses its online payment button 40 times per year, up from 17 times in 2014 when he joined the company. There's also the fact a worldwide network of more than 24 million merchants do business with PayPal.

PayPal Stock: Online Shopping Jumps For Groceries
-------------------------------------------------


Some analysts say PayPal will weather a recession better than many payment processing companies.


"With little brick and mortar transaction volume and what appears to be surging online buying, we think PayPal's payment volumes are holding up quite well," Canaccord Genuity analyst Joseph Vafi said in a recent report to clients.


Even so, PayPal has exposure to online travel arrangements and entertainment.


UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom warns about accounting rules tied to $4 billion in small business and consumer loans sitting on PayPal's balance sheet. PayPal may need to reserve cash for possible loan losses, which would impact 2020 earnings, he said in an April 27 report.


PayPal stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of 86 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That's higher than other fintech stocks such as **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)).


Relative Strength A Bright Spot For PayPal Stock
------------------------------------------------


Also, PayPal's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is bullish. The relative strength line compares a stock's price performance with that of the S&P 500. An upward-trending RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


PayPal stock trades well above its 10-week moving average. Forming a [cup chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), PayPal stock has approached a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 124.55. Shares jumped 6.4% to close at 123.58 Wednesday.


With first-quarter earnings due on May 6, investors may want to be cautious. One trading strategy for investors heading into company earnings reports is [using call options](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/stock-market-strategies-using-options-around-earnings-helps-minimize-risk/).


Consumers long-term behavior may shift as a result of the coronavirus emergency. Credit card giant **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) today said consumer use of "contactless" payments such as tap-to-pay and mobile pay has surged as people avoid exchanging cash or touching retail terminals.


PayPal could also see a lift from that.


"We believe the merchant and consumer behavior shifts happening as a result of Covid-19 offer PayPal a unique opportunity to gain market share across nearly every facet of its business (PayPal, Braintree, Venmo, Honey)," MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis said in a recent note to clients.


Ellis added: "In our view, whether PayPal capitalizes on these share gain opportunities will determine whether, post-crisis, PayPal's business performance — and likely stock performance — will be good, or spectacular."


Before Covid-19 Outbreak, EBay A Concern
----------------------------------------


PayPal stock, meanwhile, has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus. The rating runs from a best-possible A to a worst-possible E.


The A/D Rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. An improving Accumulation/Distribution Rating would be a sign that institutional buyers are gaining confidence that PayPal can thrive when the coronavirus emergency eases.


Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, investors' biggest worry over PayPal stock was the phaseout of its relationship with former parent **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)). The online marketplace spun out PayPal in 2015.


EBay is shifting payment processing to Netherlands-based **Adyen** ([ADYFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADYFF)) starting in July. PayPal's revenue and gross payment volume will be impacted.


Partners Should Help PayPal
---------------------------


However, bullish PayPal stock analysts say new partners of the company will offset the loss of eBay transactions. They include **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) and others.


PayPal also has made inroads in China, where the coronavirus emergency has eased.


The company on Jan. 22 unveiled an alliance with state-backed China UnionPay. The deal will allow some UnionPay cardholders access to PayPal's network.


In September, China granted PayPal approval to buy a 70% stake in payment firm Gopay Information Technology.

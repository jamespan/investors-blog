**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), after reclaiming a key technical benchmark on Friday and forming a new base with a buy point.




The payment-processing giant is emerging as a leader in B2B payments and is pursuing growth initiatives on three fronts: expansion of its core business, diversifying into new geographies and expanding into new avenues, such as data analytics and consulting.


Meanwhile, the U.S. labor market remains strong, bolstering consumer spending and credit card transactions. And progress on the U.S.-China trade war could lift uncertainty weighing on cross-border payments.


Mastercard Stock Analysis
-------------------------


Shares closed up 0.8% at 275.91 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), making a [bullish move above its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), as did archrival **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). As the trading day ended, Mastercard stock finished forming a new flat base with a 293.79 buy point, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).

The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) of Mastercard stock looks to be regrouping since falling from an all-time high it reached in early September. The RS line compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500, and when it slopes upward it means it is outperforming the broader index. A strong RS line is a key ingredient in winning stocks.


Mastercard stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 94, which puts it in the top 6% of stocks tracked. The [Stock Checkup Tool shows it has an attractive mixture](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mastercard-inc-cl-a-ma.aspx) of both strong fundamentals and excellent technical performance.


One strike against it is that earnings have grown by an average 22% over the past three quarters, below [CAN SLIM requirements for 25% growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). In addition, EPS growth has decelerated for the past two quarters, though earnings have grown by an average 30% over the past three years.



Analyst Rates Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri is rating Mastercard stock as outperform with a 287 target. He was impressed with the three-pronged growth strategy the firm detailed at its investor day in September.


"From our perspective, the most intriguing aspect of the presentation was its focus on monetization initiatives, with services and noncore processing mix continuing to increase, which, in our view, provide incremental growth/margin tailwinds," he said in a Sept. 13 research note.


Mastercard stock is seen by analysts as benefiting from ongoing expansion and digital initiatives. Several trends are benefiting payment stocks. Chief among these is the increasing use of electronic payments over cash and checks. While this process has been underway for some time on the consumer front, [business-to-business is set for rapid growth](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/). Mobile payments are also seen as an ongoing driver of growth.


Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider has said Mastercard stock will benefit from increasing share in the "underpenetrated" European market. This should boost Mastercard earnings. He also believes it is perfectly poised to lead in the B2B market, which is seen as [offering a $1 trillion opportunity for payment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/?preview_id=3729964).

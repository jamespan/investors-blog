**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and provides a lesson on how a double-digit gain can vanish quickly.




Autohome on Monday flashed a sell signal as the stock went on [an unwanted round trip](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/). That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout. It's also a reason to pay close attention to your portfolio during a [rough day on the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-selloff-trade-war-alibaba-stock/).


Chinese stocks like Autohome, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and others were getting hammered Monday amid continuing trade-war threats between the U.S. and China. President Trump increased his threats over the weekend, planning to stop Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology companies.


Autohome is a leading online market for automobile consumers. Its cloud platform for used-car sellers now covers more than 35,000 dealers.

Autohome stock is benefiting from burgeoning sales of automobiles online and the growth of China's urban middle class for whom the car is a status symbol.


Ascending-Base Platform
-----------------------


The stock hit a buy point of 107.64 on May 30, a day before the company was added to the closely watched MSCI indexes of China stocks. Company shares jumped 6.3% that day to close at 109.07. The stock broke above the 107.64 buy point from an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/), considered a rare but bullish chart pattern that can lead to powerful gains.


The IBD Stock Of The Day column can help you understand, for example, the right time to buy a stock, and the optimal time to sell. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.


It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low — thus, [the ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-rare-ascending-base-pattern/). However, both Autohome and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) provide the lesson that in a weakening market, an investor should [always prepare an exit plan](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) even after a leading stock produces this key chart pattern.


And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-rare-ascending-base-pattern/) in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.


Autohome's Market
-----------------


Autohome stock came public in December 2013, soaring more than 75% on its first day of trading. The [Autohome initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autohome-ipo-market-debut/) IPO raised $133 million, pricing shares at 17. The online automotive advertising market in China has achieved rapid growth as a result of the development of China's automotive and Internet industries. China is the largest market for car sales globally, but only an estimated 54 out of 1,000 Chinese own cars.


Autohome makes money mainly from advertising. It also has growing sales in auto finance and data products.


But where there is market opportunity, there is also competition. Autohome competitors include **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), a provider of online data and services for China's automotive industry.


More competition is emerging from China-based Uxin. The company offers one of the largest used-car e-commerce platforms in China, in terms of both the number of transactions facilitated and total GMV in 2017. Uxin is scheduled to commence an initial public offering, pricing shares Tuesday and trading Wednesday. It aims to raise $437 million by offering 38 million American depositary shares at a price range of 10.50 to 12.50. That gives it a fully diluted market value near $3.5 billion. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker UXIN.


Autohome Stock Flashes Sell Signal
----------------------------------


Autohome was on the exclusive list of [IBD Leaderboard stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). It was taken off the list Monday, along with Alibaba.


Autohome stock flashed a sell signal Monday, erasing a double-digit gain from the 107.64 buy point. Autohome stock plunged 5.6%. closing at 108.03 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Alibaba, meanwhile, gave up the 200 level with conviction early Monday. Alibaba shares were down 5.7% to 190.54.


Autohome reported [first-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autohome-earnings-top-estimates-revenue-guidance/) on May 8 that topped analyst estimates as it guided second-quarter estimates higher. Revenue rose 5% from the year-ago period to $205.35 million.


It earned an adjusted 70 cents a share, topping estimates for 60 cents and up 53%. The company sees second-quarter revenue of $283.8 million to $287 million. That's up roughly 26% vs. a year earlier.


In January it was profiled as an IBD [New America company](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/chinas-king-of-automotive-websites-still-has-room-to-grow/). It has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99.

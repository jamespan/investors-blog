MSCI stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the financial services company eyes a buy point after finding bullish support at a key level.




**MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) provides indexes used to create and benchmark exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. It's also a leader in an area of growth among institutional investors — environmental, social and governance (ESG) products and services.


Most (60%) of MSCI's revenue comes from its index business and 30% from an analytics business.


In addition, MSCI stock belongs to the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list, with accelerating earnings and revenue growth.


MSCI Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares added 0.6% to close at 479.51 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), after a strong rebound off the 50-day line Thursday. The 50-day bounce offers an early entry around 464.


MSCI stock is also closing in on an official 495.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) in a flat base going back to late April, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It's a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/), a bullish chart pattern.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for MSCI stock remains well below the consolidation peak. It rose sharply for most of 2018 and 2019 but has been lackluster lately. A rising RS line means that a stock is currently outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown.


Among peers, **S&P Global** ([SPGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPGI)) rose 1.5%, **CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)) added 0.75%, and **FactSet Research Systems** ([FDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDS)) gained 1.2%.


The specialty financial services industry group is acting well, ranked No. 24 out of 197 groups, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).


MSCI stock's [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is a solid 84 out of 99. It holds a mediocre [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 70 out of a possible 99. That means it has outperformed 70% of all stocks in the past year.


However, MSCI shows eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Well-regarded funds such as Fidelity Contrafund own MSCI stock.

In 2021, Wall Street sees MSCI earnings rising 23% to $9.60 per share, according to FactSet. Revenue is seen growing 22% to $1.974 billion. MSCI sports a superior [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 94 out of 99.

In Q1, MSCI'S recurring subscription revenue increased 10.9% while asset-based fees jumped 26.5%. The New York based company called those numbers "fundamental indicators of the long-term health of the MSCI franchise," and also raised its outlook for free cash flow.


ESG investing is area of growth. MSCI expects the market for ESG products and services to further expand to $3.9 billion from a current $3.2 billion "over the near term."


Four analysts on Wall Street rate MSCI stock a buy, three have a hold and one has a sell, FactSet says.

**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the specialty payments firm closes in on a buy zone. FleetCor earnings are on tap Nov. 6, with analysts expecting another quarter of accelerating growth.




Closing in on its fourth straight weekly gain, FleetCor stock has regained key support this week. Payment stocks in general have rallied after Dow Jones giant **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and digital payments pioneer **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) topped earnings estimates.


FleetCor stock, Visa stock and PayPal stock are all in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which reports earnings next week, is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). FleetCor stock is on Leaderboard's watch list.


While it is best known for providing prepaid fuel cards for fleets, FleetCor has not been resting on its laurels. It has been making a big push into other commercial payments services.


The firm has beefing up its business through acquisitions and partnerships. In March, FleetCor agreed to buy Novicepay, which will help it fight for share in the rapidly growing [business-to-business payments space](https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/). And last month it announced a partnership in Brazil between **Nissan** ([NSANY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSANY)) and Sem Parar, a FleetCor company in the electronic toll, parking and fuel payment solutions space.

FleetCor Stock Analysis
-----------------------


Shares rose 0.9% to 298.82 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). FleetCor stock is closing in on a buy zone after forming a [seven-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 304.75, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Shares regained the 50-day line and ran into an area of resistance in the flat base.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for FleetCor stock is modestly off late August peaks, but that follows a strong ascent from mid-December. FleetCor stock rallied 77% from its Dec. 24 low to its Sept. 6 peak. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



FleetCor Technologies has an impressive [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 95, which puts it in the top 5% of stocks. This is enough to net it second place in the competitive Financial Services-Specialty Industry Group. This group ranks a decent 62 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.


FleetCor Earnings Growth Accelerates
------------------------------------


IBD's [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-fleetcor-technologies-flt.aspx) shows positive signs for potential investors. The stock boasts an EPS Rating of 90 and a Relative Strength Rating of 93. FleetCor earnings growth over the last three quarters averaged just 11%, [well below CAN SLIM's 25% benchmark](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). But, after three quarters of slowing growth, FleetCor earnings growth accelerated modestly to 11% in the last quarter, with analysts expecting faster growth in the next report.


That FleetCor earnings report is due after the stock market closes on Nov. 6. Wall Street sees third-quarter EPS rising 14% to $3.05 with sales up nearly 10% to $680 million.


FleetCor earnings are seen swelling by 12% in 2019, and by 15% in 2020. Analysts have recently adjusted the latter figure upward.


If FleetCor stock breaks out next week, investors won't have much time to build a cushion before earnings. Investor's Business Daily advocates an [earnings options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/). It's a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the downside risk.

**Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the off-price retailer bets the treasure-hunt urge will top e-commerce trends. BURL stock flirted with a buy point.




BURL Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares rose 1.6% to close at 334.80 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). BURL stock briefly topped a 336.53 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) off a cup-with-handle base, then retreated, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Much of the pattern formed below the 50-day line but the handle formed above it, which is a positive.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is below the consolidation peak, though not far from highs. A rising RS line, the blue line in the chart shown, means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index.


BURL stock holds a solid [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 84 out of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx) tool. That means it outperformed 84% of all stocks in the past year.


Its [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is 77 out of 99.


Burlington Stores belongs to the apparel and shoes retail industry group, which ranks a solid No. 8 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. The group, which has been showing strong share-price momentum as a whole, includes off-price peers **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), as well as the likes of **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)).


Off-price and discount retailers tend to be resilient in tough markets. That could make Burlington stock a nice counterweight to tech-heavy names in a growth stock portfolio.


Burlington shows a poor [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Accumulation%2fDistribution+(Acc%2fDis)+Rating&termid=1) of D, on an A+ to E scale. However, BURL stock shows three quarters of increasing fund ownership, with 1,248 funds owning it as of June, up 2% from March.

Burlington's Big Gamble
-----------------------


The New Jersey-based retailer earns a poor [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 45 out of 99. Burlington turned to a loss last fiscal year amid the pandemic, with sales sliding 21%.


For all of fiscal 2021, Wall Street expects Burlington Stores to swing to EPS of $8.81 after losing $2.57 a share last year. Sales are seen increasing 55% to $8.916 billion for the full year.


On May 27, the retailer delivered a huge earnings beat for the first quarter, though BURL stock fell that day. Sales jumped 174% year over year, accelerating sharply from a 3% gain the prior quarter. Armed with stimulus checks, shoppers flocked to "treasure hunt" for clothes, shoes and accessories again as states across the nation started to reopen.


Even against pre-pandemic 2019 results, Q1 earnings increased 106% while sales rose 35%. In addition, comparable store sales increased 20% and margins expanded 230 basis points.


Management touted operating with leaner inventories and adopting a smaller-store format. Meanwhile, the company is betting on brick-and-mortar stores over e-commerce.


In March, Burlington Stores said it's targeting 2,000 stores in the long term, up from a prior target for 1,000 stores. It tied the hike to its pursuit of a smaller-store format, as well as opportunities from retail disruption and industry store closures. In 2021, Burlington expects to open 75 net new stores.


It also said it's exiting e-commerce entirely.


"In our business, which is a moderate off-price business, the nature of the treasure hunt and the average price point that we operate at mean that bricks-and-mortar stores have a significant competitive and economic advantage over e-commerce," CEO Michael O'Sullivan said on a March 5, 2020, earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.

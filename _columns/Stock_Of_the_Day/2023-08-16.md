Construction and mining equipment maker **Terex** ([TEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEX)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). TEX stock has rallied nearly 43% so far this year and is trading in a buy zone.




The construction industry has run a middling advance this year. The [Machinery-Construction/Mining](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool?symbol=CAT&source=sitemarketcondition) group is up about 24% so far in 2023. That lags the Nasdaq's 29% gain, but easily tops the S&P 500's 15% gain. Meanwhile, construction projects are heating up this summer.


Monthly construction spending rose to $19.38 billion in June, up 0.5% from the revised May estimate and increasing 3.5% from 2022 levels, the Census Bureau announced Aug. 1. Construction spending hit $917.4 billion for the first six months of the year, up from $890.4 billion for the same period last year.


U.K.-based **CNH Industrial** ([CNHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNHI)) has trended lower throughout the year, whereas Dow Jones rival **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) logged a 15% gain since Dec. 31. Milwaukee-based competitor **Manitowoc** ([MTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTW)) has an 82.5% advance so far for the year.


Norwalk, Conn.-based Terex offers a variety of heavy-duty construction equipment including light towers, cranes, lifts, conveyors and crushers. The company's brands include Genie, EvoQuip and Fuchs, among others.


Terex received a host of price target upgrades in early August after blowing away Q2 forecasts on Aug. 1 and raising its outlook for the second time this year.


Earnings spiked 120% to $2.35 per share on 30% sales growth, to $1.4 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $1.66 per share on $1.27 billion in revenue.


Terex lifted its earnings outlook to around $7 per share, compared to the prior guidance of $5.60 to $6 per share. The company sees net sales around $5.1 billion for the year vs. its earlier forecast of $4.8 billion to $5 billion.


KeyBanc raised its price target to 80 from 72 following results, noting that Terex's near-record backlog suggestmultiyearar growth. Wells Fargo lifted its price target to 74 from 66 and maintained an overweight rating on shares.


TEX Stock
---------



TEX stock pared gains Wednesday after an initial 3.5% jump. The stock rebounded from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) earlier in the week. Shares were already trading in the buy zone for a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) after climbing above the 58.85 buy point on June 19. The [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/), which extends 5% beyond a buy point, runs to 61.79.

**Excelerate Energy** ([EE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EE)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the U.S. liquefied natural gas play is setting up again after two failed breakout attempts. EE shares edged lower Wednesday, below a buy point amid as the market pulled back.




Excelerate Energy, founded in 2003, went public in April this year. Excelerate Energy stock's IPO price was $24. The Woodlands, Texas-based company is a leading operator of Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRUs).


FSRUs offer added flexibility compared to traditional land-based gas terminals. In addition to transporting LNG, these vessels have the onboard capability to vaporize the LNG and deliver natural gas through both offshore and near-shore receiving facilities.


Excelerate Energy also offers FSRU infrastructure development services and it has 12 offices across the globe.


U.S. natural gas prices dropped 1.3% to $6.31 per million British thermal units Wednesday, as futures fell after edging up earlier in the week. Prices are up more than 50% since the start of the year, but are around 40% off a 14-year high hit in August.


Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, it has mostly shut down its supply of natural gas to the European Union as a consequence of the war. That supercharged Europe's demand for LNG for much of the year, making it a key competitor with Asia for supply. EU demand for the fuel has ebbed as storage facilities have filled to capacity.


Germany recently signed a five-year contract with Excelerate Energy to charter the company's FSRU to supply LNG. The agreement will begin in the first quarter of 2023.

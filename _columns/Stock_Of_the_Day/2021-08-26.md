Shale producer **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as DVN stock is offering an early buying opportunity after breaking through its 50-day line.




Oil prices have been on a roller-coaster ride since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. After gaining ground during the start of the busy summer travel season, U.S. oil prices tumbled below the key $70 benchmark following a contentious OPEC+ meeting in July. The cartel along with Russia agreed to gradually end the remainder of production curbs that began last year.


But the White House called on OPEC+ on Aug. 11 to boost production further to prevent oil prices from stalling the economic recovery.


Meanwhile, the emergence of the delta variant and rising Covid-19 cases in the U.S. has damped fuel demand. Airlines are seeing the lowest level of passengers since the spring.

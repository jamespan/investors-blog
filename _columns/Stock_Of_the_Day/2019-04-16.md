**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) has recaptured a bit of its old magic as it continues to race from a February breakout, making it IBD Stock of the Day. After booking solid gains, the time may be ripe to take profits in Cisco stock.




For a mature company like Cisco, the 20% gain from its latest breakout is unusually strong. Even companies at their strongest periods of growth tend to start new stock bases after climbing 20% to 25% from a breakout. So, historical tendencies suggest a top is near, even if the stock now looks unstoppable.


A look at Cisco Systems' long-term chart finds few advances of similar magnitude in the past decade, making this a rare moment of triumph for the stock. Shares surged 35% from a breakout in October 2017 to a peak in March of last year.


After spending about a year in a horizontal trend, shares of the network equipment maker broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in mid-February with a 47.69 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's been an easy stock to hold since then, with support at the 10-day moving average during almost the entire run.

The relative strength line is trending higher, and shares hit a new high Tuesday. Certainly, the stock market's remarkable advance since Christmas has a lot to do with Cisco's stock gains. Technology shares have shouldered much of this rally.


This year's run for Cisco is a reminder, in small measure, of the monumental gain the stock had from its IPO in 1990 to the March 2000 stock market peak. In the 1990s, the company became a major supplier of the hardware to build internet networks. Shares rocketed more than 10,200% in that period.


Stock Of The Day No Longer A Fast Grower
----------------------------------------


Today, Cisco is growing at a moderate pace. Its five-year average annual earnings growth rate is 6% and the sales growth rate is a meager 1%. The company these days has found success as a seller of equipment for data centers, and the Catalyst 9000 computer network switches are fueling sale growth. In fact, the company's Feb. 13 earnings report got the most recent breakout going.


Still, this is not time for complacency. Investors need to be ready if Cisco's spry spirit starts to grow tired.


When exactly to take profits? Selling at a new high locks in a profit of more than 20% for those who bought at the 47.69 buy point around Valentine's Day. Another option is to wait until the stock closes below its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/), which is now around 55.80. Yet another possibility is to wait for shares to climb 25% from the last entry, or reach 59.61.


Shares ended trading Tuesday up 0.7% to 56.95. During the session, Cisco stock touched a high of 57.53, a mark not seen since late 2000.


On Tuesday, [Goldman Sachs removed Cisco from its favored Americas Conviction List](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-stock-goldman-conviction-list-arista/), although an analyst raised the price target to 62 from 58. Analysts expect earnings for the April-ending quarter to rise 17%, in line with the past several quarters.


But while the fundamentals aren't bad, remember that leading stocks often top out well before sales, earnings, margins and other financials start to show deterioration.

$40 Billion Stock Buyback
-------------------------


That September jump-up came after Microsoft announced an 11% increase to its quarterly dividend to 51 cents a share, up 5 cents from the previous dividend. The company's board also authorized a [new share repurchase program](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-notches-new-high-on-dividend-hike-share-buybacks/), totaling up to $40 billion in stock buybacks.


Earlier that week, Microsoft announced it would report new performance metrics during its next earnings report. This includes Xbox content and services revenue growth.


"We view this as a signal that gaming is becoming a more important segment at Microsoft and is a long-term driver of top-line growth and investment," Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan wrote in a recent note to clients. He has an outperform rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 160.


Horan views Microsoft as a "top pick," due to its strength in cloud computing, along with its heavy investments in artificial intelligence and in the Internet of Things, "which we view as important drivers of cloud demand over the next decade."


Stake In Several Megatrends
---------------------------


The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant has a stake in several megatrends, such as cloud computing and software-as-a-service. Its cloud offerings include Azure infrastructure services, Office 365 productivity software and Dynamics business software.


Microsoft competes with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), among others, in cloud-computing services.


To compete with cloud market leader Amazon, Microsoft has been forging strategic alliances with a host of companies. They include **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).


For the current September quarter, [Microsoft expects sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-earnings-q4-2019-microsoft-stock/) of $32.1 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance, edging views of $32 billion. Analysts now expect Microsoft earnings of $1.24 a share, up 9%, on sales of $32.2 billion, Zacks said.

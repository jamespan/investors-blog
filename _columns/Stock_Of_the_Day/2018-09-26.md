**Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of fiber-optic communications products forms a three-weeks-tight chart pattern following a beat-and-raise report for the fiscal third quarter that sent shares surging.




Hanover, Md.-based Ciena makes system-level optical products for communications networks and data centers. It's not to be confused with makers of optical components, which have been laggards in IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group.


Ciena stock popped 15% in the first two trading days after it reported its results on Aug. 30. Ciena stock has met resistance at a price range of 25 to 27 going back to 2015, and arguably back to 2013.


The earnings beat, however, changed investors' outlook, William Blair analyst Dmitry Netis said in a note to clients.

"Ciena delivered the goods in a make-or-break quarter with shares toying with a critical level, where they have been several times before over the last several years, but have never broken out of it— until now," Netis said.


"The company's performance was solidly ahead of expectations, with record backlog, better-than-expected margins, and an outlook that indicates improved visibility in the business," he added, "which management chalked up to robust demand and share gains given the company's diversification efforts and technology leadership."


Three-Weeks-Tight Pattern
-------------------------


Ciena said third-quarter earnings rose 37% to 48 cents a share. Revenue rose 12% to $819 million. Analysts had projected earnings of 36 cents and revenue of $792 million.


Ciena forecast fiscal fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $845 million to $875 million, topping analyst estimates of $852 million.


Following the third-quarter beat, Ciena stock formed a bullish [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). Having blown past a buy point, the stock consolidated in narrow trading action. Ciena stock closed near 31 on Sept. 7, Sept. 14 and Sept. 21.


Ciena's main customers have been telecom firms such as **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)). AT&T and Verizon accounted for 23% of sales during the third quarter.


The fiber-optic gear maker, though, has targeted the data-center market. Ciena's WaveServer optical box targets the data-center-interconnect market. Internet firms are upgrading cloud data centers to speed up communications.


Data-Center Focus Sparks Sales
------------------------------


Ciena is also getting a boost from overseas sales.


"Diversification is evident with (data center) web scale at 20% of sales, India over 10%, and traction in Japan," Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said in his note to clients.


**Infinera** ([INFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFN)), a rival of Ciena, agreed to buy Coriant in a deal valued at $430 million. Those two companies will face challenges integrating product lines, analysts say.


Said Tim Long at BMO Capital Markets: "As Ciena continues to diversify, we expect to see further share gains and customer wins, particularly amid industry consolidation."


And Piper Jaffray's Troy Jensen said: "We believe competitive dynamics are improving with Coriant being acquired by Infinera and view Ciena as the potential share gainer during this industry consolidation."


Ciena Makes Acquisition
-----------------------


Ciena struggled with its acquisition of Cyan in 2015, but analysts are upbeat about Ciena's latest acquisition. On Sept 5, Ciena bought privately held DonRiver, a software and services company. Terms were not disclosed.


Moody's Investor Service on Sept. 11 raised Ciena's credit rating a notch.


"We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next year, stable gross margins in the low-to-mid-40% range, and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 14%," Moody's said.


Shares in Ciena fell 1.4% to close at 30.89 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).


IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group is ranked No. 139 out of 197 industry groups.

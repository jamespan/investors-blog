Technology services provider **Endava** ([DAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAVA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as its relative strength line hits a new high in an unsettled market. Endava stock is nearing an entry point after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped expectations.

Endava stock trades about 2% below an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 143.60. DAVA stock has been [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) for seven weeks, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


Banking Customers A Bright Spot
-------------------------------


Endava stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99. The 95 RS Rating means that Endava stock is outperforming 95% of all stocks in terms of price strength. The market's biggest winners typically have an 80 or better RS Rating.


Meanwhile, the IT services firm's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/) has hit a new high. Stocks showing strength during market corrections often become leaders in the next uptrend.


In the June quarter, Endava's revenue rose 65% to $184.6 million including acquisitions. Earnings per share jumped 104% to 57 cents.


Endava forecast fiscal 2022 revenue growth in a range of 38% to 40%.


"Helped by acceleration from North America and good growth across the payments/banking vertical, DAVA put up another strong quarter," Susquehanna analyst James Friedman said in a report.


He added, "Supported by a sharp increase in new accounts and average spend, visibility has improved across geographies and verticals."


DAVA Stock: Hiring Ramps Up
---------------------------


A small-cap stock, Endava holds a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-endava-plc-cl-a-ads-dava.aspx).Â IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical performance. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


However, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane has a hold rating on Endava stock.


"DAVA stock continues to expand its scope of work with existing clients while adding new logos as total client numbers grew to 615 (from 416 a year ago)," Keane said in a report. "A large number of new, smaller projects came online that DAVA expects will expand into larger engagements."


Endava Acquisition Spree
------------------------


He added, "Due to the acceleration in demand, net hiring ramped up in the June quarter with total headcount rising 34% year over year, reaching 8,883."


Meanwhile, Endava has been acquisitive. In 2019, it bought Exozet, a German IT services firm. Last year, Endava acquired Dublin-based Comtrade Digital Services, a software engineering services and solutions provider.


In North America, Endava bought Levvel in April. A month earlier, it bought Croatia-based Five along with its U.S. subsidiary.


"Its acquisition-focused capital allocation strategy will allow the company to continue diversifying revenue exposure and digital capabilities," said Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette in a report.

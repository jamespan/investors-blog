**Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it chases a buy point on the back of big earnings growth.




But in the event of a breakout, history suggests that Hilton stock may not go on a massive run. So investors should keep in mind the 20% rule onÂ [when to take at least partial profits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/).


The hotel giant operates more than 5,600 properties in 113 countries and territories. Hilton stock has been outperforming for the past six months. Meanwhile, growth is expected to continue even after the firm posted better-than-expected earnings in eight of the past nine quarters.


Hilton's development pipeline currently consists of more than 2,400 hotels, and it plans to move into 35 countries and territories where it currently does not have any running hotels.

Hilton Stock Analysis
---------------------


Hilton has been consolidating for the past 59 weeks, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). It is now forming a handle with an 85.97 buy point. Shares closed up 0.3% at 83.67 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Rival **Hyatt** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) rose 0.6%, **Marriott** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) fell 0.4% and **Wyndham** ([WH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WH)) lost 0.25%. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) ETF rallied 0.35%.


A bullish indicator for Hilton stock is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/). It is on an upward trend, and is approaching a new high.


Hilton stock managed to hold steady during the market sell-off in December. It held above its prior low set in October, which also occurred during a broad sell-off. This is a show of strength.


The stock is also well clear of two important technical benchmarks, the 50- and 200-day lines. Its recent good performance could see its 50-day moving average move above the 200-day for the first time since last August, another bullish indicator.


Earnings growth has been impressive, running up at an average 42% over the past four quarters. It also accelerated in the most recent quarter. Sales growth has been less impressive, averaging 10% growth over the same period, but also accelerated last quarter.



Hilton stock looks to be a good candidate for investors to capture a 20%-25% gain before cashing out of their position. This is because it has middling sales growth that does not suggest bigger gains, and Hilton stock has tended to move sideways for long periods.


In addition, when one looks at its weekly charts, previous run-ups have tended to follow a stair-step pattern, with the stock taking a breather after big gains before ascending higher.


Hilton Stock Has Solid Fundamentals
-----------------------------------


The stock currently holds a good [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 89. It also currently tops the [Leisure-Lodging Industry Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-12-2019/). The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-hilton-worldwide-hldgs-hlt.aspx) shows while it currently holds a lukewarm EPS Rating of 78, earnings per share is expected to swell by 38% in the current year. Its technical performance is more impressive, which is why it holds a Relative Strength Rating of 91.


Canny [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) connoisseurs are always on the lookout for stocks with institutional sponsorship. Here Hilton stock scores highly, with 225 funds opening new positions during the last quarter. The numbers that added and cut their positions basically offset each other.


Vanguard and T. Rowe Price are two of the biggest institutional shareholders.

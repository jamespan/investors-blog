Autodesk Stock: Fiscal 2023 Financial Targets
---------------------------------------------


Autodesk stock has gained nearly 34% in 2020 amid the coronavirus outbreak. Shares rebounded from March lows along with many other technology stocks.


At the June 4 analyst day, Autodesk management "reiterated the company's fiscal 2023 financial targets assuming some signs of a recovery by Q4 of this year," said a Goldman Sachs report.


"Management expects revenue to grow at a 16% to 18% compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (reaching $5.1 billion to $5.4 billion)," said Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini in a report.


Also, the software maker is targeting fiscal 2023 free cash flow of $2.4 billion, she added.


"Additionally, management noted expectations for double digit revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth beyond fiscal 2023 based on the company's current portfolio of products," Bellini said.


At Morgan Stanley, analyst Keith Weiss said in a report: "Management clearly laid out long-term growth drivers, including greater cloud-based collaboration among customers."


Autodesk Acquisition Targets Construction Industry
--------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Autodesk ranks No. 46 on the [IBD 50 roster of fast growing companies](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


In addition, Autodesk stock has an IBD [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87. That means it has outperformed 87% of stocks over the past 12 months.Â The best growth stocks typically have RS Ratings of at least 80.


In addition, Autodesk on May 27 reported April quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents a share on $886 million in sales. That topped estimates for an 81-cent profit on sales of $879 million.


Further, Autodesk told analysts that it has gained traction in converting roughly 14 million nonpaying users into paying subscribers.


Autodesk Stock: Using AI To Help Builders
-----------------------------------------


Also, the company in July agreed to acquire Pype. Its artificial intelligence-based software automates construction project management workflows. In addition, many software companies aim to improve products with AI tools.


"The acquisition of Pype, an [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) driven private company, further enhances Autodesk capabilities in the construction segment that we believe will be one of the biggest growth drivers for ADSK into the future," JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in a report to clients.


In addition, Autodesk stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

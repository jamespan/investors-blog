**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after flashing two key sell signals Thursday, which presents an opportunity to lock down gains. Chipotle stock sold off Thursday on an analyst downgrade over African swine fever fears.




BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik cut his Chipotle stock rating to underperform from market perform and slashed his price target to $620 from $675. He believes Chipotle Mexican Grill could be badly hit by a spike in pork and other meat prices due to the disease decimating pig herds.


"It has the greatest pork exposure in our coverage (estimated at 10%), and our work suggests that CMG realizes commodity inflation with little to no lag," Strelzik said in a research note. "This suggests that CMG could be among the earliest to realize the impacts of African Swine Fever, potentially as early as Q3 2019."


Strelzik also highlighted **Bloomin' Brands** ([BLMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLMN)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) as two other stocks that could be adversely affected.


Baird analysts said selling in Chipotle and Texas Roadhouse stock was overdone, seeing higher meat prices as a temporary factor.

African swine fever is a highly contagious virus that has spread to every province on the Chinese mainland since last August. Millions of animals have died. This has forced China, the world's biggest pork producer, to turn to imports to make up for shortfalls.

That's boosting pork prices worldwide, pushing up other meat prices as well. Meat prices in the EU have spiked 21.9% since last year. There has been a sharp rise since early March, with exports from the EU bloc to China rocketing by 25.9%.


Chipotle Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


One of the big winners of the 2019 market rally, Chipotle stock was the [IBD Stock Of The Day on May 6](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chipotle-stock-buy-points-new-high/), as shares rebounded from their 50-day line and neared record highs. But that was then.


Shares fell 5.5% to 667.12 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) in heavy volume.

That's an absolute sell signal for recent investors.



Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a record high on Monday, continuing a general uptrend going back more than a year as Chipotle stock continues to recover from several food safety incidents.


Chipotle stock has a top notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 95. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is a mediocre 62, but Chipotle earnings growth has rebounded in recent years.


But the stock market is in a correction with the Nasdaq undercutting its May 13 low on Thursday. Add that to the clear sell signals for Chipotle stock, and investors who bought shares recently should be out.

Chipotle Stock Recovering From Food Safety Scares
-------------------------------------------------

The Newport Beach, Calif.-based chain also has been working to improve stores. The initiatives translated to much-stronger-than-expected Q4 2018 earnings, while last month it also posted strong first-quarter earnings.


Chipotle has been making efforts to freshen up menu offerings, and to increase customer flow through initiatives such as mobile order and pay, and DoorDash delivery.

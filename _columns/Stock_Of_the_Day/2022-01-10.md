**Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The St. Louis, Mo.-based coal miner is a key supplier to a rapidly recovering steel industry. Arch stock is forming a cup-with-handle base, tracking a number of steel stocks showing strength in recent weeks. ARCH shares edged up Monday.


Coal stocks have received a boost in recent months from several different directions. Coal prices have been lifted by tight supplies of natural gas in Europe. And supply chain issues in China and India have helped send global coal prices higher.


While much of that pressure relates to thermal coal, used for electrical power generation, Arch Resources mines higher-energy metallurgical coal, or met coal. Also called coking coal, it is a key component for steelmakers. Met coal, which commands a higher price and margins than thermal coal, has been an attractive target for struggling coal miners.


Steelmakers like **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)), **Cleveland Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) and **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) have recently broken out of bases or are currently forming bases, underscoring the current strength in the rebounding industry.

ARCH Stock
----------


Shares gained 0.6% to $92.17 on the stock market today. ARCH stock is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), on a daily chart, according to [IBD MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). The handle shows a 96.63 entry point, and is riding short-term support at the stock's [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). However, more advanced investors could find an earlier entry point by tracing a downward trend line.


The company has a strong Relative Strength Rating of 97. The RS Rating gauges a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks against all the other stocks in IBD's database. Another measure, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), tracks performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line has been climbing steadily higher along with the stock's six-week advance.



Still, investors need to be cautious. The market's current status is deteriorating as the Nasdaq slips below its 200-day moving average and into correction territory. That means buying even leading stocks breaking out of valid bases can be riskier than usual.


Another caveat: institutional investors have been shying away from ARCH stock. The company has a D+ Accumulation/ Distribution Rating, which suggests more selling than buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


Arch is ranked No. 7 in IBD's Energy-Coal group. The stock has an 85 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of 99, and a poorer EPS Rating of 67. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.

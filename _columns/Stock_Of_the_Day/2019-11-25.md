China e-commerce giant **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as Alibaba stock on Monday broke out into a buy zone from a cup-with-handle formation.




Alibaba stock climbed 2%, closing at 190.45 on the [stock market today,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) as it cleared a 188.38 buy point from a choppy [cup-with-handle formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The buy range extends to 197.80.


Along with other [China stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/), Alibaba stock rose Monday as the major stock indexes rallied after China on Sunday announced plans to tighten intellectual property rules, a move that could improve the chance of a U.S.-China trade deal.


Alibaba stock also is trading less erratically in the past few weeks than in previous months.

Alibaba Stock Breakout Precedes Hong Kong IPO
---------------------------------------------


The breakout in Alibaba stock comes as the company on Tuesday will launch its [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-to-know-about-the-alibaba-ipo-hong-kong/) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The offering could raise about $11 billion, making it the largest IPO this year.


Alibaba, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, is offering 500 million shares at $22.50. It's a secondary listing as Alibaba will continue to trade on the NYSE.


The company expects to grant the international underwriters an option to purchase an additional 75 million new shares. Reports say the offering is "multiple times" oversubscribed with a high demand for shares.


Alibaba is the largest e-commerce company in China, where it competes with **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and others for a slice of the country's giant economy. In addition to its various e-commerce platforms for businesses and consumers, Alibaba also operates a cloud computing group as well as digital media and entertainment properties.


Alibaba Growth Opportunities
----------------------------


Similar to **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Alibaba has made a big push into groceries and is increasingly focused on brick-and-mortar retail operations. Another growth driver is international expansion. The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.


The company ended September with 785 million mobile monthly active users, up 30 million from the previous quarter. It had 693 million annual active consumers on its retail marketplace, an increase of 19 million.


Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said the company's long-term goal is to have 2 billion customers by 2036.


The company reported better-than-expected [fiscal second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-earnings-easily-beat-views-top-china-stock-rallies/) on Oct. 1, as its cloud computing revenue soared 64% to $1.3 billion. Total revenue jumped 40% from the year-ago period, in Chinese currency, to $16.65 billion. The company has registered double-digit revenue growth per quarter going back more than four years. It also has been profitable during that period.


Healthy Ratings For Alibaba Stock
---------------------------------


Alibaba has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92. The rating means Alibaba stock currently outperforms 92% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


It also has an [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 83. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


Further, the stock earns an 99 EPS Rating, meaning its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth is outpacing 99% of all stocks. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


Alibaba holds the No. 2 rank among its peers in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group. **Vipshop Holidings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) holds the No. 1 slot, with JD.com in third. JD.com reported better-than-expected [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-earnings-easily-beat-views-alibaba-rival-soars/) on Nov. 15.


However, the Retail-Internet industry group is currently out of favor with investors. It ranks No. 178 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

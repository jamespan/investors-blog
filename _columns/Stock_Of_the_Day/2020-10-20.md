**Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of premium video game hardware and peripherals benefits from the growth of esports and theÂ home entertainment boom spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Corsair stock hit a buy point on Tuesday.




In morning trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Corsair stock broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 22.60, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. It climbed to an all-time high of 23.40 before pulling back. Corsair stock jumped 14.5% to close at 22.97.


On Monday, at least seven Wall Street analysts [initiated coverage of Corsair stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/corsair-gaming-stock-called-play-esports-pc-gaming-growth/) with buy ratings. The Fremont, Calif.-based company held its initial public offering on Sept. 23 with shares priced at $17.


"Corsair has a solid niche in what otherwise appears to be a commodity business," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a note to clients. "Unlike many of its larger competitors, Corsair is firmly focused on the gaming segment, with the vast majority of its sales coming from a small, but dedicated base of hard-core gamers."

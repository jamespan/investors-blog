**Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares consolidate in the wake of the biotech company's strong first-quarter report.




The biotech company makes Ingrezza, a treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement disorder and a side effect of some antipsychotic medications. It's also a lifelong affliction.


In the first quarter, [Ingrezza brought in](https://neurocrine.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/neurocrine-biosciences-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial) $231.1 million in sales, up 69.4% year over year. Sales benefited from better-than-expected prescription trends and a positive — rather than negative — impact from channel inventory changes, SVB Leerink analyst Marc Goodman said in a note to clients.


"Importantly, management indicated that sales were mostly based on underlying demand and not Covid-19 stocking pull-through," Goodman said. Also, "April new prescriptions, while down sequentially, were also still better than expected."

Goodman kept his market perform rating and 105 price target on Neurocrine stock.


Ingrezza gained Food and Drug Administration approval three years ago, Neurocrine Chief Executive Kevin Gorman said in an emailed statement. Since then, the biotech company has worked to educate health care providers, patients and caregivers about the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.


"We remain extremely optimistic about the long-term opportunity to treat many more patients with tardive dyskinesia," he said.


Biotech Company Benefits From Telemedicine
------------------------------------------


Ingrezza revenue likely benefited from an early switch to telemedicine among specialists, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in his report to clients. Further, the biotech company's sales force works virtually amid growing education around tardive dyskinesia.


Also during the quarter, Neurocrine received $6 million in royalties from [**AbbVie**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abbvie-stock-buy-now/) ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) for Orilissa, a treatment for moderate to severe pain tied to endometriosis.


Neurocrine also gained FDA approval in April for Ongentys, a drug that helps Parkinson's disease patients with motor fluctuations. But the biotech company said it will delay launching Ongentys amid the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/). Partner Bial will manufacture Ongentys.


Needham analyst Alan Carr noted Neurocrine has adequate supply of Ongentys to launch now. But a supply chain issue at a Bial contract manufacturer "has created uncertainty for 2021." He expects the biotech company to offer an update on its strategy in early summer.



Across all products, revenue soared 71% to $237.1 million in the first quarter. Neurocrine also earned 82 cents per share, minus some items. Earnings charged ahead 183%.


Clinical Studies Planned
------------------------


Neurocrine is also studying Ingrezza as a treatment for chorea, another involuntary movement, associated with Huntington's disease.


Further, the biotech company plans to unveil the results of a Phase 2 study in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH, in June, Needham's Carr said. CAH belongs to a group of rare inherited diseases with key enzymes missing.


SVB Leerink's Goodman noted enrollment in clinical studies is now on pause due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But the biotech company still actively works with enrolled patients, he said. Neurocrine expects to unveil its pivotal study design later this year.


The CAH program is Neurocrine's most interesting asset, RBC's Abrahams said.


"Upcoming CAH updates should help highlight potential drivers for diversification though no data on steroid reduction will be yet included," he said in a report.


CEO Gorman also noted Neurocrine just exercised its option to license the global rights to Swiss drug company Idorsia's treatment for a rare form of pediatric epilepsy. The biotech company plans to begin a Phase 2 study of that drug in the second half of 2020.


Highly Ranked Neurocrine Stock
------------------------------


Neurocrine stock dipped 1% to close at 112.48 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Neurocrine shares rank among the most bullish for Investor's Business Daily.


The stock ranks sixth out of its industry group of nearly 600 biotech companies. Neurocrine stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. This puts shares in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth measures.


Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) now is at 90 out of 99 with its RS line pointing upward. That metric looks at how shares are performing against the rest of the market.


Its stock is also highly sought after by big institutional investors. As of late March, the Fidelity OTC portfolio and T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund were longtime investors in Neurocrine stock.

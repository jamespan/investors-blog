**Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The "dog'nostics" leader is benefiting from a rebound in pet adoptions, leading Idexx stock to spot multiple possible entries.




The animal-health company provides diagnostics equipment and tests for veterinarians. Credit Suisse analyst Katie Tryhane notes there are "inherent advantages" in the animal health sector over its human counterpart. For example, insurance reimbursement isn't the same obstacle when it comes to medicine for Buddy and Bandit.


Meanwhile, pet adoptions are also on the rise. Idexx and fellow animal-health stock **Covetrus** ([CVET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVET)) recently called out 6% growth in pet adoptions last year, Tryhane said in a report. Idexx also recently raised its total addressable market expectation to $37 billion, up from its $33 billion projection in 2019.


"We continue to view the animal-health sector as an attractive alternative health care investment, with continuing strength in demand along with inherent advantages over human health care including more efficient (research and development), sustainable portfolios and limited reimbursement concerns," Tryhane said. She has an outperform rating on Idexx stock.

Idexx Stock Eyes Multiple Opportunities
---------------------------------------


Investors in Idexx stock are noticing the pop — not only for animal-health companies, but also for the life sciences tools and diagnostics segment. Idexx is part of the Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group on [IBD Digital.](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital) That group ranks sixth out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. It's also part of IBD's [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list.


The entire group is enjoying a two-month run in which it has stayed above its key moving averages.


Idexx stock ranks sixth in that group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. The CR measures a stock's fundamental and technical growth measures. This puts Idexx stock in the top 2% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Also promising, Idexx stock has a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90. So, shares rank in the leading 10% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.


On [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s weekly chart, shares of Idexx are forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 707.05. But Idexx stock is also finding support at its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and [10-week](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) lines. A bounce off the 10-week line would make shares actionable. Idexx stock dipped 0.8% to close at 668.27 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Idexx representatives declined comment.



Pet Adoptions Spark Long-Term Growth
------------------------------------


Credit Suisse's Tryhane expects the strength to continue for Idexx. During its recent Investor Day, the company guided to 10% top-line growth over the next five years.


Idexx also expects its operating margin to expand, driven by highly profitable recurring revenue, price increases, efficiencies in its reference labs and direct sales efforts. The company further called for profit growth of 15%-20%. That's consistent with its previous long-term view.


Earlier this month, Idexx launched its newest hematology analyzer, dubbed ProCyte One. Better-than-expected placement of ProCyte One at veterinary clinics could also drive upside, Tryhane said. After the company's Investor Day, she raised her price target on Idexx stock to 760 from 735.

Vets' Diagnostic Use Is Growing
-------------------------------


Diagnostic use is growing at veterinary clinics, Tryhane said. During the pandemic, people spent more time with their pets — helping them notice new health issues. Working from home also makes it easier to take a pet to the vet. These trends have bolstered Idexx stock, she says.


She referenced a June 2021 report highlighting "that over 88% of pet owners consider their pet's health is as important to them as taking care of their own health (vs. 77% with July 2020 survey), underscoring some of the incrementally encouraging pandemic-driven tailwinds."

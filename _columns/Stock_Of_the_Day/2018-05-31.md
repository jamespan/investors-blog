**Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day,](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and is among a number of payment stocks in buy zones, including **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)).







Shares of Green Dot, a prepaid debit card and financial technology provider, are also setting up for existing shareholders to add to their positions.


The stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 69.47 buy point on May 10, a day after Green Dot reported first-quarter earnings. Shares fell 2.4% to 71.27 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), putting them back within the 5% chase zone.


Meanwhile, Green Dot has formed a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) pattern. If the stock reaches 74.33, the move could present an opportunity for existing shareholders to buy more.

**Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the media and entertainment giant looks to return to growth with the economy reopening. Disney stock is in buy range and could present a new entry soon.




In late April, the company's California theme parks are set to reopen. They were shut down for more than a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, Disney could be seen as a vaccine-leveraged stock, with businesses from parks to movies and cruises poised to benefit as more coronavirus restrictions ease.


Wall Street expects revenue will grow 6% in fiscal 2021, which ends in September, then jump 24% in 2022, far above the average 8% growth seen over the past three years. EPS is seen down 1.5% in fiscal 2021 then soaring 136% to $4.70 in 2022.


During the lockdown of its parks, Disney didn't sit still. It revealed plans last week to upgrade its California parks with new rides, shops and restaurants.


Meanwhile, Disney+ continues to add subscribers at a robust clip, helped by buzzworthy content and rising fees.


Shows such as "WandaVision" and "The Mandalorian" were massive streaming hits, while feature films like "Raya and the Last Dragon" and Pixar's "Soul" premiered on Disney+. Now, it's taking the highly anticipated Marvel title "Black Widow" to theaters and the Disney+ streaming platform simultaneously.


By 2024, [Disney forecasts 230 million-260 million Disney+ subscribers](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/14/disney-forecast-to-steal-netflix-crown-as-worlds-biggest-streaming-firm), up from an estimate of 60 million-90 million when the service launched in the U.S. just over a year ago. Disney could even take **Netflix**'s ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) crown as the world's biggest streaming firm in 2024, with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) also hot on Netflix's heels.

Disney Stock Technical Analysis
-------------------------------


Shares rose 0.4% to close at 185.53 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) as they tried to find support at the 10-week line. Disney stock is back above a 183.50 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) first cleared Feb. 8, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The flat base stretches back to January and follows a huge rally for Disney stock from March 2020 coronavirus lows.


If shares get back above their 21-day line, they would likely snap a downtrend and offer an early entry for a short consolidation that could be a flat base after next week with a 203.12 entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Disney stock is lackluster. It rose for most of 2020 but has moved sideways in the longer term. A rising RS line means that a stock is currently outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown.


Disney holds a solid [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 70 out of a best-possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That means it has outperformed 70% of all stocks in the past year. However, its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is a weak 29.


It earns a dismal [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 13 out of 99 and an [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=SMR+Rating&termid=1) of D, on a scale of A+ to a worst E.


Disney stock shows two quarters of increasing fund ownership, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-walt-disney-company-dis.aspx). That's a sign that bullish hopes for Disney's transformation are attracting the big money.

**Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), and unlike most companies featured in this daily column, its current action offers a unique twist for investors.




Keep in mind that IBD's [current outlook for growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) remains at "Market in correction." This means that any long position in stocks carries extra risk. [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) will signal immediate changes to this outlook and alert readers on the best time to wade back into the market.


Some high-profile investors have called derivatives "weapons of financial destruction." But in the case of Zscaler, a call option offers a way to participate in potential strong upside — and set an unbreakable lid on how much one can lose in a single trade.


Specifically, a call option with a 73 strike price expiring June 14 gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Zscaler at 73. In midday trading Thursday, that call showed a midpoint of $5.45 between the $5.30 best bid price and $5.60 best ask.


So, one call option would cost $545 plus broker commissions. That's equal to 7.5% of the $7,300 it would take to buy 100 common shares outright at 73 each.


On Thursday, Zscaler stock traded as high as 74.55 heading into its fiscal third-quarter report due after the market close. Shares ended the day at 72.99, up 2.6%.


If Zscaler stock falls 10% on its earnings report, the loss on the equity position would be $730. But the most one could lose via the option would be the purchase amount, or in this case $545 plus fees.


If Zscaler posts a big gap up in price, the call option holder could either exercise the right to buy 100 shares at 73, or simply sell the option at a profit.


Why focus on a call option with the 73 strike?


As noted repeatedly in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and IBD's coverage, Zscaler recently broke out of a shallow cup base with a 73.04 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Since no handle formed, find the [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) by adding a dime to the base's left-side high.


The Current Challenge For Zscaler Stock
---------------------------------------


On April 1, the cybersecurity play hit a peak of 72.94, then corrected in price. A six-week cup base formed. The decline of 18% from the cup's high to low? Excellently mild. In most cases, a cup base showing a price correction of more than 33% tends to fail on the ensuing breakout.


On May 10, Zscaler stock broke out. Shares rallied 7% that day, and volume gushed more than twice its 50-day average. But with the market showing signs of unusually heavy institutional selling — known as [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) — Zscaler and many other market leaders have found it tough sledding.


Since that May 10 breakout, the midcap growth stock gained as much as 10% in the space of just six days. But by May 23, it forfeited all of that solid profit. In short: May has been a volatile period for growth stocks, making it harder to make money.


IBD's [current market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) is still in a red traffic signal.


When a stock rises 10% or more from a proper buy point, a key defensive sell rule is to make sure it does not make a [complete round trip of gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/).


Still A True Market Leader
--------------------------


So why focus on Zscaler stock at all now? Here are some reasons for the "glass is half full" argument to keep watching Zscaler closely.



One, those who had bought the stock at an earlier breakout on Jan. 31 have no reason to sell, other than to take profits. That day, the stock moved past a 48.34 buy point. It also acted well following the breakout past a 45.97 entry in a [handle on the cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The gain since those entries has exceeded 66% and 74%, respectively.


Plus, in its most recent breakout, Zscaler stock never triggered the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Two, Zscaler fundamentals and technicals remain superlative.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-zscaler-inc-zs.aspx) shows a top-notch 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and the same rank for [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). Plus, the stock has continued to rebound after a few tests of the 50-day moving average. That's a signature of excellent institutional demand.


Remember, the [I in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) stands for institutional sponsorship, and Zscaler is showing plenty of it. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares have soared from 156 funds in the first quarter of 2018 to 393 at the end of the first quarter this year.


Three, the San Jose, Calif., firm is showing signs that its new technology and model for protecting data and digital assets is gaining wider acceptance. Some companies can grow by taking market share from incumbents.


Zscaler Outperforms These Industry Peers
----------------------------------------



Some rivals aren't performing as well as Zscaler.


**Check Point Software** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)) has seen its sales growth slow dramatically. The top line in **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)) has shrunk in three of the past four quarters.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), a former big stock market winner, tumbled below its 200-day moving average Thursday. [The company late Wednesday reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-earnings-panw-stock-q12019/) fiscal third-quarter results with earnings up 26% a share and sales 28% higher, but the increases reflected decelerating growth.


Perhaps the only security software stock matching Zscaler in CAN SLIM terms right now? **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) of Israel.

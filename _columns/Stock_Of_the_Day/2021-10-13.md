**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker surges on the release of its latest graphics cards for gaming PCs. AMD stock popped above a key resistance level on Wednesday.




The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company on Wednesday launched its [AMD Radeon RX 6600 graphics cards](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2021-10-13-amd-radeon-rx-6600-graphics-card-delivers-incredible-high-refresh-rate). The PC product is designed to provide visually stunning, high-refresh rate 1080p gaming experiences to the midrange market. The new graphics cards start at $329.


Last week, AMD touted the benefits of its Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics for personal computers running **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) new [Windows 11](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2021-10-05-amd-and-microsoft-bring-powerful-reliable-computing-to-users-windows-11) operating system.


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMD stock rose 3.9% to 109.16.

AMD Stock Forming New Base
--------------------------


[AMD stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-buy-now/) hit a record high 122.49 on Aug. 4. On that day, it spiked into the [20%-to-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) following its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) a week earlier.


AMD stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 95.54 on July 28, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


During the stock market's recent correction, AMD stock fell below its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), a negative sign. On Wednesday, it surged above that line, which had been a resistance level.


AMD stock now appears to be forming a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 114.59 buy point. However, aggressive investors could consider its Oct. 7 high of 107.95 as an early entry. But with the [market still in correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-m-in-can-slim-why-market-direction-is-key-to-winning-in-stocks/), investors should be cautious.


Possible Catalysts For AMD
--------------------------


The next major catalyst for AMD stock could be the company's third-quarter earnings report, due in late October.


On Tuesday, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay said he expects a strong quarterly report and guidance from AMD. He sees continued strength in sales of PCs and servers driving its results.


AMD's pending acquisition of **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) also could be a catalyst for shares, Ramsay said in a note to clients. He rates AMD stock as outperform with a price target of 120.


AMD stock is tied for first place with five other stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx). Those six stocks share a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group.


The fabless semiconductor group ranks 10th out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.

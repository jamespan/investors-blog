**Evolent Health** ([EVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVH)), a developer of medical software, is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Evolent Health stock climbed into a [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) in early trade, as investors waited for the latest from the Federal Reserve.




The Arlington, Va.-based company provides software to help health care providers and payers control costs and financial risks. Evolent works with Medicaid, Medicare and private health plans. The company reports that its programs support more than 3 million patients in the U.S. across all lines of business.


Evolent Health holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the [Computer Software-Medical industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jul-05-2022/). **Privia Health** ([PRVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRVA)) and **Simulations Plus** ([SLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLP)) are also among the group's highest-rated stocks. PRVA was Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/prva-stock-how-this-ibd-stock-of-the-day-is-riding-a-wave-of-disruption/).


The company grew its revenue 38% in the first quarter to $297 million. EPS swung from a year-ago loss of 1 cent to a profit of 12 cents in the first quarter. EVH's full-year guidance for 2022 sees revenue of $1.16 billion to $1.21 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million.


Last week, Evolent agreed to acquire IPG, a provider of surgical management technology for musculoskeletal conditions, from asset manager **TPG** ([TPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPG)). Potential contingency payments could raise the $375 million deal to $462 million.


Evolent made its way onto the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list two weeks ago and was [profiled on June 22](https://www.investors.com/research/health-care-stock-evolent-health-nears-buy-point-market-attempts-rally/).

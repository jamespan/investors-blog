**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the software giant earns plaudits for its cloud computing advances and recent acquisitions. Microsoft stock is setting up a new entry point following its recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Microsoft stock lost 1.2% to close at 183.43. It was an overall down day for the stock market.

Microsoft Stock A Leader In Coronavirus Rebound
-----------------------------------------------


Microsoft stock has been a market leader in the recovery from the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/). It fell 31% from its all-time high of 190.70 on Feb. 11 to its low of 132.52 on March 23 before racing higher.


Microsoft stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-corp-msft.aspx). That means it has outperformed 91% of stocks over the past 12 months.


It is tied for first place out of seven stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group. Microsoft, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)) each have a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


The desktop software group ranks No. 11 out of [197 industry groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.



Build Conference Presentation Impresses
---------------------------------------


On Wednesday, Mizuho Securities analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated his buy rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 205.


In a note to clients, Moskowitz said he was impressed by the company's presentation this week at its online Build conference for developers.


Microsoft management noted much higher engagement levels across its Windows developer ecosystem. It also talked up its Teams collaboration platform and Azure cloud infrastructure.


Three Recent Acquisitions
-------------------------


Meanwhile, Microsoft has made several noteworthy acquisitions lately of privately held companies.


On Tuesday, it confirmed the purchase of U.K.-based Softomotive, a robotic process automation vendor.


On May 14, Microsoft's Azure unit announced the acquisition of Metaswitch. That followed the Azure unit's purchase of Affirmed Networks on April 23.


Microsoft stock is in the [IBD Long-Term Leaders Portfolio](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). It also is on the prestigious [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).

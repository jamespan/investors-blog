**Armstrong World Industries** ([AWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AWI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), and the flooring and ceiling maker's stock is flashing signs that it may soon be time to take some profits.




The Lancaster, Pa.-based company broke out of a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base with a 71.60 buy point in February, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Armstrong World stock has since soared 20%, pushing it into [profit-taking-zone sell range](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/).


Armstrong World shares dipped 0.45% to close at 85.96 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/) but remain 20% above the buy point.


After a run-up of 20%-25%, it's a good time to take at least [partial profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) because many stocks consolidate after gains of that magnitude.


Armstrong World's history also is an indicator that it's unlikely to climb much higher. In the last eight years, the stock has had two breakouts and climbed more than 20% above the entry point. But the stock then stalled after rising 30%.


Armstrong World's current run-up also seems out of character for the stock as it has climbed especially high in a short time vs. previous breakouts, another sign to sell some shares for a profit.

Armstrong World Tied To Cyclical Market
---------------------------------------


Another reason to question Armstrong World stock's prospects for additional gains is that it's a cyclical stock since it's linked to the housing market.


Last month, the company deepened its exposure to housing when it completed its acquisition of Architectural Components, which makes custom wood ceilings and walls.


Currently, the housing market is doing well as mortgage rates have fallen, making homebuying more affordable.


Homebuilder stocks are also rallying as well as Armstrong peers like **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) and **American Woodmark** ([AMWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMWD)).


Mortgage rates have dropped in line with the 10-year Treasury yield, which has fallen amid fears of slowing economic growth and more dovish central banks.


Indeed, the Federal Reserve indicated to investors to expect no increase in the fed funds rate in 2019 and maybe just one rate hike in 2020.


Armstrong World Stock Fundamentals
----------------------------------


To be sure, Armstrong World has had strong earnings growth, rising for 12 straight quarters. Revenue growth has also been on the uptick.


EPS growth has averaged 32% over the last three quarters and 25% over the last three years, [IBD Stock Checkup shows](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-armstrong-world-inds-awi.aspx). Armstrong World boasts an [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 96.


But in Q4, EPS was up just 1.3% at 80 cents, falling short of views for 84 cents, and revenue grew 5.3% to $239 million, in line with expectations.


Meanwhile, the company is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Building-Construction Products group. It has a 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-), putting it in the top 1% of all stocks IBD tracks.


Armstrong World has a 95 [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength), which measures a stock's price performance over the last twelve months vs. all the stocks IBD tracks.


Other highly ranked stocks in the space include **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) and **Atkore International** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)).

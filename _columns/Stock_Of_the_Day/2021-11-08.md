Top copper producer **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). FCX stock has multiple entries for experienced investors. It cleared an early buy point Monday and is also approaching a traditional breakout.




Late Friday, the House passed the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which includes $550 billion in new funding. The bill is now headed to President Joe Biden to sign.


Infrastructure-related industry groups — such as steelmakers, construction machinery companies, transportation equipment firms and metals distributors — rallied on the news.


Copper is used in building construction, machinery and electronics. It is also sometimes added to steel to prevent corrosion. Freeport-McMoRan also produces gold and molybdenum, which is used to make steel alloys.


But Wall Street analysts see copper prices falling over the next couple of years before rebounding on a push for renewable energy sources. Freeport-McMoRan is heavily influenced by commodity prices.


On Oct. 22, the mining company reported [mixed third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-earnings-q3-2021-fcx-stock/) and slightly trimmed its full-year 2021 production guidance.


FCX Stock
---------


Shares rose 6.45% to 39.43 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). FCX stock is in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 39.76 buy point, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). But more experienced investors who want to jump in early can buy Freeport stock now as it is actionable after breaking the trendline of its handle.


FCX stock was added to [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) on Monday.


However, Freeport-McMoRan's [Relative Strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has been trending lower for the past six months. The RS line compares a stock's performance with that of the S&P 500. When the RS line is climbing, this means it is outperforming the benchmark index.



FCX stock has an 85 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of a best-possible 99 and an EPS Rating of 69. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


The Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which reflects institutional buying and selling of a stock, is a B-, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-element-solutions-inc-esi.aspx). That means there is more buying than selling.

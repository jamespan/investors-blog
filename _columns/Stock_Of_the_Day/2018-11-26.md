**Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the company's relative strength shines amid a market correction that has hammered many technology stocks. The U.S. trade battle with China could provide a boost for Fabrinet stock, analysts say.




Shares of Fabrinet, a contract manufacturer specializing in optical products, are still in a buy range. Fabrinet stock has consolidated since popping nearly 16% over two trading sessions following its fiscal first-quarter earnings report on Nov. 6.


Fabrinet's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) now stands at 97 out of a possible 99, around a two-year high. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Fabrinet is linked to IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group. The group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry groups, an improvement from No. 61 a month ago. **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)), also a member of the fiber-optics group, has been [featured](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ciena-ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as an IBD Stock Of The Day. But shares in Ciena tumbled below a buy point last week amid the sell-off in technology stocks.

U.S.-China Trade Battle
-----------------------


Manufacturing is moving outside China because of tariffs placed on products imported to the U.S. Fabrinet has a manufacturing plant in Thailand.


"The tariffs in China â€” they're certainly not a headwind for us," Fabrinet CEO Seamus Grady said on a fiscal Q1 earnings call. "We do think they could be a tailwind. And while we're not building our business plan based on tariffs, it hopefully blows some business in our direction as customers who are producing in China come our way."


Fabrinet plans to build a new plant in Thailand if demand increases significantly.


The company provides manufacturing for optical components, industrial lasers and sensors.


Fabrinet's [fiscal Q1 revenue rose](http://investor.fabrinet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fabrinet-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2018-financial) 6% to $377.2 million, blowing past analyst estimates of $352 million. Profit jumped 23% to 92 cents. Analysts projected 81 cents.


Fabrinet Silicon Photonics Boost
--------------------------------


The contract manufacturer is getting a boost from an emerging technology called silicon photonics.


Silicon photonics would replace the optical devices used to transmit data by light instead of through electronics, like semiconductor chips. Silicon photonics integrates optical light switching and electronics and consumes less power.


Investment bank Cowen last year speculated that **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) is a Fabrinet customer. Intel aims to boost production of silicon photonics devices as [data centers upgrade to 400-gigabit-per-second](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-400g-silicon-photonics/), or 400G, networks in the back half of 2019.


Fabrinet has not confirmed that Intel is a customer.


In fiscal Q1, the company said silicon photonics-related revenue rose 19%. It did not disclose the revenue amount.


For the December quarter, analysts expect Fabrinet's profit to grow 28% to 92 cents. Fabrinet stock slipped 0.9% to close at 50.82 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

**Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after soaring into a buy zone amid claims that the coffee and doughnut shop could be a takeover target. Dunkin' Brands stock rose 4.35% to 76.06, moving past a 73.59 buy point in heavy volume.




The Dunkin' Donuts parent has long been seen as a potential acquisition objective for JAB Holding. Now an analyst has said **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) could potentially spark a tug-of-war for the company as it seeks to fortify its move into the java space, which saw it recently bid to acquire U.K. company Costa Coffee. The $5.1 billion move for Costa, announced Friday, is the largest brand acquisition in Coke's history.


Dunkin' Brands stock rose as high as 76.12 intraday, clearing a six-week flat base on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/).

The flat base is a key weapon in any canny investor's armory. A [flat base reflects unusual strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) in weak markets. Instead of bending lower, a stock won't cede much ground. This means a stock wants to run higher. In a solid market uptrend like now, Tuesday's retreat aside, the flat base signals that a stock doesn't want to be left behind.


Dunkin' Brands has a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) that is slightly below an all-time high. Ideally the RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, will rally into new high ground ahead of or with the share price.



Dunkin' Brands Earnings
-----------------------


The earnings growth of Dunkin' Brands has accelerated for the past two quarters, with the latest quarter's 31% EPS gain the best in years. Sales growth has been in the single digits in recent quarters. Dunkin' Brands stock boasts a solid but unspectacular [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 81.


However, it is currently lagging in 11th place in the Retail-Restaurants group. This is another potential red flag, as the L in [CAN SLIM stands for Leader vs. Laggard](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Investors should be looking for the top stocks both fundamentally and technically in the best-performing industry groups.


Dunkin' Brands Takeover In The Cards?
-------------------------------------


Privately held German conglomerate JAB Holding has long been seen as a suitor for Dunkin' Brands. JAB already owns Peet's Coffee, Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Panera Bread and Keurig.


Coca-Cola could be interested in the Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins' parent, according to Gordon Haskett analyst Don Bilson. The analyst cited the soft drinks giant's takeover deal last week for Costa Coffee.


"Of course, Dunkin' is breaking in a new CEO at the moment and we assumed back in July when this move was finalized that Dunkin' was planning on remaining independent, at least for a while," Bilson said in a research note released Tuesday. "We aren't in any rush to amend that thought, but Coke's purchase does up the ante in the coffee wars and, as we see it, Dunkin' is now a strategic asset that JAB and Coke both may want."


Larger rival **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), which has struggled with U.S. same-store sales growth for several quarters, was little changed Tuesday afternoon. Starbucks stock has been in a downtrend for the past 15 months, with its RS line slumping since early 2016.

Volatile Trade Desk Earnings Reports
------------------------------------


Trade Desk has been volatile when reporting financial results, diving in November 2023 and popping in February.


The company's fourth-quarter earnings rose 8% to 41 cents a share from a year earlier, in-line with consensus estimates.


Revenue rose 23% to $1.95 billion last year. Analysts polled by FactSet project 23% sales growth again in 2024, then dipping to 19.6% in 2025.


After popping on fourth-quarter earnings, Trade Desk stock forged a cup-with-handle base, with an 89.88 buy point. Trade Desk stock is about 3% below the entry point as of today.


Shares retreated in early March as investors weighed the outlook for digital advertising growth in 2024. Internet TV has been a growth driver for Trade Desk stock as more video streaming services become advertising supported.


Trade Desk's ad platform supports video streaming **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and others.


Disney Upside, Amazon Risk?
---------------------------


Shares in Trade Desk popped March 21 after Disney announced a new Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX) programmatic ad sales platform. Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and Trade Desk were named as initial partners for the digital ad platform, which combines streaming ad inventory across Hulu and Disney+.


"We see this deeper Disney partnership as a modest incremental positive," said Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Cost in a recent report. "We believe this announcement is one additional data point showing the value that the market ascribes to TTD's product and is ultimately bullish for its ability to gain market share in internet TV going forward."


On the other hand, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has been an overhang on Trade Desk stock. Amazon Prime has expanded its ad-supported video streaming, offering big brands an alternative to Trade Desk customers.


"We believe fears over the Amazon Prime Video's ad-supported launch are overblown," Jefferies James Heaney said in a recent report. "We would expect Amazon will pull more budget away from linear (broadcast) TV than it will from existing internet TV budgets being transacted through TTD. In our view, TTD's key advertisers are unlikely to shift significant budget into Amazon Prime Video, particularly not in the near-term."

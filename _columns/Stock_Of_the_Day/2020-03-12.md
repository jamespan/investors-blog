**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the software leader's cloud-computing business gives it a cushion amid the [coronavirus-driven market correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/). Microsoft stock fell Thursday, but not as badly as other stocks in the broad sell-off.




The Redmond, Wash.-based company has a more resilient business model since it pivoted to cloud computing and software-as-a-service. Microsoft stock has demonstrated to be an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-long-term-stocks/). That's especially clear when looking at the monthly chart for MSFT stock using [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Microsoft stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93. The RS Rating tracks a stock's share price performance over the last 52 weeks, and then compares the result with that of all other stocks.


In a positive sign, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Microsoft stock is at a record high. RS lines near highs show a stock that is steadily outpacing the general market.

Microsoft Ranks Second In Industry Group
----------------------------------------


Microsoft stock ranks second out of seven stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-corp-msft.aspx). Digital media and marketing software maker **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is first in the group.



Microsoft stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


On Oct. 28, Microsoft stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 142.47. It climbed to an all-time high of 190.70 on Feb. 11 before the market turned south.


[Buying stocks in this market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/), however, is not advised. Also, one [key IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) is to not let a double-digit gain from a proper buy point vanish completely.


Microsoft Stock Looks Attractive After 'Haircut'
------------------------------------------------


On Tuesday, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said Microsoft stock looks attractive after getting a "haircut" in the correction. Microsoft "is compelling at these levels," he said in a note to clients.


"While volatility and white knuckles will rule the day for the coming days/weeks, etc., we believe MSFT remains the best way to play the transformational cloud shift for the coming years," Ives said.


While roughly a third of Microsoft's revenue is exposed to personal computers and the hardware supply chain, most of its business value is tied to software and services such as Azure and Office 365, he said.


Ives reiterated his outperform rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 210.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Microsoft stock dropped 9.5% to 139.06.

**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the beauty and hair care retailer delivers consistently solid earnings and sales growth. Ulta Beauty stock tested a buy point Monday after a post-earnings shakeout. Investors might prefer an alternative entry, though.




The Illinois-based firm is one of the leading beauty retailers in the United States. It operates 1,174 stores, and increased its total square footage by 9.2% on 2018. Its product range includes cosmetics, fragrance, skin care, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. It sells more than 20,000 products across all categories and price points.


One way it stands out from competitors is the fact each store offers a full service with hair, skin and brow services. This experiential approach is paying off. The firm enjoys robust revenue growth and has outperformed its broader industry in the past three months.


While not Amazon proof, Ulta Beauty stock has been Amazon resistant over the years.


Ulta Beauty Stock Technical Analysis
------------------------------------


Shares fell 1.25% to 350.19 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/) after rising to 357.54 in morning trade. Ulta Beauty stock briefly cleared a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) buy point of 354.72, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The base is shallow and second stage. Early-stage bases are more likely to result in successful breakouts.


However, Ulta Beauty stock isn't acting like 354.72 is a decisive resistance area, with shares inching up and down in light volume. Investors may want to see the stock clear the left hand side of the consolidation, with that buy point at 359.79. Alternatively, Ulta Beauty stock could form a handle, offering yet another entry, but hasn't really gotten started with that.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been moving sideways at record highs as Ulta Beauty stock has consolidated.


Ulta Beauty stock is on the [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).

Estee Lauder Stock Also Near Buy Point
--------------------------------------


Cosmetics maker **Estee Lauder** ([EL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EL)) also is closing on a possible buy point. Estee Lauder stock rose 0.4% to 177.62, close to a 180.30 buy point from a shallow cup base. Estee Lauder stock could be in the process of forming a handle, which would offer a slightly lower buy point.


Ulta Beauty Earnings Strong
---------------------------


Ulta Beauty stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of 99, with earnings a key factor.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ulta-beauty-inc-ulta.aspx) shows that over the last three years, Ulta Beauty earnings have grown at a rate of 29%, above [CAN SLIM requirements](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) for 25% growth. Revenue growth has been a healthy 19%.


Ulta Beauty earnings rose 17% in the first quarter, just above forecasts, while revenue rose an in-line 13%. The firm also backed its full-year outlook for adjusted EPS of $12.65-$12.85, with total sales growth in the low double digits and comp sales growth of 6% to 7%.


[Ulta Beauty shares plunged](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-earnings-q1-2019-ulta-stock-kylie-lip-kits/) as much 7.4% after Q1 earnings, but closed the session up 1.5%.


Ulta sells Kylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner, of Kardashian clan fame, in store. The lip kits had previously only been available online. Jenner launched a new skin care line earlier this year, but so far Ulta Beauty only sells the lip kits and eye shadow palettes. The firm also sells other top brands like Anastasia Beverly Hills.

Analyst Rates Ulta Beauty Stock
-------------------------------


Jefferies senior analyst Stephanie Wissink rated Ulta Beauty stock as a buy with a 370 target on May 30. She pointed toward its in-store experience and product assortment as strengths.


"ULTA defied flat-to-down industry trends in Q1, developing an assortment of in-demand brands and an in-store experience that continues to widen the share and leadership gap with direct and indirect competitors," she said in a research note last month. "Mass cosmetics, fragrance, and prestige skin care delivered (positive) double-digit comps — a reflection of distinct assortment attributes."


Wissink sees opportunities for the firm in areas including personalization, comps rates and sales blends between products and services.

**Louisiana-Pacific** ([LPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as lumber prices rise signaling inflation concerns following a bust this summer. LPX stock is rebounding above an early entry.




Nashville-based Louisiana-Pacific makes wood building products like siding and trim. The stock is linked heavily to the price of lumber.


Lumber has been on a roller-coaster ride during the pandemic. Prices surged this spring amid a homebuilding boom and as homeowners tackled improvement projects. Lumber prices plunged in August as supply increased, but now they are on the rise again.

LPX Stock

Shares rose 2.9% to 65.76 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), hitting an intraday high of 67.49. LPX stock is flashing a buy signal after breaking a trend line in its consolidation. Investors could use Monday's close of 63.88 as the buy point. Investors also could use 66.15, just above the Aug. 30 high, as a resistance point.


The overall market is in a correction with a rally attempt hitting some resistance. So investors need to be cautious when adding to their portfolios.


However, commodity-related sectors are faring relatively well. Louisiana-Pacific is tied closely to lumber prices, so investors have more flexibility in adding to commodity plays when the commodity price is rising.



The company will release third-quarter results on Nov. 2. FactSet analysts see Louisiana-Pacific earnings soaring 131% to $3.60 per share with revenue up 42% to $1.13 billion. Those would actually mark big slowdowns in growth rates, reflecting tougher year-over-year comparisons.


LPX stock has a 96 Composite Rating out of a best possible 99, and a 98 EPS Rating.


Louisiana-Pacific is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Building-Wood Products group. Other stocks in the group include **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) and **UFP Industries** ([UFPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UFPI)).


The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.

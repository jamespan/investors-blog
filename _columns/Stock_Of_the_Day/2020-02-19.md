AYX Stock: Earnings Beat Estimates
----------------------------------


On Friday, Alteryx reported fourth-quarter results well above estimates. Revenue jumped 75% to $156.5 million, vs. estimates of $130 million. Adjusted earnings of 64 cents crushed views of 29 cents. For the first quarter of 2020, it expects revenue in the range of $105 million to $108 million. That's an increase of 38% to 42% year over year.


FactSet shows a consensus top-line view of $107.7 million.


The company has consistently showed double-digit revenue growth going back more than four years. In 2019, Alteryx revenue grew 65% to $418 million.


Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter jumped 100% from the year-ago period. That marks three straight quarters of rising earnings performance. The company also has posted rising revenue growth in each of the last three quarterly reports.


The massive volumes of information generated and used for decision making in business today fuel the booming business of data analytics and Big Data companies. The application of data analytics affects organizations across practically every industry and takes an active part in developing strategies for their success.


Next Wave Of Digital Transformation
-----------------------------------


"Competing, let alone winning, in this data-driven world requires global enterprises to either disrupt themselves or be disrupted by others," Alteryx Chief Executive Dean Stoecker said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts after it reported earnings**.** "We believe that this next wave of digital transformation efforts by global organizations will help fuel our growth for years to come."


Following the earnings report, Needham analyst Jack Andrews raised his price target on AYX stock to 167, from 151, with a buy rating.


"Our key takeaway moving forward is that Alteryx appears to be broadening its addressable market opportunity by leveraging new relationships, addressing a new user base, with new use cases," Andrews wrote in a note to clients.


Organizations of all sizes and across a wide variety of industries and geographies have adopted the Alteryx platform. Alteryx had about 6,100 customers at the end of 2019, in more than 90 countries. It added 1,400 customers last year. Customers include **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Nasda**q ([NDAQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NDAQ)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)).

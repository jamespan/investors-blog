ServiceNow Stock On Leaderboard
-------------------------------


ServiceNow is on the exclusive [IBD Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/sectorleaders) of top-performing companies and is on the [IBD 50 list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full). It holds an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99, the highest possible.


Despite a tumultuous year in the stock market, ServiceNow stock was up 37% in 2018 and has been consolidating for the past three months. It has morphed from a potential double-bottom base into an undefined consolidation. ServiceNow stock currently trades above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


According to Leaderboard analysis, much of the base formed below the 50-day average, which makes the pattern weak. On the plus side, the stock has reset the base count after a deep drop below the bottom of the earlier base. So any breakout from here would be first stage, which means it could have a stronger follow-through than a later stage base.



The buy point on ServiceNow stock is 206.39, with a buy range up to 216.71.


The stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 88. That means it has outperformed nearly nine out of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 index. Also providing support for ServiceNow stock is speculation it could be acquired. Plus, it's expanding from its core market into new software tools.

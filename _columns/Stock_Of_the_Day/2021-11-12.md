Eli Lilly stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as froth lifts makers of Alzheimer's drugs, including rivals like **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Cassava Sciences** ([SAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVA)).




This week, the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's disease meeting highlighted new research. **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) offered two presentations centered on its experimental Alzheimer's drug, donanemab. One compared the cost-effectiveness of donanemab against Biogen's approved drug, Aduhelm.


And investors will soon get a look at head-to-head data pitting donanemab against Aduhelm in patients with early, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat called the pending study the "holy grail" of drug development.


Both drugs work by targeting the buildup of beta amyloid, an abnormal protein in Alzheimer's brains. Aduhelm gained approval based on this mechanism, but Biogen still has to prove clearing those plaques leads to a benefit on cognition.

Eli Lilly Stock: Shares Form Base
---------------------------------


On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Eli Lilly stock slipped 1.1% to 259.65. Shares are forming a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) base and a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 271.21, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Lilly shares enjoyed a run-up earlier this year after Biogen gained FDA approval for Aduhelm. Evercore ISI's Raffat noted donanemab clears beta amyloid faster than Aduhelm. The timing of the study's results could buoy Eli Lilly stock and damage Biogen stock.


"Is Lilly hoping to have an earlier time-point from this (study) to read out shortly into the launch (of donanemab)?" he said. "Possibly."



Analysts still don't see especially bullish growth for Lilly in 2022. Sales are expected to inch a tad higher, before popping in 2023 and 2024, according to FactSet.


Representatives of Lilly didn't immediately return a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.

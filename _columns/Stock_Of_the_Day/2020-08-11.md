**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after rising above an early entry and closing in on an official buy point. That follows archrival **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which broke out last week, while digital payments leaders **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) have been big winners.




[Visa posted earnings and revenue that managed to beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-earnings-q3-2020-mastercard-earnings-q2-2020/), despite sharp declines due to the impact of Covid-19.


Payment volumes have been recovering, though investors should note the firm's cross-border business remains weak. This comes despite strength from e-commerce. Analysts believe this will weigh on growth in the near term.


Visa Stock Analysis
-------------------


Shares of Visa rose 0.5% to 197.77 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), fading with the major indexes into the close after hitting 202.89 intraday. For much of Tuesday's session, the Dow Jones stock cleared a 201.05 early entry. Visa briefly cleared a 202.28 conventional buy point after building a flat base, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Visa and many "real economy" stocks got a boost Tuesday as Russia approved a coronavirus vaccine, though it has yet to undergo late-stage trials. Meanwhile, **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) and **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) may seek regulatory approval for their experimental Covid-19 vaccine in October.


Successful coronavirus vaccines will let the U.S. and global economy get back to work and consumers to return to pre-pandemic shopping and traveling trends.


Investors should note the mediocre performance of the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Visa. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been trending lower since late May, though it is once again showing signs of life. Investors can give some leeway to a lagging RS line if an out-of-favor group or sector is coming to the fore.


Visa stock has an [IBD Composite Rating of 78](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Earnings remain a strong point. The company has an EPS Rating of 88, though Visa earnings fell 23% in the latest quarter amid the coronavirus crisis



The [Stock Checkup Tool shows](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-visa-inc-cl-a-v.aspx) that Visa earnings have been robust longer term. EPS rose by an average of 20% over the past three years. While [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) look for 25% growth, 20% is still good for such a big company.


Visa has been lagging some other payment stocks, such as PayPal, Square and Warren Buffett-backed Brazilian firm **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)). Meanwhile, rival payment network and [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) **Mastercard** is still within buy range.


Analyst Backs Stock Of The Day
------------------------------


Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri is rating Visa stock as outperform with a 220 target. He sees solid performance ahead.


"Fundamentally, looking at Visa's portfolio of growth drivers, incremental strength in e-commerce transaction volumes, solid performance in value-added services continue to somewhat offset weak cross-border (travel) trends as well as weak transaction from point of sale/brick and mortar merchants," he said in a July 29 research note.


Katri also noted that, since the end of June, positive trends in U.S. credit and debit have reversed. This is due to some states reversing business reopening plans. The benefits of stimulus checks are also winding down.

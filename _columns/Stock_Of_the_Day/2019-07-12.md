Telecom equipment supplier **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Ciena stock is trading near an 11-year high after the **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) acquisition of **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) raised the profile of its peers.




Ciena is the largest company by market value in IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group. But it ranks No. 3 in the group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ciena-corporation-cien.aspx). **Viavi Solutions** ([VIAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIAV)) is the top-rated stock in the group, followed by Acacia. Ciena stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Ciena stock rose 0.2% to 44.08. It has been consolidating for five weeks, the minimum for a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/). The chart shows a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 46.33, according to [IBD's Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) analysis.


Ciena stock stalled after a powerful surge following its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on [June 6](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ciena-earnings-ciena-stock-q22019/). It soared 26.8% the day after its posted better-than-expected results for the quarter ended April 30.

Ciena Stock Could Be Beneficiary Of Consolidation
-------------------------------------------------


The Hanover, Md.-based company earned 48 cents a share on sales of $865 million in fiscal Q2. On a year-over-year basis, earnings rose 109% while sales climbed 18%. Analysts expected Ciena to earn 40 cents a share on sales of $816 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ciena sells networking systems, software and services.


Ciena and other optical networking stocks got a boost on Tuesday after Cisco announced a deal to [buy Acacia](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/optical-networking-stocks-rise-cisco-purchase-acacia/) for $2.6 billion in cash.


In a report Wednesday, Jefferies analyst George Notter said Ciena could be the "primary beneficiary" of market-share consolidation in the optical systems industry, following Cisco's purchase of Acacia.


Bigger R&D Budgets Needed For Optical Networking
------------------------------------------------


Optical innovation is happening rapidly and is requiring larger research and development spending, Notter said.


"As such, smaller optical suppliers will increasingly struggle to keep up with vendors such as Ciena and **Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)), which have sizable R&D budgets, own their core technology and operate in scaled business models," he said. "We view Ciena as having reached an 'escape velocity' relative to the rest of the industry."


While Cisco has promised to support current and future Acacia customers, some customers are likely to look for other suppliers, analysts say.


"We believe this transaction will be favorable for Ciena and allow the company to capture incremental market share," Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen said in a report Tuesday.

**NMI Holdings** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the stock chases a new buy point amid strong momentum for its private mortgage insurance business.




The firm, which is better known as National MI, provides a key service to the housing market. Its policies protect lenders from defaults on mortgages. This helps expand the number of loans available, making it easier for more Americans to buy homes.


The housing market also remains strong, with sales of existing homes rising year over year for four straight months. On Wednesday, Fannie Mae predicted that growth in single-family housing starts will accelerate to 10% next year from 1% this year.


NMIH stock surged by 10% in massive volume on Nov. 7 after the firm posted a big beat on the top and bottom lines. And with the firm saying the outlook is positive, it looks set for more gains. At its earnings call last month, management was optimistic about both the macroeconomic environment and the outlook for the mortgage insurance market.


"We see continued strength in our insured borrowers driven by record low unemployment, strong wage growth and sustained home price appreciation," Executive Chairman Brad Shuster said. "In fact, this is the first time in more than 50 years that both national unemployment and mortgage rates are below 4%, a dynamic that sets up well for both new business flow and the credit performance of our in-force portfolio going forward."

This New Product Helps NMIH Stock
---------------------------------


A key part of the [CAN SLIM formula is the N](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), which stands for new products, service or management.


Management changed when Claudia Merkle took over as CEO in January. She previously served as president of the company and had been an employee since it was founded in 2012. Founder Brad Shuster moved aside from the role, but continues to serve as executive chairman.


Merkle has overseen the rollout of a new product as well. In June 2018, National MI launched Rate GPS, a risk-based pricing platform. It assesses a variety of loan characteristics to more closely align National MI's premium rates to the risk associated with individual loans.


During the November earnings call, Merkle said more than 95% of its lenders use the platform, and that more than 90% of Q3 new insurance written volume was delivered through the engine.


Another key component of CAN SLIM is the I, which stands for institutional sponsorship. Some 50% of NMIH shares are held by institutions, with 57 funds opening new positions in Q3 alone.


Among those new funds is Primecap Odyssey, which is rated as one of the top funds by [IBD founder William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) and holds 2.8 million shares.


NMIH Stock Analysis
-------------------


Shares closed up 1.3% at 34.45 on the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), just below [a buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 34.60 and on track to forming a flat base soon.


A positive sign for NMIH stock is the fact it found support at its 10-week line before staging a strong rebound, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The relative strength line is also looking mighty. It is near record highs and has been making powerful progress throughout 2019.



NMIH stock has an excellent [IBD Composite Rating of 98](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). Its strong performance has seen it land a spot as one of just six on the [Sector Leaders list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) — IBD's strictest stock screen.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-n-m-i-holdings-inc-cl-a-nmih.aspx) shows the stock has a heady mixture of fundamental and technical performance. Both earnings and sales growth have been excellent. Earnings have grown by an average of 55% over the past three quarters. In addition, EPS accelerated in the last quarter. The three-year earnings growth rate is even better, coming in at 181%. CAN SLIM cognoscenti look for growth of 25% over both these time scales.

**Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the retailer's shares approach a buy point. That comes as several other discounters and the broader retail sector shine.




The off-price apparel chain, which was founded in 1924, operates over 630 stores across 45 states in the U.S. [Formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/off-price-retailer-burlington-looks-to-become-weather-resistant/), Burlington Stores has since expanded its product assortment, reducing its reliance on seasonal apparel and joining **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) as an off-price heavyweight.

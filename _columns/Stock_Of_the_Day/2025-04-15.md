Earnings Expectations For MercadoLibre
--------------------------------------


While MercadoLibre may have less direct exposure to U.S. tariff policy, analysts are debating how the business can perform if global trade slows.


Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt on Tuesday cut price targets for companies across his e-commerce coverage. He cited "ongoing macro concerns, potential tariff implications, and weaker consumer confidence levels both in the U.S. and internationally," as described in a client note Tuesday.


He lowered his price target for MercadoLibre stock to 2,400, down from 2,600 previously.


In MercadoLibre's home market of Argentina, President Javier Milei [announced last week](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-economy-inflation-milei-imf-consumer-prices-currency-8ca2cc2b1a2b025e8913f8ae85cd7170) that he would lift most of the country's strict capital and currency controls next week after receiving a $20 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.


However, Mexico has greater risk from U.S. tariffs and [some economists](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-inflation-slows-activity-weakens-ahead-rate-decision-2025-03-24/) are predicting a recession.


MercadoLibre is expected to report first quarter earnings early next month. Analysts project the company's sales will increase 26% year-over-year for the quarter to $5.5 billion, according to FactSet's consensus tally. Adjusted earnings are projected to increase 21% to $8.29 per share.


MercadoLibre stock gained following its fourth-quarter report in mid February. Adjusted earnings increased 286% to $12.61 per share while revenue increased 37% to $6.1 billion.

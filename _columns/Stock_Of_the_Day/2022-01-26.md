**Concentrix** ([CNXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNXC)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the call-center operator nears an entry point amid early 2022 carnage in the tech sector.




Spun off in late 2020 by **Synnex** ([SNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNX)), Concentrix stock recently forged a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/). The double-bottom chart pattern looks sort of like the letter "W." It features two distinct sell-offs.


In addition, CNCX stock has registered a number of high-volume gains the past few weeks. As a result, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/) of CNXC stock is basically at highs.


It compares the stock's daily price performance to the S&P 500. An upward-sloping RS line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. A downward-sloping line means the stock is lagging the S&P 500.


Concentrix stock holds an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 187.04.


CNXC stock hosted an analyst day on Jan. 25 and provided long-term guidance. The company expects annual organic revenue growth of at least 9% from 2023 to 2025, with total revenue exceeding $10 billion by 2025.


Concentrix Stock Out-Performs Software Sector Benchmark
-------------------------------------------------------


Shares of Concentrix were up nearly 3% to close at 181.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). CNXC stock has edged up nearly 2% in 2022. Meanwhile, a closely watched software benchmark — the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) has contracted 15%.


Shares in Fremont, Calif.-based Concentrix hit an all-time high of 191.35 on Nov. 18 last year. More companies outsourced call center operations that handle customer support amid the coronavirus pandemic.


Concentrix competes in the call-center business versus Alorica, Teleperformance and others. The company describes itself as a "global provider of customer experience solutions and technology."


Synnex Spun Off Concentrix Stock In 2020
----------------------------------------


Synnex decided to spin off Concentrix in December 2020. Meanwhile, Synnex retained a computer and electronics distribution business.


The call center services business had been consolidating. Then Synnex agreed to buy Cincinnati-based Convergys for $2.4 billion in mid-2018.


In the November quarter, Concentrix said revenue rose nearly 13% to $1.466 billion while adjusted earnings rose 44% to $2.99 per share. Analysts had projected revenue of $1.46 billion.


For the current quarter ending in February, the company forecast revenue in a range of $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion, about 3% above analyst estimates at the midpoint of the company's guidance.


Concentrix Accumulation/Distribution Rating
-------------------------------------------


Concentrix stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of 90 out of a best possible 99.


In addition, Concentrix holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-concentrix-corporation-cnxc.aspx).

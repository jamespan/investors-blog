**Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the farm supply retailer broke out powerfully after announcing strong first-quarter earnings and a bullish second-quarter outlook late Tuesday.




Tractor Supply is based in Brentwood, Tenn., and operates more than 2,000 retail stores in 49 states. It doesn't just sell farming equipment; it also offers pet supplies, power tools and lawn and garden supplies. Many of its customers are "hobby farmers" rather than full-blown agricultural operations.


Late Tuesday, the retailer reported that first-quarter earnings rose 13% to 71 cents a share, the best year-over-year gain in five quarters. Revenue grew 8% to $1.9592 billion, the best advance in four quarters. Analysts expected Tractor Supply earnings of 70 cents on sales of $1.96 billion.


But the big news was second-quarter guidance. Tractor Supply said it sees "record-breaking sales and earnings" and comparable-store sales growth of 20% to 25% as it remains an essential business during the coronavirus pandemic. It sees diluted earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. That would be a 42% EPS gain at the midpoint. Analysts had expected Tractor Supply earnings of $1.77, down 2%.


"Our outlook for record-breaking sales and earnings in the second quarter demonstrates the potential for Tractor Supply to emerge stronger than before as we continue to gain market share and build our business for the future," CEO Hal Lawton said in a release.


Analysts are bullish on rural suppliers like Tractor Supply continuing to see a boost in sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic.


"We believe rural markets are and will continue to reap the benefits of consumers moving/vacationing away from their more urban counterparts, which ideally fits the rural nature of Tractor Supply's store base," Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock wrote in a note Wednesday.


Raymond James has a buy rating on Tractor Supply and raised its price target on the stock to 135 from 115.

Semiconductor Stocks Called Oversold
------------------------------------


Earlier on Tuesday, in a note to clients, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar changed his tone on semiconductor stocks. He moved to a positive stance from a cautious position on the sector after a sell-off in chip stocks this year.Â The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or SOX, was down about 26% as of Monday's close.


"We feel it is prudent to start buying great companies given the current pullback," Kumar said. "We are a bit baffled by the steep declines in semiconductor stocks as of late."


Kumar reiterated his overweight, or buy, rating on AVGO stock with a price target of 750.


AVGO Stock Ranks Second In Group
--------------------------------


Broadcom ranks second out of 34 semiconductor stocks in IBD's fabless chipmaker industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-broadcom-inc-avgo.aspx). AVGO stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


AVGO stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92. That puts it in the top 8% of stocks for performance over the past 12 months.


The next potential catalyst for Broadcom stock is the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report, due June 2.

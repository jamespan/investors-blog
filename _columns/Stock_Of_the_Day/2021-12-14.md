**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the highflying EV maker is entering a critical point as it breaks below key levels. On Tuesday, Tesla stock fell, but slashed intraday losses.




Tesla stock raced up 38% from its [cup-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) buy point of 900.50 in late October, after posting [blockbuster quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-on-tap-ev-demand-surges-amid-chip-shortage-supply-chain-woes/). Earnings per share surged 145%, while sales jumped 57% to 13.8 billion, topping views. The U.S.-based EV maker delivered 241,300 vehicles in Q3, up from 201,250 in the previous quarter and racing past estimates of 232,000. Analysts expect 260,000 or more in the current Q4.


But nearly all of that 38% gain is gone now. Tesla stock undercut last week's lows on Tuesday after closing below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on Monday. Recent investors should have been cashing in some of their gains by now.


Longer-term investors might have more runway. But even though some investors might be used to Tesla's history of major corrections, it might still be prudent to [lock in some gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/).

**Musk Stock Sales Pressure Stock**
-----------------------------------


Tesla stock has been hammered lately, as CEO Elon Musk continues to offload stock, while exercising options to buy more shares at a deep discount. Tesla stock gapped down nearly 5% on Nov. 8, after Musk polled Twitter followers about selling a chunk of his Tesla shares.


Musk sold 934,091 Tesla shares on Monday, which are worth around $906.5 million. He also exercised options to buy 2.134 million Tesla shares at the strike price of $6.24 per share.


So far in December, Musk sold more than $2.87 billion worth of TSLA stock. He sold a total of $9.85 billion in Tesla stock in November.


Musk needs to sell about 5 million more shares to achieve his stated goal of selling 10% of his Tesla stake.


**Tesla Stock**
---------------


Tesla stock fell 0.8% to 958.51 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) after tumbling to 930 intraday. Shares traded as high as 1,243.49 on Nov. 4, but the stock is 24% off its 52-week high, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Retaking its 50-day line wouldn't be enough to trigger an early entry. Drawing a trend line from the record high could offer an early entry around 1,150. Tesla stock could also have a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) are after this week that would have a 1,202.05 buy point.



But with the market in correction, investors are cautioned against taking new positions or adding to existing ones.


Tesla's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending lower, however its [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is holding at 96 out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 72.


Among Tesla's U.S.-based EV startup rivals, **Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) dropped 1.5%. **Lucid** ([LCID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCID)) rose 4.4%.


U.S. legacy automakers expanding their EV offerings [**General Motors**](https://www.investors.com/research/gm-stock-buy-now/) ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) declined 1.2% and **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) fell 1.8%. Both have wiped out Friday's big gains.


Tesla's China-based competitors [**Nio**](https://www.investors.com/news/nio-stock-buy-now/) ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) lost 4%, **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) fell 1.9%.


**Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) sank 1%. LI stock is down 12% so far this month, while Nio and Xpeng have slumped nearly 20%.


Wall Street Bullish, But Headwinds Remain
-----------------------------------------


While Wall Street is still bullish about Tesla's outlook, there are still challenges ahead. Chip shortages, while improving, may still take some time to completely disappear. And when those chip woes disappear, overall auto industry production should rebound, reducing pricing power for Tesla and others.


Meanwhile, Tesla's Berlin plant is slated to open soon, but production won't ramp up well into 2022. Last week, Tesla told Model S and Model X order holders in Europe that it now expects [deliveries in international markets](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-on-tap-ev-demand-surges-amid-chip-shortage-supply-chain-woes/) to start during the second half of 2022.


Tesla is likely trying to reduce its backlog. It has had no new Model S/X shipments in Europe and other markets in a year, because it shut down production of those models in January of last year to update the vehicles.


Additionally, competition from domestic startups Rivian and Lucid as well as GM and Ford is expected to increase. **Toyota** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)) just announced a major, belated EV push. Chinese startups Nio, Li Auto and Xpeng are also nipping at Tesla's heels.






Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says Tesla will continue to be the leader in the EV space, but that "a slew of winners" will emerge as well.


"We believe on the OEM front that Tesla is in pole position to expand its capacity (Berlin, Austin) and exceed 50% YoY unit demand growth in 2022, while pure plays like Rivian will help pave the way for a new EV market on pickups and SUVs along with Ford and its game changing F-150 Lightning," he wrote in a recent note to clients.

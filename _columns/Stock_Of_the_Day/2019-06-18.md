Universal Display Stock Surges In June
--------------------------------------


The Ewing, N.J.-based company has been on a tear this month. Last month, its shares spiked after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter results on May 2. But it retreated along with the overall market.


Universal Display earned 66 cents a share, up 408% year over year, on sales of $87.8 million, up 101%, in the [March quarter](https://ir.oled.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Universal-Display-Corporation-Announces-First-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results/). Analysts were looking for 26 cents in earnings per share and $61 million in sales, according to Zacks Investment Research.


IBD has given Universal Display a [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) rating of 97, meaning its shares outperform 97% of all stocks. Its overall [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a collection of a variety of metrics, stands at 96. The company ranks first in IBD's Electronic-Miscellaneous Products group, which stands at 59th out of 197 groups.


'Strong Momentum' For OLED Screen Products
------------------------------------------


The company noted strong momentum in the industry for its organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, technology and materials. Its OLED products are used in smartphones, wearables and televisions as well as lighting products.


Key customers include display makers Samsung and **LG Display** ([LPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPL)). Because OLED displays are flexible, the company foresees a growing market for folding and curved displays.


Analysts say **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is likely to expand its lineup of OLED smartphones when it announces its new iPhone lineup this fall.


For the current quarter, analysts expect Universal Display to earn 46 cents a share on sales of $77 million, Zacks said. That would represent year-over-year growth of 100% in earnings and 38% in sales.

**Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Friday. Shares of the social media player are pushing past a cup-with-handle [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) with gains in morning action.


San Francisco-based Reddit's user forum website boasts more than 340 million weekly active users, who post across more than 100,000 Reddit communities. The 19-year-old firm completed an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) in March.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Reddit stock is up 4.5% to 70.57 in recent action. Friday's heavy-volume trading action is pushing shares above a 69.11 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) buy point, as identified by IBD [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/mstool).


Reddit stock has climbed to double the value of its initial public offering price of 34 in March, with some ups and downs along the way. Reddit [popped nearly 50%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-ipo-social-media-nyse-debut/) on its first trading day before pulling back to a mid-April low point. Shares climbed to a record high near 78 in mid-July before a late summer swoon. The social media stock bounced back with a strong September.


Reddit Ad Tools Gaining Traction?
---------------------------------


While it has recently started licensing its content to artificial intelligence developers, Reddit's main source of revenue is digital advertising. It is a small operation compared to industry giants **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)). Ahead of its IPO, [Reddit added tools](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-ipo-social-media-nyse-debut/) to smooth the buying process for advertisers. Analysts see Reddit's offering gaining traction with online ad-buyers.


Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion rates Reddit a positive overweight with a price target of 70. In a client note Thursday Champion, citing industry metrics, said Reddit's platform "continue(s) to show sequential user growth and lower pricing," for advertising.


Analysts with Citi, meanwhile, recently called Reddit a stock to watch in digital advertising. Reddit has "quickly become one of the most talked about actors in the space," the Citi client note said, according to a description from [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-amazon-uber-alphabet-stock-6049cb40).


The next test for Reddit will come Oct. 29, when it reports third-quarter earnings. Analysts polled by FactSet project Reddit will report a loss of 9 cents per share from sales of $309 million. That would represent a year-over-year revenue increase of 49%.


Reddit has stated its goal is to soon reach profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Helped by a 54% jump in revenue, Reddit narrowed its net loss to $10.1 million in the second quarter, compared to $41.1 million a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Drew Vollero told the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-sets-its-sights-on-turning-a-profit-boosted-by-targeted-ads-data-licensing-ba53cfcf) last month that Reddit's "financials are inflecting and becoming very profitable, very quickly."


Analysts see GAAP profits arriving with Reddit's fourth-quarter results. The Wall Street consensus estimate, as tracked by FactSet, sees Reddit earning of 6-cents per share for its December-ending quarter.

Chip Shortages A Tailwind For ASML Stock
----------------------------------------


"Compared to three months ago, we are seeing a significant increase in demand across all market segments and our product portfolio," Chief Executive Peter Wennink said in a [news release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/21/2213809/0/en/ASML-reports-4-4-billion-net-sales-and-1-3-billion-net-income-in-Q1-2021.html) Wednesday. "The buildup of the digital infrastructure with secular growth drivers such as 5G, AI and high-performance computing solutions fuels demand for advanced and mature nodes in logic (chips) as well as memory."


ASML now expects revenue growth of about 30% in 2021, Wennink said. The company previously guided to "double-digit" growth for the year.


Key customers such as **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), Samsung and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) have increased their capital investment plans in recent weeks in response to heightened chip demand and shortages.


Netherlands-based ASML makes advanced lithography equipment for etching tiny circuits onto semiconductors.


CFRA Research analyst Jun Zhang Tan on Wednesday upgraded ASML stock to buy from hold. He also raised his 12-month price target on its U.S. shares to 745 from 540.


"While it was widely anticipated the global semiconductor shortage will benefit ASML, the strength of the benefit is much stronger than market expectation," Tan said in a note to clients.


ASML's bookings are showing the "early signs of an order tsunami," Robert Maire, president of Semiconductor Advisors, said in his note to clients.

CAT stock, a bellwether for the global economy, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the construction and mining equipment giant broke out to a record high. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, joined a global rally among cyclical stocks, as copper prices ascended to a new eight-year high and the 10-year Treasury yield darted to its highest level since before the Covid lockdown.




While the broad stock market rally paused as investors digested the higher rates, industrial stocks took the lead. CAT stock was among the biggest Dow Jones gainers on Tuesday afternoon, behind only **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), on a strong day for financial stocks.


Vaccines, Stimulus Boost Caterpillar, Materials Stocks
------------------------------------------------------


With the impeachment trial over, attention has turned to President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal expected to clear Congress in coming weeks. Covid cases and hospitalizations in the U.S. have plunged from their December peak. Meanwhile, global oil and industrial metals prices have been buoyed by the improving outlook and demand from China amid restrained supply. The next step of the Biden agenda, which will likely include a massive infrastructure package, should provide further fuel for the industrial recovery.


After being closed for Presidents Day on Monday, Wall Street played catch-up to the global reflationary mood. **BHP Group** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) helped get the party started as the Australia-based mining giant issued a bullish outlook as it posted a seven-year-best profit for the first half of its fiscal year through Dec. 31. "We expect the demand-supply balance to remain relatively tight in both iron ore and copper. The balance of risks for oil prices (is) tilted upwards."


As BHP jumped 7.25%, copper play **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) skipped ahead 5.35%. **Terex** ([TEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEX)) and **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) were among other equipment stocks shining on Tuesday, up 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively. Steel stocks also got a bid. **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) surged 12%, while **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) rose 4.7%.


CAT Stock Analysis
------------------


CAT stock gapped up and rose as high as 205.07, before easing back to 202.38, up 2.2%. The prior high of 200.17 came on Jan. 13, as momentum sparked by the Democrats' Jan. 5 Senate runoff victories began to fade.


The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) for CAT stock is 10 cents above that prior high at 200.27. The 5% chase zone, a limit that helps avoid a quick shakeout, runs through 210.28.


Caterpillar's consolidation was just a few days short of a proper flat base. However, the 200.27 buy point also applies to the [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) CAT stock produced in January, seen on a weekly chart.


While CAT stock's advance appeared to stall, the drop-off in volume signaled that institutional investors were in no hurry to sell.


Aggressive investors could have opened a position on Feb. 2, as CAT stock bounced back above its 21-day moving average after finding support at the 50-day line. That's when Caterpillar stock was added to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


Caterpillar's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in IBD charts, has recovered back to the two-year high first hit in mid-January.


Caterpillar Earnings
--------------------


[Caterpillar reported a 22% EPS drop in Q4](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-earnings-top-q4-estimates-cat-stock/) to $2.12, as revenue fell 14.5% to $11.235 billion. The Dow Jones stock noted that dealers cut inventories by $1.1 billion in the quarter, worse than the expected decline of $700 million. However, sales still improved from Q3's $9.9 billion, when dealers cut inventories by about $600 million.


Caterpillar didn't offer specific Q1 or 2021 guidance but predicted a seasonal rise in dealer inventories. It also sees a sequential improvement in operating profit margin.


Caterpillar stock, with a 63 [IBD Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-caterpillar-inc-cat.aspx), doesn't meet key criteria for growth stock investors. However, CAT stock can be a big winner early in an economic cycle, after sales have hit bottom, particularly when the upturn is global in scope.


The Composite Rating combines several key fundamental and technical factors into a single score. IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.

**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), holding in a buy zone amid an upbeat outlook on the housing sector. D.R. Horton stock is up 41% so far in 2019.

Analyst Cautious On D.R. Horton Stock
-------------------------------------


CFRA Director of Equity Research Ken Leon is rating D.R. Horton stock as a hold with a 47 target. While he admires the firm, he believes there are other housing stocks with more growth potential.


"While we view positively DHI's market leader position in entry-level and affordable new home communities, we think smaller builders have more sales momentum in signing up millennial homebuyers, he said in a research note. "DHI's ability to realize higher upper-single revenue growth is dependent on short sales cycles to delivery homes, with a higher percentage of speculative built homes."


Housing Market Outlook Positive
-------------------------------


There are a number of factors at play that are giving investors reason to consider housing stocks. Wedbush Securities analysts are "cautiously optimistic" on the U.S. housing market's prospects. This is despite housing affordability challenges, rising student debt and less favorable government mortgage agency credit policies.


"The sharp 130-bps decline in mortgage rates since November and easier comparisons ahead point to an inflection back to positive existing-home sales growth in 2H19, continued modest home price appreciation and accelerating mortgage refinancing demand," they said in an Aug. 15 research note. "Plus the consumer remains very healthy due to solid job growth, 50-year-low unemployment rates and high consumer confidence, providing near-term housing market support."


The China trade war and global growth fears are helping housing by bringing down interest rates. But if the trade war continues to escalate and the U.S. teeters on recession, that would spill over to housing.


In addition, the expiration of the Qualified Mortgage patch in 2021 is likely to restrict credit availability to marginal homebuyers.

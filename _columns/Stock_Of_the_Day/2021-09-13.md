**Energy Select Sector SPDR** ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, as oil stocks are outperforming the market amid growing expectations that oil prices will continue to rise. XLE stock is in buy range.




XLE tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. energy companies in the S&P 500.


The exchange-traded fund includes Big Oil's most recognized names, such as **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)). Some of the ETF's top market movers today also include **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) and **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)). **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) also makes the list.


U.S. crude oil prices rose 1% to settle at $70.45 a barrel on Monday as a new tropical storm threatened to disrupt Gulf of Mexico operations, just a few weeks after Hurricane Ida blew through the key oil region.


Meanwhile, OPEC also raised its demand forecast for 2022, when it sees output surpassing pre-pandemic levels.


"This comes despite demand challenges in the coming months as a result of the delta variant, which OPEC alluded to in its monthly report." said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note Monday. "Despite this, demand remains strong supported by output disruptions elsewhere."


Elsewhere, Bank of America Global Research said a cold winter could spur more demand for oil, so it's mulling bringing forward its $100 per barrel oil price target to the next six months from mid-2022.

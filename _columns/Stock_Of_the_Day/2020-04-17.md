Cybersecurity provider **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Fortinet stock moved just above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), even as the coronavirus pandemic upends other industries. Cybersecurity peers **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) have already cleared buy points in recent days.




Qualys stock and Zscaler stock are recent Stock Of The Day picks.


The gains for those companies come as analysts weigh greater demand for computer security, as more people work remotely, against the prospect of a steep recession in which large customers could cut back on their technology spending.


Fortinet Stock
--------------


Shares climbed 2.5% to 112.96 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). That cleared a 112.95 buy point for Fortinet from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). However, volume was far below average in the FTNT stock breakout. Ideally, investors should look for breakouts on volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal to signal institutional buying.


Fortinet stock began forming that base on Feb. 7, [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) shows. As with the broader stock market, shares caved in the weeks that followed, as fears over the pandemic's potential impact on the economy and daily life sank in with investors. Fortinet stock appeared to find a floor in mid-March, and rebounded after that.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member has a best-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a measure of a company's ability to accelerate earnings, also stands at 99. IBD typically advises investors to keep an eye on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) of Fortinet stock soon surged into new high ground, but has pulled back somewhat as it formed its handle. The RS line, the blue line in the chart above, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Fortinet draws most of its sales from its FortiGate network security products. The company also provides broader infrastructure and cloud security services, and security for the Internet of Things. Investors will likely get more clarity on how the pandemic is affecting demand when Fortinet reports earnings on May 6.


Other Cybersecurity Stocks
--------------------------


Other cybersecurity stocks have broken out recently or are still hovering in buy range.


Qualys stock broke out from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) last week. But Qualys stock is now extended from the 94.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares climbed 0.3% to 106.13 on Friday. The IBD Composite Rating and EPS Rating are both a stellar 98 out of 99.


As with Fortinet stock, Qualys stock is a member of the IBD 50.


Meanwhile, Zscaler stock fell 3.4% to 68, back in the 5% chase zone from a 66.60 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Zscaler stock broke out on Wednesday.


Okta stock rose 0.45% to 148.09. Okta stock remains in buy range from a 143.08 entry.


**Ping Identity** ([PING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PING)), a late 2019 IPO stock, rose 0.8% to 25.18. PING stock is working on a 29.90 entry from a very deep V-shaped base.


The Computer-Software Security group is ranked a lofty 17 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.

Cybersecurity Stock Benefits, Pitfalls
--------------------------------------


In an effort to contain the coronavirus's spread, many U.S. states have asked people to stay indoors and work remotely. But more people logging on to their employers' networks means greater need for security. That trend could send Fortinet stock and other cybersecurity stocks higher.


"Specific to cybersecurity, we believe corporations are facing challenges in terms of VPN capacity, protecting workers adequately with next-generation network and endpoint security offerings, intensifying email and phishing campaigns, identity access management, and control over software applications," William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research note, [as a recent IBD story noted](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/).


However, that story said, Cowen analyst Nick Yako warned that airlines, hotels, restaurants and other industries hard hit by the pandemic might spend less on cybersecurity this year.

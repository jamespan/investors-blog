But in the latter six months, profitability recovered in a big way. The recovery came from price hikes to offset higher raw material costs, as well as product launches and cost controls, CEO Mikael Bratt said in the Q4 earnings release.


In 2023, analysts polled by FactSet expect a 49% Autoliv EPS rebound on 13.5% revenue growth. It's expected to grow earnings a further 42% in 2024.


The company itself has predicted 15% organic sales growth and margin improvement this year.


Autoliv Stock: Hitched To EV Boom
---------------------------------


Sweden's Autoliv is an emerging electric vehicle (EV) play. It touts high EV order win rates in 2022, from EV startups as well as established automakers shifting to battery-powered vehicles.


It supplies things like "low noise seat belts" for EVs.


In October 2022, Autoliv and China car giant Geely agreed to jointly develop advanced safety technology for future vehicles.


Geely owns Sweden's Volvo Cars, and the pair cofounded **Polestar** ([PSNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSNY)), an EV startup. The latest Chinese media reports suggest Geely will be launching its own EV brand, called Galaxy.

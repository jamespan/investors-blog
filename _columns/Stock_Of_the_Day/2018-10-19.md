**Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)), the health insurer whose stock skidded 26% after announcing a $67 billion deal to buy **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)) in February, is no longer the skunk at a garden party. Cigna stock, back near a buy point, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




For months, Cigna stock was shunned while the rest of its Medical-Managed Care industry were stock market darlings. The group, which is currently ranked No. 5 of 197 [IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-18-2018/) based on stock performance, has been a fixture in the top 20 industry groups.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), a member of the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)Â and Dow Jones stock, hit a new record earlier this week on [stellar Q3 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/unitedhealth-earnings-report-unitedhealth-stock/). **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), a Medicaid managed care provider that has turned the ObamaCare exchanges into a cash cow, is ranked No. 1 in the industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene stock is just below its own buy point with its own earnings due Tuesday. Other health insurers also are doing well.


Now it looks as though Cigna, which will report third-quarter earnings Nov. 1, could be joining the cream of the crop. Cigna stock slipped 1.3% to 210 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), but shares have rebounded to just below a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point of 216.10. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is just below its late January peak.

Stock Of The Day Boasts Strong Fundamentals
-------------------------------------------


Cigna boasts a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of a best-possible 99. Earnings growth has been strong, with 48% and 34% gains in the last two quarters. Sales growth has slowly accelerated for the past three quarters, to 10% in the latest period.


Cigna Express Scripts Deal Debated
----------------------------------


While shares of competitors streaked higher over the summer, activist investor Carl Icahn briefly tried to blow apart the Cigna-Express Scripts deal. Cigna pushed back against the doubts, winning the approval of shareholders and, more recently, regulators. The deal is expected to close soon.


Cigna Express Scripts Merger Follows Industry Trend
---------------------------------------------------


Doubts about the Cigna-Express Scripts merger are focused on the staying power of Express Scripts, a giant in the prescription benefit management industry. The success of UnitedHealth with its OptumRx PBM and the nearly complete merger between **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)) and **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)), with its Caremark PBM unit, show that the trend is for major insurers to bring prescription benefit management in house. **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)), which had a public fight with Express Scripts, is forming its own PBM as well.


Cigna has touted the Express Scripts deal as a key to containing prescription costs, and management hopes that Express Scripts will open doors to Cigna for cross-selling. Potential competition from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), after its entry into the retail prescription business, is also a fear. The big question is the extent to which Express Scripts could see its PBM business shrink.


For now, though, Cigna's strong performance and reputation as a leader in restraining medical cost growth, has quieted doubts.

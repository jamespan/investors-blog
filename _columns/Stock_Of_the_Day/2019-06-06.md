Chipmaker **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after it reached a technical buy point following an upgrade from a Wall Street analyst. AMD stock surged on the news.




Over the past eight weeks, AMD stock had formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of 30.05, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) chart analysis. AMD stock cleared the buy point by jumping 7.9% to close at 31.82 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). In intraday trading, it rose as much as 8.4% to 31.98. Volume was tracking more than double its average, a good sign.


Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded AMD stock to equal weight from underweight and raised his price target to 28 from 17.


"The table is set well for 2020 and there are positive near-term catalysts," he said in a note to clients. "Being cautious on the stock has obviously been the wrong call."

Still Reason For Caution, Morgan Stanley Says
---------------------------------------------


However, Moore still thinks there is "too much short-term optimism" in the stock and forecasts for the second-half of the year appear too high.


While AMD shares cleared a proper buy point, the market remains in correction mode. That means breakouts are more likely to fail. Read the latest [Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) article for more details on the market's current direction.


Also, the chip sector is in the throes of a down cycle and a predicted recovery in the second half of 2019 is looking more suspect.


In the [first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q1-2019-amd-stock/), AMD's earnings per share fell 45% year over year while sales declined 23%. AMD's results marked its first year-over-year decline in sales in 12 quarters. And it was the chipmaker's first year-over-year decline in earnings since it last reported a loss, in the second quarter of 2017.


AMD Stock Ranks No. 9 In Fabless Chip Group
-------------------------------------------


AMD stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97 that has been rising lately, a bullish sign. A Relative Strength Rating of 97 means it has outperformed 97% of stocks on the market.


But AMD ranks No. 9 out of 32 stocks in [IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx) industry group. It has a decent IBD Composite Rating of 78. However, stocks with higher ratings in the group include **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


Investors should focus on companies with [superior earnings and strong stock performance](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), such as those on the prestigious [IBD 50 list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full).


E3 News Could Provide Catalyst For AMD Stock
--------------------------------------------


AMD could get a lift from the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles next week, Moore said.


"We expect AMD to announce a partnership with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) at E3 next week for cloud gaming," he said. In March, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google announced that it is using custom AMD graphics processors for its Stadia cloud gaming project.


Samsung, Supercomputer Deals Boost Shares
-----------------------------------------


AMD stock has been buoyed lately by major project wins.


On [Monday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-jumps-samsung-mobile-graphics-chip-deal/), AMD announced a multiyear partnership to supply mobile graphics chip technology to Samsung Electronics. Under the deal, Samsung will license AMD graphics technology for use in its smartphones and other mobile devices. It will pay AMD licensing fees and royalties.


On [May 7](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2019-05-07-amd-epyc-cpus-radeon-instinct-gpus-and-rocm-open-source-software-to-power), AMD announced that it is working with the U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and **Cray** ([CRAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRAY)) on the world's fastest exascale-class supercomputer. Exascale computing refers to systems capable of at least one exaflop, or a quintillion, calculations per second. A quintillion is a billion billions.


The supercomputer, dubbed Frontier, will have more than 1.5 exaflops of processing power. AMD and its partners expect to deliver the supercomputer to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2021. It will use custom AMD Epyc CPUs and Radeon GPUs.


AMD Making Market Share Gains In PCs, Servers
---------------------------------------------


Advanced Micro Devices has been taking market share recently from **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) in processors for personal computers and servers.


Tier-one computer makers say their use of AMD processors in PCs and servers will grow in the next year, Moore said.


AMD's Epyc processors have emerged as a "worthy challenger" to Intel's server chips, Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said in a May 31 report.


"AMD's Epyc 2 chips will ramp in the third quarter, and we think the firm will approach 10% server CPU (central processing unit) unit share by the end of the year," Davuluri said. "Beyond 2019, we expect more modest share gains for AMD, as we think intensified competition will bring out the best in Intel."


AMD could reach 16% unit market share in server processors in 2023, he said.

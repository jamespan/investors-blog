ServiceNow stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of enterprise software rebounds off a 10-week moving average. ServiceNow earnings are due out in late April with profit expected to fall 4%. It may be a good time to add to an existing position, but starting a new one could be dicey.




ServiceNow stock, like many enterprise software stocks, has had a good run. Shares in **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) broke out of a first-stage, cup-with-handle base Jan. 30 and have shot up more than 26% since then. The IBD Computer-Software Enterprise group ranks [No. 3 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-09-2019/).


Shares in ServiceNow jumped 13% on Jan. 31 after fourth-quarter earnings and subscription billings topped views. ServiceNow is extended from a regular entry point and the gap-up open price of 211.36 on Jan. 30. But the stock has found support just above its 10-week moving average, which is similar to a 50-day line.


ServiceNow earnings are due on April 24. Analysts estimate that profit will slip to 54 cents a share from 56 cents a year earlier.


The ServiceNow earnings guidance may be conservative due to investments in new growth initiatives, some analysts say. In March, ServiceNow rolled out new mobile apps for customers, for example. In addition, new hiring may have been seasonally up in the March quarter.

ServiceNow's first-quarter revenue is expected to grow 30% to $766.2 million. It recorded sales growth of 30%, 37% and 41% in the three previous quarters. The company has set a goal of hitting $4 billion in revenue in 2020.


ServiceNow Stock And 10-Week Moving Average
-------------------------------------------


Santa Clara, Calif.-based ServiceNow makes information-technology service management software, also known as ITSM. Its self-service tech portal enables company employees to access administrative and workflow tools.


ServiceNow has expanded from its core business into software for human resources, customer service management and security.


From a technical perspective, the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) is one trend to watch following the stock's breakout on Jan. 30.


The 10-week moving average graphs the average closing price over the 10 most recent trading weeks. If the stock pulls back a bit forming a new base, look for a rebound in heavy or increasing volume. That might merit adding to a position, if there's a sufficient profit cushion ahead of the ServiceNow earnings report.


ServiceNow Partners With Adobe
------------------------------


ServiceNow competes in some areas with **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)). In March, ServiceNow announced an alliance with **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), a rival of Salesforce.com.


The partnership aims to stitch together Adobe's customer experience data with ServiceNow's customer support data in real time. Adobe is a leader in digital marketing services.


Some analysts are looking ahead to ServiceNow's Knowledge 2019 user conference in early May. The event coincides with an analyst day slated for May 6.


"We look forward to the announcement of ServiceNow's Financial Ops Management solution at Knowledge19," RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said in a note to clients. "We believe the product will initially focus on improving the financial close process through automation and likely expand from there. The opportunity could be significant and potentially larger than core ITSM."


ServiceNow stock rose 2.1% to close at 243.66 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?)

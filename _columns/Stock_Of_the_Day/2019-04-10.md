**Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)), one of several top stocks in the media sector, was Monday'sÂ [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). On Wednesday, Gray Television stock broke out powerfully from an early-stage base. That's after Gray Television stock more than doubled from June to its March 1 peak.




At the start of the year, Gray Television closed its $3.6 billion acquisition of Raycom Media. The combined company owns stations and digital properties in 91 TV markets, primarily in the Midwest and southeastern U.S., including 150 affiliates of Fox, CBS, NBC and ABC. It was a transformative deal for Gray, which went from a regional broadcaster to a leading media company with nationwide scale.


The company on Monday said a new weekend political show hosted by TV news veteran Greta Van Susteren, Gray's chief political analyst, will debut in September.


Top Stocks Have Top Fundamentals
--------------------------------


Gray's earnings and sales growth has been strong in recent quarters. In its latest reported quarter, earnings surged 165% vs. a year earlier. Revenue jumped 40% from a year ago to $328.2 million, the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Q1 results are due in early May.

CLOSE




In 2018, annual pretax margin hit a multiyear high of 27.3%. Annual return on equity was also very respectable at 19.9%.


Acquisition costs are expected to weigh on full-year Gray Television earnings this year, but [earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/) is expected to soar 147% in 2020.


Gray Television Stock Part Of A Bright Market Area
--------------------------------------------------


Gray Television stock boasts a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. So do Sinclair Broadcast stock and Nexstar Media stock, which are also in the Media-Radio/TV group. The radio/TV group is rated No. 16 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.


The media sector has had a leadership position in the stock market for a while now. Local TV station consolidation has been heavy, and not just by Gray Television. Last year, **Sinclair Broadcast Group** ([SBGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBGI)) tried to buy **Tribune Media** ([TRCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRCO)) for $3.9 billion, but Tribune terminated the deal when the FCC voted to send the deal to an administrative court for review. **Nexstar Media** ([NXST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXST)) swooped in to buy Tribune Media instead.



Headed into Wednesday, the media sector placed 9th out of [33 sectors ranked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-05-2019/) based on a combination of fundamental and technical factors.

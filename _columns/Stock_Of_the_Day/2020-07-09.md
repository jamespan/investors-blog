**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) is the IBD Stock of the Day, as shares clear another buy point just days after a breakout from an earlier entry. Costco stock is also hitting a new high Thursday after the membership wholesale/retailer a day earlier reported strong June sales.




Overall, Costco's same-store sales jumped 11.5% last month, above the 7.5% forecast by Consensus Metrix. Same-store sales in the U.S. climbed 11%, beating estimates for a 7.6% gain. Those sales were up 8.4% in Canada and 18% in other international locations, also topping forecasts.


Costco e-commerce same-store sales spiked 85.8%.


During a brief call to discuss the results, the company said that sales in food and sundries came with gains in the positive high teens, lifted by demand for frozen food, liquor and deli items. Fresh food sales were also up.


Earlier this year, customers rushed Costco outlets nationwide as they stocked up on goods to weather the coronavirus pandemic, briefly sending Costco stock higher. But the crisis continued to hamper sales elsewhere last month. Costco's food court service has been limited to carryout only. Gasoline sales have also been weaker, as people stay home more and drive less.


The chain's travel business, which connects members to vacation, hotel and flight packages, also took a hit, as the pandemic limits tourism options.


Other big grocery chains have seen a jump in digital sales. For **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), [digital sales leapt 92% in the first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/kroger-earnings-q120-kroger-stock/). **Walmart**'s ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) [U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 74%](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q1-2020-walmart-stock/) in its first quarter.

Costco Stock
------------


Shares rallied 2.9% to close at a new high of 325.54 on the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), just above a conventional buy point of 325.36. Earlier this week, Costco stock cleared a handle entry of 315.45 while continuing to bounce off support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Shares remain in buy range from that entry, which extends to an upper limit of 331.22.


The stock has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 84, of a best-possible 99, and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 88.


Since the pandemic took hold, Costco's stock performance has been uneven. The stock largely moved sideways from April through late June, as investors processed higher coronavirus-related costs and [fiscal third-quarter earnings that missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-earnings-q3-2020-costco-stock-buy-point/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) of Costco stock sagged from April through June, meaning it underperformed the S&P 500, but it has trended higher so far this month.


Among rival stocks, Sam's Club parent Walmart rose 2.7%, and **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) rose 2.8% to 38.73, clearing its own buy point of 38.45.

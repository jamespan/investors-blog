Fortinet is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm gains share in the corporate market even as spending slows on network firewalls. On Monday, Fortinet stock topped an advanced buy point near 141 from a mini-trend line. Shares also are rallying after last week's bounce off the 10-week moving average line, offering a recent secondary entry near 129.




Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Fortinet has seen its stock jump 34% in 2020 despite the slowdown in firewall product growth. While telecom companies still account for roughly one-third of revenue, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) continues to add corporate and medium-size business accounts, analysts say.


Firewall appliances protect computer networks by blocking online intrusions and monitoring web-based apps. In that market, Fortinet competes against **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and others. As large companies shift to off-premise cloud computing services, analysts expect firewall technology to play a lesser role.


On May 7, Fortinet stock popped on better-than-expected first-quarter earnings amid the coronavirus lockdown and shift to remote work.

SD-WAN A Growth Driver
----------------------


Many companies have increased use of virtual private networks as more employees work from home. VPNs enable employees to remotely access internal computer systems. Fortinet sells computer security gear that protects VPNs from hackers.


Aside from the near-term boost related to remote work, Fortinet has developed products that plug in to software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs, an emerging computer infrastructure.


SD-WAN technology taps bandwidth on the public internet. With SD-WAN, companies have less need for costly private data networks leased from telecom companies.


"The company grew SD-WAN revenue by 3.7 times year-over-year through first quarter 2020 and grew SD-WAN billings by 3.4 times year-over-year through second quarter 2020, with revenue reaching the high single-digit percentage contribution to total revenue in the March quarter," William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a recent report.


Overall, first-quarter earnings rose 30% to 60 cents a share while revenue jumped 22% to $576.9 million.


Following the Q1 beat, Fortinet stock pulled back in a normal pattern to its 10-week moving average. A rebound off that key level last week put Fortinet stock within a new buy area, which started around 129.



Fortinet Stock: Potential Entry Points
--------------------------------------


From another technical view, Fortinet has carved out a breaking sloping trend line from its May 20 high that produces an advanced buy point near 141. Buy points from such mini-trend lines are discussed frequently on [IBD Live](https://www.investors.com/ibdlive).


In addition, Fortinet stock is working on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) with a couple of potential entry points at 146.73 or 149.79. The 146.73 entry would be based on a short [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) chart pattern. The 149.79 entry would be 10 cents above its all-time high on May 20.


Please see this [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) on how to time buy points during [rebounds off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Also, Fortinet stock has a [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92 out of a possible 99.


Much of Fortinet's recent growth is tied to semiconductor technology built into its network appliances, analysts say.


"Fortinet's custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) approach remains the key differentiator and enables the company to converge more functions, like SD-WAN, onto the firewall without inhibiting performance," said a Bank of America report in early June.


"Fortinet is leveraging its wide array of functionality, low price point, and Fabric management system to target enterprises looking to consolidate vendors. Enterprise continues to be the main growth driver for Fortinet near term."

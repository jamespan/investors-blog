Gas equipment maker **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) is in a three-weeks-tight formation, creating a follow-on buy point after a breakout and strong earnings last month. That makes Chart Industries stock the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




The Ball Ground, Ga.-based company makes equipment for the production and storage of liquefied natural gas and industrial gases. Chart Industries has customers on six continents ranging from LNG energy companies to those in the biotech field.


Chart Industries Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------------------


Chart Industries stock cleared an 80.41 consolidation buy point on Feb. 12 in strong volume. Shares extended their gains two days later on strong Chart Industries earnings.


Since then, Chart Industries stock has traded tightly, modestly extended from the 80.41 buy point and forming a [three-weeks tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern. This pattern is formed when a stock closes within 1% to 1.5% of the prior week's close for two straight weeks. The stock can be volatile during the week as long as it closes in the allotted range. Investors should look at weekly charts to spot this pattern. Investors shouldn't worry about low-volume trades during this time as it shows that institutional investors are comfortable with the stock's performance.

CLOSE




The buy point is 10 cents above the highest price in the pattern, and that's not always the left side of the consolidation. In the case of Chart Industries stock, it's on the right side of a three-weeks-tight, with shares hitting a new high of 89.80 on Friday. That makes the entry point 89.90.


It's important to buy as close to the buy point as possible with a three-weeks-tight pattern.


Typically, the three-weeks tight pattern is for existing holders to buy more shares. But Chart Industries stock only recently broke out and is not that extended. So new investors can play this particular entry.


However, Chart Industries shares fell 1.8% to 87.40 in Monday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-prices-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/).



**Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) and **Mercury** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) are all forming [three-weeks tight bases](https://www.investors.com/research/current-stock-market-rally-paycom-transdigm-stock-three-weeks-tight-buy-points/).


Chart Industries Stock Is No. 1 In Its Group
--------------------------------------------


Chart Industries stock is the highest-ranked company in IBD's Oil & Gas-Machinery/Equipment group. It has an OK 84 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), but a lackluster 60 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), meaning it is only outperforming 60% of stocks in terms of earnings. That reflects the up-and-down earnings trend for the energy sector, with fossil-fuel prices waxing and waning.


Other members of the Oil & Gas-Machinery/Equipment group include **Archrock** ([AROC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AROC)) and **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)).


Archrock stock sank 2.3%. Cactus stock fell 0.2%.


Chart Industries Earnings
-------------------------


In the latest quarter, Chart Industries earnings were 61 cents per share, up 27% vs. a year earlier. Analysts expected Chart Industries earnings of 54 cents. Revenue rose just 8% to $290.1 million, with growth decelerating as comparisons get tougher. But that still beat views.


Chart Industries now sees 2019 EPS of $2.50-2.85, up from a prior outlook of $2.40-$2.75. Analysts expect $2.75. Chart Industries raised its full-year earnings to $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion, up from an earlier outlook of $1.24 billion to $1.30 billion. Analysts expect $1.29 billion.

**Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the fast-growing cybersecurity company hovers near a buy point. Zscaler stock trades near a record high.




As many employees continue to work from home during the pandemic, there is more demand for secure networks, like virtual private networks. Zscaler is the biggest provider of cloud-based web security gateways that inspect customers' data traffic for malware. It provides cloud-based cybersecurity services via 150 data centers worldwide.


Zscaler is rebounding from a key support level, for the first time since an April 15 breakout in the current stock market rally. A continued rebound off a pullback would result in a new buy zone.


Zscaler stock has tested the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and rebounded somewhat.

**The Carlyle Group** ([CG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CG)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the private equity firm eyes a buy point a day after **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) broke out. CG stock cleared its own buy point intraday Friday, but pulled back.




Carlyle Group's revenue streams include fund management fees, incentive fees and investment income.


Carlyle holds the No. 6 rank in IBD'S finance/investment management industry group, trailing **Apollo Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) and KKR. CG stock is also among [the low P-E stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-apple-tv-stock-market-rally-ally-roku-zscaler-rh/) acting well in the current market. It has a P-E ratio of 11, trading at 0.6 times the S&P 500 as a whole. KKR also has a P-E ratio of 11.


Normally, IBD tells investors to ignore price-to-earnings ratios as largely irrelevant for winning stocks. But recent stock market moves signaled that high valuations are out of favor, while value or cheap is in.

CG Stock: Technical Analysis
----------------------------


CG stock closed up 0.6% at 25.79 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), just below a 26.09 buy point off a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), on weak volume. KKR stock edged up 0.3% to 28.13 after topping a 27.87 buy point Thursday.


Carlyle stock is up 17% from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) breakout earlier this year. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a 52-week high as CG stock tried to break out, a bullish sign. The RS line, tracking a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is shown in blue in the chart below.


Much of the current consolidation has happened below the 10-week moving average, which bears watching. Volume has also been lighter in up weeks than in down weeks over this period. Top stocks reverse that, with volume rising in up weeks.


A Composite Rating of 93 means Carlyle Group is in the top 7% of all stocks in terms of relative share price performance over the last year. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ indicates buying has been moderate of late.


Institutional backing is on the lighter side. The number of funds owning Carlyle stock stood at 79 in June, down from 84 a year ago.



CG Earnings Growth
------------------


A cup-shaped base often forms as positive news causes a stock to rally, fueling a rise to new highs without a pause or pullback.


In the case of Carlyle Group stock, the news has been good earnings — and more. In July, the private equity firm posted a 120% jump in diluted EPS to $1.23 as revenue grew 19% to $1.061 billion. Assets under management reached $222.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago.


Carlyle Group has an EPS Rating of 77. Analysts expect Carlyle EPS to vault 102% to $1.66 in fiscal 2019, then to climb 50% to $2.49 in 2020. That's based in part on easier year-over-year comparisons, after EPS fell in 2018.


The company also announced plans to convert from a publicly traded partnership to a full C-corp, which should make CG stock more liquid and attractive to investors through potential inclusion into indices and benchmarks.


But Carlyle's single-digit annual sales growth, debt-to-equity ratio, and margins bear watching, the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-copart-inc-cprt.aspx) tool shows.

**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as financial stocks hold up relatively well amid a recent uptrend in Treasury yields. AXP stock is near a buy point, but investors need to be cautious about adding exposure amid a market correction.




American Express' [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is at highs. The RS line compares a stock's performance to that of the S&P 500. When the RS line is climbing, this means it is outperforming the benchmark index.


The RS line is a helpful tool for finding leading and lagging stocks in any type of market. An RS line hitting record highs before the stock is especially bullish.


Financial stocks have been doing well in the past few weeks as the 10-year Treasury yield trends higher amid concerns about inflation and a government default. But Treasury yields have faced some resistance over the last few days after hitting a three-month high.


American Express has over 112 million cards in use worldwide ranging from its American Express Blue Cash card to its Gold and Platinum cards that offer high-end travel perks.


While smaller than rivals **Visa** andÂ **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), AXP stock has some big-time investors.


**Berkshire Hathaway**'s ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) [Warren Buffett](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks/) has a major stake in American Express.

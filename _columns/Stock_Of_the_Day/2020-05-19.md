SIMO Stock Leads Low-Ranked Industry Group
------------------------------------------


Silicon Motion ranks first out of nine stocks in IBD's Computer-Data Storage industry group. It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-silicon-motion-tech-ads-simo.aspx). The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


However, the data storage group ranks a mediocre No. 117 out of [197 industry groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), with No. 1 the top-ranked group. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.


Silicon Motion is the global leader in supplying Nand flash controllers for solid-state storage drives. Its controllers are used in PCs, smartphones, servers and other devices.



Silicon Motion Posts Beat-And-Raise Quarterly Report
----------------------------------------------------


On April 28, Silicon Motion posted a beat-and-raise first-quarter earnings report. It earned an adjusted 80 cents a share on sales of $132.8 million. Wall Street predicted earnings of 67 cents a share on sales of $131.1 million in the March quarter.


On a year-over-year basis, Silicon Motion earnings jumped 90% while sales popped 40%. It was the company's fastest earnings growth in five years and best sales growth in over three years.


For the second quarter, Silicon Motion guided to sales of $138 million, based on the midpoint of its outlook. Analysts were looking for $132.4 million.


Company Pulled Full-Year Guidance
---------------------------------


Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill on Tuesday reiterated his buy rating on SIMO stock with a price target of 62.


Growth in the company's PC and enterprise systems businesses should offset any expected weakness in handset unit sales this year, he said in a note to clients. The company withdrew its 2020 guidance because of lack of visibility into the second half of the year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.


Silicon Motion ranks No. 27 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks.

**Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after moving into a buy zone Thursday following weeks of tight trading. Anthem is one of several top-rated health insurers, including **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **WellCare Group** ([WCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCG)).




As IBD founder William J. O'Neil mused, constructive patterns often have periods of [tight trading](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tight-action-reveals-accumulation/). Anthem stock traded tightly for three weeks and then moved to a new high Thurday. Anthem stock cleared a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) buy point of 268.23, rising 1.1% to 270.89 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Usually, a three-weeks-tight pattern breakout is an opportunity for existing holders to add a few more shares to their position. But this tight pattern is just above a [26-week saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) base, so new investors also can treat the 268.23 buy point as actionable.


Volume was well above average, a bullish sign.



Anthem's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, also hitting a new high Thursday. It's bullish when the RS line moves with or ahead of a stock into high ground.


Anthem stock has solid fundamentals, which is reflected in its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 89. In addition the stock has a strong [RS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength3) of 86. [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) aficionados know that the I of the acronym stands for Institutions. Anthem stock boasts a A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-tools/accumulationslhdistribution-(accslhdistm)-rating), reflecting above-average buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

Stock Of The Day Is In Leading Industry Group
---------------------------------------------


Another positive is that Anthem is in a strong industry group. The Medical-Managed Care group is now rated No. 13 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks, steadily climbing in the rankings in recent weeks. Investors should focus on top stocks in leading groups. **WellCare Group** and **Molina Health** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) hit record highs Thursday, with UnitedHealth, **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) and **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) all hitting all-time bests in the past week. All five of those health insurers have Composite Ratings of at least 90, with Centene  stock at a best-possible 99.


Anthem Stock Wins Upgrade
-------------------------


On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley upgraded Anthem stock to overweight, raising the price target to 368 from 273. Analyst Zack Sopcak believes Anthem will benefit from moving its pharmacy benefits management in-house as the space is hit with mergers and regulated pricing reform.


The Justice Department reportedly is close to approving the **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) $52 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)) as well as the **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) buy of insurer **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)). CVS Health is a drug store and PBM giant. UnitedHealth has its own PBM.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is buying PillPack, an online pharmacy.

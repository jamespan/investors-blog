Tempur Sealy International ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the mattress company expands domestic production to reduce exposure to supply-chain bottlenecks. TPX stock retreated is near buy points.




Tempur Sealy CEO Scott Thompson said on the third-quarter earnings call that the company is expanding its U.S. manufacturing capacity to combat supply-chain constraints and increased backlogs.Â 


"The supply-chain constraints once again forced us to turn away business this quarter," Thompson said. "We estimate that it was about $100 million. Considering this and the unrealized sales from our increased backlog, our sales could have been higher by over $200 million this period."


Over the last 12 months, Tempur Sealy opened three new manufacturing facilities. Additionally, it recently broke ground on its third domestic foam-pouring plant in Indiana, which should activate in 2023.

Tempur Sealy Earnings
---------------------


Tempur Sealy reported earnings of 88 cents a share in Q3, a 19% increase from the year-ago period. Sales grew 20% year over year to $1.36 billion.


The Lexington, Ky.-based manufacturer and retailer raised its financial guidance for the full year. It currently expects net sales growth to exceed 35% vs. 2020, and full-year adjusted EPS between $3.20 and $3.30.


TPX Stock
---------


Shares sank 2.1% to 44.78 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). TPX stock has an official 48.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/), according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Shares broke a trendline and regained their 50-day moving average recently, offering an entry point for a small position. But Tempur Sealy stock fell back below those key levels Thursday. Investors could start a position above Tuesday's high of 46.70.


Getting above Tuesday's high might suggest some positive market action. A market rally attempt is underway, but it is not yet confirmed. So investors should be cautious about new buys and ramping up exposure.


Tempur Sealy's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been ticking back up after taking a breather from reaching multiyear highs in October.



Its [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 90 out of a best-possible 99, while its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 91. With a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, TPX stock is ranked first in IBD's household/office furniture group, which itself is ranked much lower at 187 out of 197.


Home furnishings and housing stocks have been performing well amid solid quarterly results recently, indicating likely continued strong demand for Tempur Sealy products.


Late Wednesday, luxury home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) reported quarterly EPS of $7.03, a 13% increase from a year earlier, with sales up 19% to roughly $1 billion. RH stock gapped up at the open but pulled back below its 50-day and 200-day lines, closing up 5.5%.


Homebuilder **Hovnanian** ([HOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOV)) surged 14% today after reporting that earnings rocketed 211% year over year to $6.72 per share. Sales gained 10% to $690.7 million.

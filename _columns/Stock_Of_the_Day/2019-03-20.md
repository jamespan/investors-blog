Online luxury fashion retailer **Farfetch** ([FTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTCH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as big money floods into the recent IPO stock amid rapid sales growth.




The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-farfetch-limited-cl-a-ftch.aspx) shows revenue at the British firm has jumped 64% over the past three years. In addition, earnings surged 83% in the last quarter.


These figures have attracted the attention of institutional investors. In total, 50 funds took new positions in the most recent reporting period, 74 added to existing positions, while only 22 cut. Many are A-rated funds. This activity is crucial for [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) connoisseurs, as the "I" in the acronym standing for Institutional Sponsorship.


A notable investor is T Rowe Price's New Horizons fund, which is rated as one of the best in the industry by IBD founder William J. O'Neil. It boosted its position in the IPO stock from 354,000 shares to 2.34 million in Q4, making its move even as Farfetch stock suffered a battering on the market.

Farfetch Stock Analysis
-----------------------


Shares closed down 0.1% at 26.62 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been on a downward trend after hitting a new high on an earnings gap-up March 1, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). However, it has been holding steady above its 50-day moving average.


Aggressive investors could opt for a 31.70 buy point on its current [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). But both the cup base and handle are deep, so it is very risky. It may be more prudent to wait, as a new base could form as Farfetch stock consolidates.



At the moment the IPO stock may be one to keep on your watch list. Its IBD Composite Rating is a mediocre 57. In addition its EPS Rating of 22 is poor, even as sales grow at a healthy clip. Its Relative Strength Rating of 74 reflects decent stock market performance, however it is still not ideal.


Farfetch followed up an earnings miss by beating views in the most recent quarter, and it has beaten on revenue in both quarters.


Farfetch stock [jumped by double digits when it began trading](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/farfetch-ipo-trades-friday/) on the New York Stock Exchange Sep. 21, with considerable interest from institutional investors. However action has been choppy since then, and it hit a low of 15.98 on Jan. 3.


IPO Stock Not Such A Farfetched Idea
------------------------------------


[Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/) provides an online platform for the global luxury fashion industry, designed to connect consumers and retailers. The platform has three main components: applications, services and data.


The online marketplace has ties to Chinese e-commerce giant **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), which invested $397 million into a partnership luxury retailer in 2017. Earlier this month, Farfetch said its combining its Chinese business with JD.com.


The companies will join their operations under the Farfetch brand, while JD.com will handle logistics. This could be a source of big profits for Farfetch stock, as consultancy Bain estimates Chinese consumers make around about a third of global luxury purchases.

Copart stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), clearing a buy point as the online wrecked-car auctioneer said it's "doubling down" on growth. Late Wednesday, Copart earnings and revenue topped views with another quarter of accelerating growth.




Copart Stock: Technical Analysis
--------------------------------


Shares of **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) rose 6.5% to 80.61 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), above a 79.84 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) buy point. Shares hit 81.43 intraday. Copart stock is up 34% from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) breakout earlier this year.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Copart stock hit a record high Thursday, a bullish signal. The RS line, tracking a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is shown in blue in the chart below.


A flat base has a depth of no more than 15%. The base is particularly bullish in weak or choppy stock markets, such as the current one amid global trade and growth uncertainties. It suggests the stock is holding up relatively well in a market under pressure.


An RS Rating of 91 means Copart stock is outperforming 91% of all stocks in terms of relative share price performance over the last year. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C+ could be better, suggesting that buying and selling have been roughly equal of late.



Copart Earnings Growth Accelerates
----------------------------------


Fiscal fourth-quarter Copart earnings vaulted 43% to 60 cents per share as revenue jumped 21% to $542.6 million. Both beat views. Copart earnings and sales growth has accelerated for the past two quarters.


For fiscal 2019, Copart earnings grew 31% to $2.25 and sales rose 13% to $2 billion. Results were adversely affected by Hurricane Harvey, raising costs for temporary storage facilities, subhaulers and overtime.


"It's damn impressive," CEO Jay Adair said on the Copart earnings call held Thursday. "I've never seen Copart in a better position to seize the future."


Copart earnings rose by an average 27% the past three quarters, in line with the annual average of 29% over the last three years. Those figures are above the 25% gain desired for [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) investing requirements.


Revenue climbed at an 18% annual pace the past three years.


Copart has a superior 96 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), the highest in its industry group. Looking ahead, analysts expect annual earnings-per-share growth to grow 13% in both 2020 and 2021.


The company also looks strong on other fundamental metrics. Copart has a return on equity of 31% and a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio of 25%, the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-copart-inc-cprt.aspx) tool shows.


Copart 'Doubling Down' With Expansion
-------------------------------------


Copart styles itself a digital innovator and technology leader in the auto and retail industries.


Online bidding for autos was a "brand-new concept" when Copart introduced it in 1998, management said. The company pioneered virtual bidding technology and dominates social media, where passionate users "talk about nothing but Copart on their channels," management added.


Copart says it's "doubling down" on storage capacity expansion to meet rising demand from car buyers and sellers. The leader in salvaged vehicle auctions also is adding locations in the U.S. and abroad, as well as making acquisitions.


A tailwind for Copart's growth is increasing total loss frequency. Today, more than one in five cars involved in an accident is totaled. That compares to one in 25 cars four decades ago.


The tech-laden cars of today means they are more likely to be written off as a total loss than repaired.


"We are going to see increased volumes as an industry because the trend that is most important is the technology being put in cars," CEO Adair said Thursday.


Meanwhile, average selling prices on Copart vehicles are also rising, a reflection in part of more international bidders at its online auctions.


No. 1 Stock Among Auto Retail Stocks

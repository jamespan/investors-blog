**Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the music and podcast streaming service pushes through price hikes to improve its profitability. Spotify stock has surged 65% in 2024 amid a fierce rivalry with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).




On the[stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Spotify stock climbed 5.7% to close at 313.62. The company on Monday hiked U.S. subscription prices for its premium services for the second time this year.


Pricing Vs. Apple Music
-----------------------


Starting in July, Spotify Premium members will have to pay a dollar more for their individual subscriptions at $11.99 a month. The individual plan now will be priced $1 above Apple Music, noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report.


For investors in Spotify stock, two questions are whether Spotify will hike prices in more countries and how many subscribers would respond by canceling streaming services.


"If this price increase is carried out more broadly across the world, it could introduce greater churn impact than last July's 50-country price hike," added Mahaney. "That said, this may well be a signal of Spotify's confidence in its value proposition, competitive position, and pricing power, especially as the prior price increases resulted in better-than-expected churn impact."


Spotify stock holds an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) of 319.30 from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


In a bullish sign, SPOT stock broke a downtrend line with Monday's move. Also, Spotify stock bounced off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/) trades near highs.


Spotify Stock: Technical Ratings

Spotify Stock: Profitability Improves
-------------------------------------


Spotify ended 2023 with 602 million users worldwide, including 236 million paying customers. The company offers a free, advertising-supported service in addition to its ad-free subscription service.


Spotify has lost money every year since it went public in 2018. But now, after gaining scale, it is taking steps to reach long-term profitability.


Further, Spotify pays songwriters and publishers royalties.


Analysts polled by FactSet expect Spotify to earn $3.88 a share this year, compared with a loss of $2.93 a share in 2023.

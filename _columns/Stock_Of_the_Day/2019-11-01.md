**Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker rocketed Friday on better-than-expected September-quarter earnings, fueled by its 5G wireless business. Qorvo stock leapt to an 18-year high on the news and staged a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/).




Late Thursday, the Greensboro, N.C.-based company posted results for its [fiscal second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qorvo-stock-q2-2020-qorvo-stock/) ended Sept. 28. It earned an adjusted $1.52 a share on sales of $807 million. Analysts expected Qorvo earnings of $1.30 a share on sales of $754 million. On a year-over-year basis, Qorvo earnings fell 13% while sales dropped 9%. Like other chipmakers, Qorvo is navigating a downturn in chip spending.


For the December quarter, Qorvo expects to earn an adjusted $1.67 a share on sales of $850 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling Qorvo earnings of $1.35 a share on sales of $766 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. In the year-earlier period, Qorvo earned $1.85 a share on sales of $832 million.


Qorvo makes radio-frequency chips for smartphones, communications networks and other applications. The company credited an upswing in smartphone manufacturing and the 5G wireless buildout for its outperformance last quarter.

Qorvo Stock Breaks Out Of 65-Week Consolidation
-----------------------------------------------


Qorvo stock jumped 20.2%  to close at 97.22. It hit a session high of 97.34 in afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The stock also climbed to its highest level on an intraday basis since December 2001.


Under IBD trading rules, the opening price of 91.88 is the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on an [earnings gap up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/). That's the start of the [5% chase zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). In recent trades, Qorvo stock was extended beyond the buy zone.


Qorvo stock is tied with **Diodes** ([DIOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIOD)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) as the top stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. All three have an IBD Composite Rating of 98. That means they have outperformed 98% of stocks in key metrics over the past 10 months.


The chipmaking group ranks a strong No. 19 from the top of IBD's 197 industry groups list, as investors bet on a recovery in the chip sector.


Based on a weekly chart from [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), Qorvo stock broke out of a 65-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) at a buy point of 86.60 on Friday.


Qorvo Stock Snares Price-Target Hikes
-------------------------------------


Qorvo stock received at least 10 price-target hikes from Wall Street analysts on Friday. However, half of those analysts are neutral on the stock.


Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qorvo stock and upped his price target to 92 from 78.


"We believe Qorvo is well positioned to grow content share in both 5G infrastructure and smartphones and are encouraged both businesses are demonstrating strong 5G design activity and sales trends exiting calendar 2019," he said in a report to clients.


Piper Jaffray analyst Harsh Kumar kept his overweight rating and raised his price target to 95 from 85.


"The strength was driven by strong share gains for 5G solutions at Samsung as well as top Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), including Huawei," Kumar said in his note to clients. "The company is seeing the dual effect of 5G share gains as well as the move to more integrated solutions in 5G, particularly in China."


Qorvo Getting Benefits From iPhones
-----------------------------------


Qorvo also benefited from the ramp-up in production of **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) latest iPhones, analysts said.


Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill maintained his buy rating on Qorvo stock and increased his price target to 105 from 90.


"The beat was principally driven by better-than-expected mobile, as demand strengthened throughout the quarter," Gill said in a report. Samsung smartphone business was a "standout" last quarter, he said.

**Viavi Solutions** ([VIAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIAV)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of test and measurement gear starts to step from the shadows from sister company **Lumentum Holdings** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)). With a big pop on Monday, Viavi stock moved into a buy zone.




Ever since [Lumentum was spun off from](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/lumentum-has-momentum-without-finisar-takeover/) former dot-com highflier JDS Uniphase in August 2015, Viavi has been an also-ran. Viavi is the slower-growing test and measurement business left over from the JDS spinoff.


Lumentum has been in the spotlight as a supplier of 3D sensor chips to iPhone maker **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Meanwhile, Viavi's revenue from longtime telecom customers **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) slowed.


More critically, Lumentum stock has tripled in three years while Viavi lagged. Lumentum shares are up around 60 while Viavi has been stuck in high single digits to low teens.

But Viavi's down-on-its-luck days could be over. In August, it delivered in first beat-and-raise quarter in a long time.


Viavi Moves Into Growth Markets
-------------------------------


The reason is the company also has charged into new growth markets such as next generation 5G wireless and anti-counterfeiting technology. The San Jose, Calif-based firm also has moved into the 3D sensor market as a supplier of filters used in smartphones.


An upgrade to buy from Deutsche Bank helped Viavi stock surge 7.3% to close at 12.17 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).


"Viavi is our small-cap idea on a multiyear 5G broadband and fiber (density) buildout cycle," Deutsche Bank analyst Vijay Bhagavath said in a note to clients. He raised its price target to 14 from 10.50.


With Monday's gain, the company popped over a technical buy point of 11.65. Viavi stock has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern. The cup took 16 months to come together, from May 2017 through August 2018.


Seven out of 10 analysts that follow the stock now rate it buy or outperform.


Viavi Acquisition
-----------------


In March, Viavi acquired the test and measurement business of Cobham for $455 million.


The deal made the company a stronger player in 5G test equipment against Anritsu, **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)), and Rhode & Schwartz. Keysight also is near a buy point, currently trading 5% below that at 70.50.


AT&T, Verizon and other wireless firms are in the very early stages of deploying 5G networks. They're expected to provide fixed broadband services to homes and whisk video at faster speeds to smartphones. Other 5G markets could include self-driving cars, drones and augmented reality.


Alex Henderson, analyst at Needham & Co., says Viavi's profits, meanwhile, are getting a boost from products it sells into the anti-counterfeiting market. Viavi makes thread substrates embedded in multicolored currency. While quarterly sales are only in the low-$50 million range, the anti-counterfeiting products are highly profitable, says Henderson.


Growth For Viavi Stock?
-----------------------


With the former Cobham assets, Viavi also targets the defense and aviation instrumentation markets.


Further, analysts expect Viavi's 3D-sensor related, filter component business to ramp up in 2019. Deutsche Bank estimates only $50 million in revenue from the low-margin filter devices in fiscal 2019, the year ending June 30, 2019. Aside from smartphones, the company is eyeing automotive markets.


Still, Viavi continues to get 75% of revenue from its slow-growing test and measurement business. Aside from telecom, the company sells gear to network gear makers like **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and cable TV companies.


Viavi's [fiscal fourth quarter revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/132839763/files/doc_financials/2018/Q4/VIAV-F4Q18-Earnings-Press-Release-PR-Newswire.pdf) for the period ended June 30 rose 33% to $264 million as profit rose 17% to 14 cents. For the current quarter, analysts estimate 37% sales growth to $267.4 million. Analysts project profit of 14 cents, up 27%.

Teradyne stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is holding at a 15-year high. The relative strength line compares a stock's performance to that of the S&P 500. Teradyne has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97.


Despite the [current down cycle in the chip industry](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-companies-semiconductor-industry/), Teradyne has continued to post year-over-year growth in sales and earnings this year. In addition to advanced test systems for semiconductors, wireless devices and other electronics, Teradyne sells industrial automation systems.


Teradyne Delivered Better-Than-Expected Results
-----------------------------------------------



On July 23, Teradyne reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for the [second quarter](http://investors.teradyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/teradyne-reports-second-quarter-2019-results). The North Reading, Mass.-based company earned an adjusted 66 cents a share on sales of $564 million. On a year-over-year basis, earnings rose 12% while sales climbed 7%.


"We exceeded our revenue and profit guidance for the second quarter on stronger-than-expected results in semiconductor test as continued growth in 5G infrastructure, networking and memory test spending more than offset lower demand from automotive and industrial device makers," Teradyne Chief Executive Mark Jagiela said in a news release.


He added, "In industrial automation, our Universal Robots and MiR collaborative robots business grew 20% in the quarter, highlighting their compelling value even in a challenging global industrial investment environment."


For the current quarter, Wall Street expects Teradyne to earn 70 cents a share on sales of $565 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would translate to a drop of 1% in earnings on roughly flat sales.

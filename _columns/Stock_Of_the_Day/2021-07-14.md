**Vale** ([VALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VALE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Brazilian mining company looks to become more "green." Vale stock is nearing another buy point.




As tech breakouts struggle and the Nasdaq looks extended, investors could look toward mining (metal, not crypto) and commodity companies.


Mining companies have relooked at their assets amid rising global pressure from governments and investors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.


Vale has narrowed its focus in recent months. It left its coal business earlier this year as it looks to become carbon-neutral by 2050.


The company is also considering spinning off its base metals business. The divestiture would allow it to focus on iron ore, a key ingredient in steel production.


Meanwhile, Vale will report Q2 results after the markets close on July 28. It will give an update on Q2 production and sales on Monday. Analysts expect earnings to surge to $7.77 per share from 98 cents in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen soaring 121% to $86.3 million.


But investors should be cautious about buying a stock too close to earnings.

-----------------------------


Shares rose 1.2% to 22.66 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Vale stock is rebounding from its key 21-day line, breaking a recent downtrend, and also has found support at its 50-day/10-week line.


Meanwhile, Vale stock is consolidating in a flat base with a 23.28 buy point. Last month, [shares approached a 23.12 entry](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vale-stock-eyes-new-buy-point-amid-exit-from-coal/) but never cleared it.

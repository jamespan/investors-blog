Hot new IPO **iQiyi** ([IQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IQ)), the **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) of China, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The stock has had a huge run in a short span, is flashing some stalling action Tuesday. **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) spinoff **Huya** ([HUYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUYA)) and **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)), two other recent Chinese livestreaming IPOs, also have had big runs. Meanwhile, **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), a China streaming stock veteran, has also been rallying in recent weeks.




IQiyi Stock Action
------------------


The streaming service, still majority owned by **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), is riding the wave of popularity for online movies and live media in China. U.S. investors have showered love on this wave of new and recent streaming companies, with iQiyi stock doubling in value in under three months.


IQiyi made its IPO on March 29 at 18 and bolted to a new high of 35.95 in today's [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). But shares have pulled back to 1-cent gain at 34.52. Rapid trading with no price advance indicates a stalling day. Along with iQiyi stock's huge advance and being well-extended from the 10-day moving average, that action suggests a short-term pullback is likely.



That could give investors a reason to book some profits.

IQiyi's Cautionary Notes
------------------------


While iQiyi is growing fast, it's losing money. Its IPO filing showed 50.8 million subscribers — and losses of $574.4 million in 2017 on $2.67 billion in revenue.


Per-share losses will continue for the foreseeable future, analysts say, narrowing from $7.80 this year and $6.48 in 2019, per Zacks Investment Research.


The stock's fundamentals bear watching. Its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) is a solid 90. But it has a lowly [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 39 out of a best-possible 99.


IQiyi also faces tough competition in China, primarily from **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) Video and the **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA))-owned Youku Tudou, reports say. But in a testament to its growth potential, Netflix struck a licensing deal last year, making some Netflix original shows available on the streaming service.


Netflix also will reportedly acquire Chinese-language content from iQiyi and Youku Tudou.


Chinese IPOs
------------


Huya, which is a video game livestreaming giant, has tripled since its May IPO at 12. Huya stock also is extended from its 10-day line. Huya fell 0.5% to 36.22 after setting a record 37.61 intraday.


Bilibili, a youth-oriented online media platform, has also run in short order after its recent debut at 11.50. The stock hasn't run up quite as fast as iQiyi and Huya and is closer to its fast-rising 10-day line. Bilibili stock climbed 1.3% to 18.66.


Momo blasted out of a long consolidation in late May and has continued to rally. Momo stock advanced 0.2% to 52.98.

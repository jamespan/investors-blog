**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the enterprise software maker trades just below an entry point in the wake of popping on its second-quarter earnings report. ServiceNow stock has gained 14% in 2024, outperforming other big-cap software companies.




On the[stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), ServiceNow stock shed 3.5% to close at 799.06.


Santa Clara, Calif.-based ServiceNow brought in Bill McDermott as its chief executive in late 2019. He was formerly CEO of Germany's **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)). ServiceNow stock has surged over 180% since McDermott took over as CEO, though shares hit a rough patch in 2022.


The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)), an industry index that includes **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and many big-cap software companies, has gained only 4.6% this year.

ServiceNow Stock: Q2 Earnings Beat
----------------------------------


ServiceNow's software tracks and manages services provided by information-technology departments. Also, its self-service tech portal enables company employees to access administrative and workflow tools.


ServiceNow has expanded from its core business into software for human resources, customer service management and security.


From a technical view, ServiceNow stock has forged a consolidation with a 806.52 [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


ServiceNow's Q2 earnings, revenue and current remaining performance obligations, or CRPO, came in [above expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-stock-servicenow-earnings-news-q22024/). CRPO bookings are an aggregate of deferred revenue and order backlog and serve as a sales growth metric.


"Against a backdrop of a wall of investor worry about the state of overall software spending, ServiceNow posted a very solid print," UBS analyst Karl Kierstead said in a report.


COO Resigns
-----------


Also, ServiceNow said its president and chief operating officer, Chirantan "CJ" Desai, has resigned.


Meanwhile, ServiceNow is one of many [AI stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/). Since 2020, McDermott has been acquiring AI startups to build up ServiceNow's platform. However, McDermott hasn't make big software acquisitions as he did at SAP.


[Generative AI technologies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chatgpt-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-in-content-creating-artificial-intelligence-get-ready-for-a-lot-of-disruption/) create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own. Industry-specific versions of generative AI are expected to use company data to train AI models.


For most big application software companies, how to charge for AI-related products has been an issue. ServiceNow bundles AI conversational tools with premium products.


"Gen AI momentum is real and continues to build," Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a report. "Management noted that net-new annual contract value for the Pro Plus edition doubled quarter-over-quarter with Pro Plus delivering 11 deals over $1 million including 2 deals over $5 million."


Most enterprise software makers will not monetize generative AI, or "conversational AI," in a material way until late 2025, some analysts say.

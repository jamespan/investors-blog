**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The software and engineering and IT consulting firm, which has customers in more than 25 countries, is trading right around a buy point. Epam stock also is close to offering a second entry to investors.




Epam stock is trying to reclaim aÂ 125.98 entry in a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) pattern. Epam Systems rose 0.9% to 125.96 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), just below the buy zone.


A second buying opportunity could come after this week. Assuming Epam stock doesn't plunge or skyrocket, it will form yet another [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/), a base-on-base-on-base pattern. That would have a buy point of 131.85.


Epam Stock Fundamentals Strong
------------------------------


Epam's sales growth has trended higher over the past six quarters. Earnings per share growth sped up during the first five of those six quarters, but slowed in the most recently reported one.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has edged lower in recent weeks but is still close to the record high reached on May 11.


On May 10, Epam stock broke out past that 125.98 entry in heavy trading volume, an encouraging sign. A day before that, Epam reported first-quarter earnings and sales that topped analyst estimates. All told, Epam stock rose 11% over May 9-11.


"We continue to gain market share through both our core engineering and digital capabilities, in addition to our investments in emerging technologies and acquisitions," management said in a statement announcing Epam's first-quarter results.


Epam stock tumbled to just below its buy point on May 14. Since then shares have traded above and below the buy zone. Volume during the down days and the overall consolidation has been lower than during stock's breakout. Shares remain above their 50-day and 200-day lines.


Epam boasts a Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99.

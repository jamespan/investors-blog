**Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. Shares of the software maker are rising toward a handle buy point.




Founded in 1990, Atlanta-based Manhattan Associates develops software tools for supply chains, including warehouse management. The stock has gained roughly 40% this year, outpacing a 27% gain for the S&P 500. That's after shares jumped by 77% in 2023, helped by momentum in the company's shift to [subscription-based software sales.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/manh-stock-why-manhattan-associates-is-guarded-on-generative-ai/) 


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Manhattan Associates stock rose 1% to close at 300.67.  Shares are breaking a four-day downtrend to approach a 306.63 handle buy point.


Enterprise technology firms have rallied in recent weeks after strong earnings reports from a list of companies that includes [**Salesforce**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/) ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and [**Snowflake**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-stock-snowflake-earnings-q32024/) ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)).

IGV is ahead 3% so far this month.


Manhattan Associates Stock Bouncing Back
----------------------------------------


Manhattan Associates, meanwhile, is still working back to highs reached in mid-October. The stock tumbled 7% the day after the company reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 22.


Adjusted earnings per share increased 29% year-over-year for the September-ended quarter, while sales rose 12% to $266.7 million. Both top- and bottom-line metrics exceeded consensus expectations, but analysts noted the company's guidance prompted some investor concern.


"We believe guidance is conservative, (the company's) beat and raise dynamics intact and are incrementally confident in sustained strong cloud, earnings and free-cash-flow compounding growth," wrote Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman in an Oct. 22 client note. "Based on the lower revenue outlook for fiscal year 2025 and after-hours action, we expect shares to trade off tomorrow and would recommend buying on weakness."


Tillman rates the stock a buy.


Manhattan Associates' adjusted earnings are projected to grow 23% this year while sales grow 12%, according to FactSet analyst consensus totals. Earnings grew 35% and sales jumped 21% in 2023.


That's a factor to watch for Manhattan Associates. Revenue growth is projected by analysts to slow against tougher comparisons. Analysts project sales of $253.6 million for the company's December-ending fourth quarter. That would represent 6% year-over-year sales growth, after sales rose 12%, 14.8%, 15.2% and 20% in the previous four quarters.


Wall Street Bullish On Manhattan Associates
-------------------------------------------


However, growth remains strong for the cloud subscription business that investors tend to focus on. Cloud subscription revenue is seen rising 25% to $89.5 million in the company's Q4, according to FactSet.


Piper Sandler analyst Quinton Gabrielli initiated coverage of Manhattan Associates with a positive overweight rating last month. He noted that the company is roughly seven years into a shift to the cloud, a process that can occasionally be bumpy for software companies.


"The supply chain space is seeing multiple secular tailwinds accelerating market growth, and Manhattan's expertise in the most complex environments is differentiating," Gabrielli wrote to clients on Nov. 24. "While cloud transitions can be messy, Manhattan is through the 'worst' of the revenue headwinds, creating increased visibility and margin improvement moving forward, while still offering a more than $3 billion migration opportunity."


He set a price target of 326 for Manhattan Associates stock with the report.


Analysts are mostly bullish on the stock. There are 11 analysts following Manhattan Associates, according to FactSet. Nine of those analysts hold a buy or equivalent rating, while the other two hold a neutral rating.

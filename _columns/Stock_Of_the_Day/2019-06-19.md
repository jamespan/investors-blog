Adobe Stock Receives Bunch Of Price-Target Hikes
------------------------------------------------



At least 11 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on Adobe stock after the company's earnings report. Of those, eight rate the stock as buy while three are neutral.


Adobe's guidance for the current quarter was slightly below Wall Street estimates. Several analysts noted that the company has a reputation for being conservative with its outlook.


Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $1.95 a share on sales of $2.8 billion in its fiscal third quarter. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 13% in earnings per share and 22% in sales. Analysts were modeling Adobe earnings of $2.04 a share on sales of $2.82 billion in the current quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said Adobe's second-quarter outperformance was a "return to form" after "two shakier quarters." He rates Adobe stock as overweight with a price target of 340.


Adobe Earnings Report Called 'Boringly Excellent'
-------------------------------------------------


Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis called Adobe's quarterly report "boringly excellent."


"Adobe delivered another classic print and conservative guide from the company that delivers best-in-class margins and 20%-plus revenue growth," he said in a note to clients. Davis reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock and upped his price target to 320 from 300.


Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Creative Cloud features software for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Document Cloud includes its Acrobat and e-signature offerings. Experience Cloud provides marketing software and services.


Software-As-A-Service Leader Digesting Two Acquisitions
-------------------------------------------------------


Adobe has been focused lately on integrating two large acquisitions — Magento and Marketo — into its online marketing services.


Adobe Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said the integration process is going well.


"We had the noise of two big acquisitions back to back and that got the market nervous a little bit," he told Investor's Business Daily. "It's clear now, after having both of these businesses for a while and integrating them and learning how their offerings are resonating with our customers, that it's a winning strategy."


Murphy forecast improving profit margins in the back half of the year.

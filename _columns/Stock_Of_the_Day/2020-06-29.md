**Pacira Biosciences** ([PCRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCRX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the FDA rejected a postoperative pain drug from the biotech company's nearest rival.




Early Monday, **Heron Therapeutics** ([HRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRTX)) said the Food and Drug Administration [declined to approve its drug](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/heron-therapeutics-receives-complete-response-letter-htx-011-0), HTX-011, as a treatment to manage pain following surgery. Analysts saw HTX-011 as the biggest challenger to Pacira's drug Exparel, an injection for the same use.


In response, Pacira [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) surged 18% to close at 52.02 in above-average [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/) on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). That pushed shares of the biotech company to their highest point since November 2018. On the weekly chart, Pacira stock topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 49.46 out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


Heron stock collapsed 28.1% to finish at 14.26.

The FDA cited four issues in its letter, Heron said in a news release. Three relate to confirming exposure of some substances in preclinical testing. The fourth relates to a manufacturing issue. Heron doesn't see any of the issues as unsurmountable.


Still, this gives biotech company Pacira a little breathing room. Exparel is Pacira's bread-and-butter drug. In the first quarter, [Exparel sales](http://investor.pacira.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pacira-biosciences-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results) increased 12% to $101.3 million. Pacira also sells other pain meds. But those sales pale in comparison to Exparel.


Exparel is administered via injection at the surgical site. To date, the pain medicine has been used in more than 6.5 million patients, Pacira says on its website. The biotech company says its drug can control pain for up to 72 hours.


Representatives of the biotech company didn't immediately return a request for comment.


Comparing Exparel And HTX-011
-----------------------------


But Dr. Jason Weisstein, an orthopedic surgeon from Colorado, doubts that 72-hour mark touted by biotech company Pacira. He has regularly used Exparel since 2014. In a recent call with Needham analyst Serge Belanger, Weisstein compared Exparel, Heron's HTX-011 and regular bupivacaine.


Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic. Exparel and HTX-011 both use bupivacaine in their chemical formulations.


Exparel can consistently provide 24-36 hours of pain relief following surgery, Weisstein said, according to Belanger's report. That's an improvement over regular bupivacaine, but doesn't meet the 72-hour mark touted by biotech company Pacira.


Further, the biotech company's Exparel requires 30-80 injections at the end of surgical procedures, Belanger said.


"Dr. Weisstein views HTX-011 as a promising new pain treatment option with a due mechanism of action, consistent clinical data demonstrating pain relief out to 72 hours and a gel-like formulation that should make it easy to use," he said.


Pacira Stock Hits Fresh High
----------------------------


Belanger has a buy rating on Pacira stock.


Shares of the biotech company have a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's technical and fundamental growth metrics. So, Pacira stock ranks in the top 4% of all stocks on this measure.



Importantly, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect the biotech company to show a solid profit this year. On average, they expect adjusted profit of $1.79 per share on $410 million in full-year sales.


Adjusted profit would climb 7.2%. Sales, on the other hand, could slip 2.6%. This sales decline follows a tough year for elective procedures. Doctors use Exparel after procedures like hip and knee replacements. Amid the [coronavirus pandemic,](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) those surgeries have taken a back seat.


"Dr. Weisstein estimates that about 10% of his patients are currently unwilling to have a procedure due to the fear of being infected with Covid-19 and noted that he is not doing procedures on another group that would need to recover in skilled nursing facilities," Belanger said.


Still, Weisstein called for elective procedures to return to 90% of normal by year's end. As a result, analysts expect bullish 30% sales growth for Pacira in 2021. The Street also sees adjusted income growth of 74.3%.

Shares of natural foods grocery-store chain **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) are ripening into buy range, making this produce seller the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




Sprouts Stock Sprouts Into Buy Zone
-----------------------------------


Sprouts stock just poked above a 28.39 entry point in heavier-than-average volume from a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) that started at the end of January. Shares rose 3.9% to 28.52 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It is now trading at levels not seen since the spring of 2016. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is almost at the consolidation high.


Sprouts Farmers Market's most recent earnings report helped shares build the right side of its base. Sprouts stock is now looking to close out the sixth consecutive week of share gains, a bullish trend. However, given its relatively rapid run-up from consolidation lows, it would not be surprising to see Sprouts stock pull back somewhat below the buy point.



Sprouts Stock Fundamentals
--------------------------


Sprouts earnings rose 10% vs. a year earlier in the latest quarter, the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth but a big deceleration from the prior quarter's 53% gain. Sales growth has also been double digit in the past six quarters, though the most-recent 12% gain was the weakest in that run.


But double-digit growth in the fiercely competitive, traditionally low-margin grocery business is impressive.


Sprouts has an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of 99.


Walmart, Amazon Ensure Grocery Competition Is White-Hot
-------------------------------------------------------


**Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) is the most prominent publicly traded pure-play grocer, but the largest U.S. grocery seller **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and industry-disruptor **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are causing a kerfuffle in the sector.


Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods Market has pressured prices on store shelves, and the upscale market's integration with the e-commerce titan has resulted in incentives such as free two-hour Whole Foods delivery and 10% off certain items for Prime members.


Meanwhile, Walmart is in the process of rolling out online grocery delivery to 40% of American households by year-end. It's partnered with third-party couriers such as Postmates, Deliv and Uber to make it happen. [Walmart's recently awarded patents](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-patents-high-tech-grocery-delivery-plans/) also point to tech-forward innovation in the grocery space.

Kroger Earnings Coming Up
-------------------------


Kroger reports second-quarter results Thursday before the opening bell. Wall Street analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Kroger earnings of 38 cents a share, down from 39 cents in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue should edge up 0.8% to $27.82 billion. Look for updates on its own grocery delivery efforts in the wake of an expanded partnership with Instacart, and Kroger Ship, a newly launched direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform.


Kroger stock dipped 0.6% Friday after hitting an 18-month high on Thursday. Walmart stock fell 0.6% but is consolidating near a buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Amazon stock slid 0.3% Friday, near record highs and the $1 trillion valuation it reached on Tuesday.

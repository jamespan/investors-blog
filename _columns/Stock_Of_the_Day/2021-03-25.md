Home improvement giant **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, as the renovation boom continues amid a hot housing market. Lowe's stock is in buy range.




Lowe's operates 1,974 home-improvement and hardware stores in the U.S. and Canada. About 230 additional stores are dealer-owned.


Spring is typically peak season for Lowe's and rival **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), as people often begin projects around the house or outside.


While recently figures for sales of new and existing homes have shown some cooling, buyers are still eager to close deals and lock in mortgage rates as Treasury yields have stabilized.


Late Wednesday, homebuilder **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) reported mixed results, but demand remained strong. Signed contracts rose 23% to 4,292 in the three months through February.


Also late Wednesday, strong earnings and guidance from **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) also indicated [demand at the high end of the market remains robust](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-earnings-rh-stock-hot-renovation-trend/).


Lowe's Stock

But with the market looking so weak investors should be watching, not buying.


LOW stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) spiked recently, reaching highs not seen since early November and above levels in February when shares attempted a breakout.

Costs Weigh On Lowe's Earnings
------------------------------


Last month, the company posted strong fourth-quarter results. EPS surged 41% to 1.33, while revenue grew 27% to $20.3 million. Same-store sales jumped 28%, while U.S. sales comps grew 28.6%.


However, costs related to Covid put pressure on profits. In its Q4 earnings report, Lowe's said Covid-related costs to support hourly front-line workers totaled more than $100 million in Q4 and more than $900 million for fiscal 2020. Overall, Lowe's said it invested nearly $1.3 billion in Covid-related support for its associates, store safety and community pandemic relief in fiscal 2020.


In a call with investors after earnings, CFO David Denton warned that home-improvement sales would likely decline as more people get vaccinated and venture outdoors more. He said demand for the home improvement sector could drop 5%-10%.


As a result, growth is expected to take a breather next year as it comes up against tougher comparisons. Wall Street sees EPS increasing around 5% to $9.12 on a revenue decline of about 3.5% to $85.4 billion.


Despite the strong Q4 results, Lowe's stock fell Feb. 24 on its post-pandemic warning.


The retailer has been shifting its focus to contractors recently. CEO Marvin Ellison said at the company's last investor update day that Lowe's "strategy will enhance customer engagement and grow market share by intensifying our focus on the Pro customer, expanding our online business, modernizing installation services, improving localization efforts and elevating our product assortment."

Cloudflare shares fell 11% on May 8, a day after the firm reported first-quarter earnings. While Cloudflare earnings and revenue topped views, guidance disappointed amid high expectations driven by the work-from-home environment.


Cloudflare Stock Rebounds From 'Conservative' Guidance
------------------------------------------------------


Cloudflare maintained its prior 2020 outlook, which some analysts called conservative.


Shares in Cloudflare clawed back, hitting a mid-May record high of 30.78. Cloudflare stock consolidated, forming a [three-weeks-tight pattern on a weekly chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/).


In a three-weeks-tight pattern, the stock finishes no more than 1% to 1.5% above or below the prior week's close. Cloudflare's three-weeks-tight buy point is 30.69. Shares jumped 7.5% to close at 30.98 Monday.


Typically, tight entries are an opportunity for existing holders to buy a few more shares. But in several of these cases, investors could start new positions, especially with stocks consolidating just above prior bases.


Investors might want to wait for Cloudflare stock to form a longer, proper base, with an entry point of 30.88. That would be 10 cents above the mid-May record high.


The Cloudflare initial public offering, which priced at 18 a share last September, raised $525 million. Venrock Associates, which started out as the venture arm of the Rockefeller family, was among early investors.

Cloudflare Network 'Secret Sauce'
---------------------------------


Cloudflare offers a wide range of software-as-a-service products that leverage a global cloud network.


Approximately 10% of the Fortune 1,000 are paying customers and 10% of the top million websites use at least one Cloudflare solution, says a Morgan Stanley report. Cloudflare specializes in security as well as speeding up internet services and improving security.


The network spans nearly 200 cities and interconnects over 8,000 networks globally.


"The secret sauce of the network is that every commodity server in every city runs the entire Cloudflare software code stack," Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a report to clients. "Because of this, they don't have to think about putting certain features in certain regions, but importantly push out all new code or features across their entire network, which provides a significant competitive advantage and also allows them to profitably scale as they grow."


Cloudflare Stock Relative Strength Rating
-----------------------------------------


Cloudflare sells products that protect websites from Distributed Denial of Service botnet attacks. It also sells web application firewalls, competing with the likes of **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) and others. Other products protect Domain Name Services, a global directory of internet addresses, from malicious attacks.


In the consumer market, Cloudflare last year rolled out a mobile virtual private network. Cloudflare offers basic features for free.


Cloudflare stock holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95 out of a possible 99. The best stocks own ratings above 80.


Further, Cloudflare stock holds an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of B, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup).


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

**Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), a trucking company, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). ODFL stock is forming a handle amid a broad rebound for trucking stocks over the past two months.




ODFL stock is setting up as analysts brace for weaker demand for trucking services in the second half of this year. Rising prices for essentials are squeezing consumer demand for nonessential goods as many customers move on from the pandemic's at-home shopping boom.


But with **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) reaffirming guidance for the second half of the year after dealing with unwanted inventory this spring, perhaps the worst is over. Or at least priced in.


Old Dominion Freight Line says demand remains strong. But its shipping volumes have slipped recently.


ODFL Stock, Trucking Stocks
---------------------------


Its shares rose 9 cents to 303.31 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). As of Thursday's close ODFL stock has a handle after forming a consolidation going back to the end of 2021. The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 323.82.


However, a strong bounce off the 200-day line would break the downtrend of the handle, giving ODFL stock an early entry. Shares are currently finding support at that level.


ODFL stock is also a member of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Shares have a strong 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Their [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 98.


Other trucking stocks have also rebounded. IBD's Transportation-Truck industry group has been on an uptrend since June. It holds a strong No. 35 ranking, out of 197 industries IBD tracks.


Old Dominion offers so-called less-than-truckload, or LTL, transportation services. Less-than-truckload allows multiple customers to pack shipments into a single truck. That segment benefits from rising e-commerce demand.


Shipment Volumes Slip
---------------------


The company, in a filing this month, said that revenue per day in July rose 18.4%. However, shipments per day fell 2.6%.


Old Dominion's second-quarter results, reported last month, beat expectations. And even as spot and contract prices to ship goods via truck have shown signs of easing this year, management told trucking stocks analysts that its own customers haven't put up a lot of resistance to prices.


"So far, we haven't seen much of any at all of any customers asking for cheaper rates or any kind of exception pricing or anything such as that," CEO Greg Gantt said on Old Dominion's second-quarter earnings call last month. "I think from what we can tell, the industry is extremely disciplined."


The company reported as retailers like Walmart, TargetÂ and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) cut prices or take other actions to clear inventories, after ending up with an assortment of goods they couldn't sell.


Old Dominion, during its earnings call last month, said retailers made up around 25% to 30% of its business. But it said its industrial customers, which make up around 55% to 60%, were still expanding. CFO Adam Satterfield said its retail business was still going strong.


"It's just a little bit below the company average, but we're still seeing nice growth there," he said.

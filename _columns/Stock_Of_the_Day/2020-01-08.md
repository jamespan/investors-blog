**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as VRTX stock surges above a tight four-week pattern and rises from support at the 10-week moving average.


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), VRTX stock popped 3.3% for an all-time closing high of 231.09. It touched an all-time intraday high of 232.70. The biotech stock made a pullback after a [four-weeks-tight pattern.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) Shares surged over the last few days to top a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 225.76. Shares also are bouncing off the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/10-week-moving-average-serves-multiple-purposes/), which creates a similar buy area.


RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams says investors are feeling bullish on VRTX stock.


"Among large caps, investors mostly favor Vertex and [**Gilead Sciences**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/gilead-stock-buy-now/) ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) into 2020, with [**Biogen**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biogen-stock-buy-now/) ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) seen as the least favored among the top five (biotech stocks)," he said in a recent note to clients. "Among generalists, Vertex is the most favored name, followed by [**Amgen**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-buy-now/) ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN))."

VRTX Stock Gains On Cystic Fibrosis Drugs
-----------------------------------------


Vertex has made a name for itself in treating cystic fibrosis, a chronic and [deadly lung condition](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/147960.php). The hereditary disease causes the body to produce a thick and sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and pancreas. Patients often need to undergo frequent treatments to clear their airways.


There is no cure for cystic fibrosis. But Vertex is testing ways to treat the [underlying genetic roots](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qa-vertex-chief-talks-about-companys-transformational-year/) of the disease. Vertex currently sells four [treatments for cystic fibrosis](https://www.vrtx.com/medicines), each targeting a different genetic mutation causing the disease.


Its most recent addition, called Trikafta, can treat up to 90% of patients with the lung disease. [Trikafta gained](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-breakthrough-therapy-cystic-fibrosis) Food and Drug Administration approval in October 2019. Doctors prescribe the drug for patients 12 and older with specific genetic mutations.


Trikafta is a game-changer in cystic fibrosis treatment. It was the first-ever triple-combination drug for cystic fibrosis to gain FDA approval. It's a combination of three drugs — tezacaftor, ivacaftor and elexacaftor.


Ivacaftor already sells as a solo therapy for a subset of patients under the brand name Kalydeco. A combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor sells under the brand name Symdeko. [Symdeko gained FDA approval](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-symdekor-tezacaftorivacaftor-and-ivacaftor-treat) in June 2019 and treats yet another group of patients.


Trikafta Prescriptions On The Rise
----------------------------------


So far, Trikafta prescriptions appear strong, RBC's Abrahams said in another report. He has an outperform rating on VRTX stock. He expects $185 million in fourth-quarter sales of Trikafta, well above broader Street calls for $68 million.


There's a key caveat, however. Trikafta sales are likely cannibalizing some sales of Symdeko and Kalydeco, Abrahams said. He sees $359 million and $257 million in fourth-quarter sales of the two drugs, respectively. The Street is more bullish on Symdeko, calling for $406 million.


"Overall, we believe this should still enable a roughly $50 million cystic fibrosis sales beat for the fourth quarter," Abrahams said.


Further, international insurers and governments are now getting on board reimbursing patients for the cost of Vertex's drugs. This is helping the biotech stock to offer more accurate guidance. For the full year ending in December 2020, Abrahams sees north of $5 billion in cystic fibrosis drug sales.


He raised his price target on VRTX stock to 240 from 235.


"While valuation is becoming more optimistic, we believe a robust Trikafta launch, scarcity value as a low-risk high-quality growth biotech and growing enthusiasm around the pipeline could drive some additional appreciation," he said.


Vertex Teams Up With Biotech Stock Crispr
-----------------------------------------


Vertex also has tied its future with fellow biotech **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)). Crispr works on gene-editing drugs using a technique known as CRISPR. The duo was the first to begin clinical studies in humans of a [CRISPR gene-editing drug.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-gene-editing-biotech-companies/)


The two biotech stocks currently test potential treatments for blood diseases called sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. [Initial test results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-gene-editing-drug-shows-early-promise-human-studies/) in November 2019 were strong. The news sent Crispr stock popping 17% and VRTX stock up more than 2%.



Other key [CRISPR gene-editing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-stocks-dive-scientist-gene-editing-babies-sentenced-prison/) players include **Editas Medicine** ([EDIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDIT)) and **Intellia Therapeutics** ([NTLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTLA)).


Additional data acts as a potential catalyst for the biotech stocks in 2020, Needham analyst Alan Carr said in his own recent report to clients.


"We estimate launch by Crispr and collaborator Vertex in the U.S. in 2022 and Europe in 2023," he said. "Competitive is extensive, but even with modest penetration, we estimate peak 2032 global sales of just over $1 billion."


VRTX Is Profitable
------------------


Vertex is a rarity among biotech stocks — the company is profitable. Adjusted earnings have grown by at least a double-digit percentage for the past 12 quarters. In the third quarter, Vertex earned $1.23 a share. Earnings grew 13% year over year.


However, it's important to note that earnings growth has decelerated for three straight quarters. In the fourth quarter, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Vertex earnings to dip roughly 27%. They see sales popping 14.5% to $996 million.


Earnings growth is expected to reaccelerate in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Analysts see earnings rising almost 16% in Q3 and nearly 37% in Q4.


Biotech Stock Has Strong IBD Ratings
------------------------------------


The strong history of earnings growth is reflected in Vertex's Investor's Business Daily [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) of 97 out of 99. The EPS Rating tracks a stock's recent profitability, putting VRTX stock in the top 3% of all stocks on this metric.


Shares of the biotech stock also have a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99. That puts VRTX stock in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The industry group of biotech stocks now ranks first out of 197 industry groups IBD tracks.


Holders of the stock include Fidelity's vaunted Magellan fund (FMAGX) as well as Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), both of which increased their stakes last month. A number of other A rated funds are adding positions.


Vertex also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 88, a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. In those terms, VRTX stock is among the upper echelon of leaders with an RS Rating of 80 or higher.


Shares of Vertex were also recently added to [IBD's Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).

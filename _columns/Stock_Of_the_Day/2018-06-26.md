**Usana Health Sciences** ([USNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USNA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the health supplements stock closing in on a buy point from a new base after a big run. Usana stock rose 2.3% Tuesday while shares of Cosmetics/Personal Care group peers **Herbalife Nutrition** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) and **Nu Skin** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) advanced nearly 1%.




Usana stock earns an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 95 out of 99. Other standouts from Usana's industry group include **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)), with a 99 Composite Rating, and **Weight Watchers** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)), with a 97. Herbalife has a rating of 90 while Nu Skin has an 88. Top stocks typically have a high Composite Rating — which includes metrics such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins and return on equity — when they make big moves.


Usana Stock Action
------------------


Shares are rebounding from the 10-week line and from just above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/) on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) after finding support at that level on Monday. But so far, the bounce is coming in lighter-than-average volume.


If a stock can rebound off its 50-day/10-week line powerfully, that can lead to a [buying opportunity](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/). But investors looking to get in on Usana stock may see a fresh chance to buy shares soon.

Herbalife Stock, Nu Skin Stock
------------------------------


Usana's group peers are looking strong as well.

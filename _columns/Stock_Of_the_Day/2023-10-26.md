Dow Jones retail behemoth **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Thursday. Walmart stock is basing near a buy point while its relative strength line surges to new highs amid the weaker market.




Retailers largely buckled in Q2 on concerns of softer consumer spending after reporting big gains at the start of the year. Meanwhile, [organized crime and retail theft continue to gouge earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-theft-losses-mount-from-shoplifting-flash-mobs-organized-crime/) and is a growing problem for the industry.


[Walmart earnings growth slowed to 4% for Q2 2024 results](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-dow-jones-giant-target-face-widely-divergent-earnings-expectations/) after two quarters of accelerating, double-digit gains. Revenue growth hovered in the mid- to upper-single digits the past five quarters. Still, the results beat expectations of a 3.4% earnings decline on 4.8% revenue growth.


Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 24% for the quarter. Comparable sales excluding fuel rose 6.3% and beat Wall Street estimates of 4.3% growth. Same-store sales at Sam's Club rose 5.5% while Walmart U.S. stores saw a 6.4% increase in comparable traffic.


Walmart lifted its outlook on results and guided full-year adjusted earnings of $6.36-$6.46 per share on 4% to 4.5% net sales growth. The outlook was ahead of analyst forecasts of $6.30 per share and in-line with revenue predictions of $637.93 billion. The company previously expected EPS of $6.10-$6.20 on 3.5% sales growth.


Walmart expects earnings between $1.45 and $1.50 per share on 3% net sales growth for Q3 results on Nov. 16. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Q3 earnings of $1.49 per share on $157.22 billion in revenue.


The Dow Jones stock ranks third in the Retail-Major Discount Chains industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) leads the industry group.


Among other discount retailers, Costco, **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) and **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) are holding up fairly well.


Rival **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), however, has tumbled 25.7% so far this year and is trading at its lowest levels since April 2020.

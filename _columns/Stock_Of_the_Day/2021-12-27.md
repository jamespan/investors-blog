**Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The U.S. producer of shale oil broke above a short-term trend line on Monday as it rebounded from 50-day support. This gave investors a double-shot early buying opportunity, within a forming consolidation. OAS stock soared Monday.




Oil and gas production from U.S. shale reservoirs has boomed over the last decade, enabling U.S. producers to take on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Independent oil companies focused primarily on shale areas proliferated before a downturn in oil prices sparked a wave of bankruptcies and consolidation in 2015. The industry shakeout continued in 2020 and 2021 amid the drop in oil prices caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.


The publicly traded independent companies that remain, or have returned, are now generally committed to improving their balance sheets and returning cash to shareholders in 2022.


Oasis Petroleum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2020. It jumped back into publicly traded status a month later with a squeaky-clean balance sheet. The oil producer sold its holdings in the Permian basin for $481 million in May. In October, Oasis agreed to sell its interest in **Oasis Midstream Partners** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) to private equity firm Crestwood Equity Partners for $1.8 billion.


Those moves freed Oasis to concentrate its operations and newly raised capital on the Willison formation in North and South Dakota, where it has leases on 497,000 acres. It produced 77,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter.

OAS Stock Flashes An Early Buying Opportunity
---------------------------------------------


Shares jumped 7.3% to 130.42 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). OAS stock bounced briskly off support at its 50-day moving average. At the same time, the move broke past a short term trend line which provided investors an [early buying opportunity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 123.09, just above the stock's high from Thursday.


That double-dose entry is a good place for aggressive investors to jump in. More cautious investors can wait to see if OAS stock forms a base on its weekly chart. In order to do that, it would need to remain below the current pattern's left-side high through the end of the current week. If it does that, it would create a valid buy point at 133.30.


In November, Oasis reported Q3 earnings that topped Wall Street expectations and sent the stock further into profit-taking range. The stock has rallied 254% so far in 2021.


Following its strong gains, the stock was recently added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/).

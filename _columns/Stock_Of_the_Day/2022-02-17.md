**Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the railroad operator rides efficiency gains and contract wins to outpace inflation. UNP stock ended the day just a hair below a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), holding up much better than the broad stock market amid growing concerns that Russia will invade Ukraine.




On Union Pacific's Jan. 20 Q4 earnings call, the company highlighted why it may be a solid bet in the current inflationary growth environment.


Amid Covid supply-chain issues that bottlenecked ports and halted some auto production, Union Pacific saw 1% less volume in 2021 vs. 2019. Meanwhile, operating-efficiency gains helped fuel a 16% increase in operating income.


Union Pacific's operating ratio, expenses as a share of revenue, eased to 57.2% in 2021, the fifth straight yearly improvement. The company expects it to fall further, to 55.5%, in 2022.


PSR: Rail Profit and Efficiency vs. Labor Unions
------------------------------------------------


Union Pacific attributes much of its progress to precision scheduled railroading. PSR management minimizes dwell time — the time customer carloads wait for an available to train to get moving — while extending train length. Union Pacific's average train length increased 2% to 9,300 feet in 2021.


Fewer, longer trains means more railcars can run on a given line at any one time. Trains haul more goods and schedules are more predictable. Most important, longer trains require fewer employees, which is why labor unions are lobbying Congress in an attempt to discourage the spread of PSR strategies.


Still, as supply-chain constraints ease through 2022, Union Pacific stands to benefit from a recovery. The company's auto volume was down 10% from a year ago in Q4. That recovery should add to gains from client wins. Trucking firm **Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings** ([KNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNX)) shifted its intermodal business — deliveries requiring both truck and rail — to Union Pacific at the start of the year.


Coal should provide another tailwind, with two recent client wins and elevated demand amid higher natural gas prices.


Management's early take-away from contract negotiations: "With a strong overall demand environment and our disciplined pricing approach, we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars," said CFO Jennifer Hamann.

UNP Stock
---------


UNP stock slipped 1.1% to 250.99 in Thursday's stock market action. That leaves UNP stock just shy of a 256.21 buy point from a six-week flat base, according to a [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) analysis.


UNP stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the chart provided that tracks its progress vs. the S&P 500, is hitting a multiyear high. That's an encouraging sign of market leadership, especially when it happens before a stock breaks out.



Keep in mind, the Nasdaq Composite is down more than 11% year-to-date, and the stock market's status reads "[uptrend under pressure.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-reversal-on-fed-minutes-bullish-signs-to-watch-right-now/)" That means even breakouts by leading stocks should be handled very cautiously. One way to do that is by studying up on [options buying strategies.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/)


UNP has a strong 92 [IBD Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-union-pacific-corp-unp.aspx) out of a possible 99, a single rating that combines fundamental and technical factors. That tied for the best in [the Transportation-Rail industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-feb-16-2022/).


While the overall market has declined, UNP stock has traded mostly above its 50-day moving average, with the current buy point just above that technical level of support.

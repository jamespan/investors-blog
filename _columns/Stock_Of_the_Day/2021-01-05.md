**JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the China e-commerce company jumped into a buy zone Tuesday on a good day overall for China stocks. JD stock hit a record high.




The jump in JD stock comes as the New York Stock Exchange early Tuesday reversed course, saying it will now not delist shares of China's big three state-owned telecommunications operators. That decision also appeared to boost other China stocks Tuesday, including **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)).


JD stock jumped 10.6% to close at 95.50 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares moved above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 92.87 out of a consolidation, jumping above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) as well as the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) — both being positive indicators.


Pinduoduo also hit a new high, leaping 10.6%, near 184.60, while Alibaba climbed 5%, near 239.30. Tencent rose 4.6%, near 76.20.

The NYSE, in a [brief statement](https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/NYSE-Updates-Guidance-on-Delisting-Determination-for-Securities-of-Three-Issuers-in-Relation-to-Executive-Order-13959--/default.aspx) announcing its reversal, said it changed course after "further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities." The move to delist was initially prompted by an executive order from President Donald Trump.


JD Stock: Offering A Vast Selection
-----------------------------------


JD.com has a multitude of business units and offers a vast selection of products across every major category. This includes electronics, apparel, home furnishings and appliances. It also sells fresh produce and other groceries. In addition, it's also transforming to become a leading supply-chain-based technology and service provider.


Further, it holds strategic partnerships with **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and Tencent, among others. JD competes primarily with Alibaba in the e-commerce space, followed by Pinduoduo.


Also on Tuesday, JD stock was upgraded to buy from hold as Stifel analyst Scott Devitt said the company faces a "multifaceted growth opportunity" in the years ahead.


"JD has the opportunity to monetize investment stakes in newer businesses, which should be additive to the company's equity value as valuation events occur," Devitt wrote in a note to clients.


Trends Supporting Healthy Long-Term Growth
------------------------------------------


In addition, he said JD.com has a number of "secular growth trends to support healthy long-term growth and ongoing margin expansion." Devitt raised his price target on JD stock to 150, up from 84.


JD.com reported [third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-stock-jd-com-earnings-q3-2020/) on Nov. 16 that beat on the bottom line and met on sales. It reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share, vs. Wall Street expectations of 41 cents. Revenue climbed 29% to $25.66 billion, matching estimates.


The company has achieved double-digit revenue growth every quarter going back several years and has been consistently profitable.


In addition, annual active customer accounts grew 32% for the 12-month period to 441.6 million.

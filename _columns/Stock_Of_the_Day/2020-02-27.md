**TAL Education Group** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), a private after-school tutoring provider in China, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


Even as the coronavirus outbreak closes schools, stores and factories in China, TAL Education stock has only fallen modestly, and has outperformed amid the current stock market correction. So have rivals **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)).




The stock's [relative strength line](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), which measures a stock's performance against the S&P 500, has risen to an all-time high even as the benchmark index reels over fears about the virus's impact on the global economy. Stocks whose relative strength lines rise in a market correction often are early leaders when a new rally takes hold.


The relative strength line of New Oriental Education, another education provider in China, is also at record highs. The RS line for GSX Techedu, is just off its highs. GSX stock has skyrocketed during the coronavirus crisis, as investors bet on its online-only model.

TAL Education Stock
-------------------


Shares fell 2% to 55.16 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). That's not far from TAL Education's peak of 59.76 on Feb. 14. TAL Education stock is well-extended from a 39.76 buy point from a late-October breakout, as well as a late-January rebound from the 10-week line. TAL Education stock needs several weeks to form a new base, though it could test support at its 10-week line again.


But investors should put TAL Education on their watchlists, as its RS line is setting new highs.



Also keep an eye on New Oriental Education stock and GSX stock. New Oriental Education stock rebounded from its 10-week line Thursday. It's been consolidating for several weeks near record highs. GSX stock has been red-hot since late November, with the coronavirus-related boost adding to huge earnings growth. GSX stock came public at 10.50 a share last June.


New Oriental Education stock reversed lower to close down 0.8%. GSX stock fell 3.45%.


TAL Education Expands Online Options
------------------------------------


TAL Education provides K-12 tutoring services in small and personalized classes, as well as online, its website says. It offers those services in 50 cities in China. TAL Education also runs jzb.com, an online education source. During the company's [most recent quarter](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/new-oriental-education-earnings-q2-2020-tal-education-earnings-q3-2020/), which ended on Nov. 30, student enrollments for standard-priced long-term courses jumped 66% to roughly 2.3 million.


With schools in China closed in an effort to prevent further transmission of the coronavirus, more parents have put students in online classes, a [CNBC article noted](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/19/coronavirus-chinas-after-school-programs-to-shut-down-or-move-online.html) last week.


An analyst told the news outlet that the coronavirus outbreak "could make online tutoring more acceptable to once hesitant parents and potentially contribute longer term to online tutoring penetration in China."


TAL Education, that article noted, has increased its advertising for its online education services. Still, there are questions over whether demand might strain companies' ability to provide education services online, and the impact the coronavirus outbreak will have on the private education industry's offline courses in China.


In January, TAL CFO Rong Luo said during the company's third-quarter conference call that the company had "no idea" what course the virus's development might take, and that they would try to be conservative in their revenue forecasts. And he said they had fully followed government guidelines to make necessary changes in its offline learning center.


TAL Education Earnings
----------------------


TAL Education earnings have fallen sharply for the last three quarters. Analysts expect TAL earnings for fiscal 2020, which is just about to end, to tumble 73%. But sales growth has accelerated for the past two quarters. TAL Education earnings should surge 300% in fiscal 2021.


Despite its recent EPS woes, TAL Education stock has a strong 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 44.

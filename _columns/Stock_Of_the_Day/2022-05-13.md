CF Industries stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the ammonia producer makes a bullish move offering an aggressive buy point amid strong dynamics in the nitrogen industry.




**CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) says worldwide demand for nitrogen remains robust, driven by the need to replenish grain stockpiles. Meanwhile, global inventories of nitrogen, used to make fertilizers, remain extremely tight.

Nitrogen, Hydrogen And Russia-Ukraine war
-----------------------------------------


"Global grains (supplies) remain extremely low, an issue that has become amplified because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine," CF Industries CEO Tony Will said in a May 4 earnings release. "We think it will take at least two to three years to replenish global grains stocks."


Russia's nitrogen exports took a hit from various sanctions due to the Ukraine war, as well as Russian government-imposed export limits.


Meanwhile, CF is charging ahead on "green hydrogen" (produced through a carbon-free process) as global economies shift to cleaner fuels.

Though far from sexy, fertilizer companies produce a vital product with generally durable demand. CF Industries, the world's largest ammonia producer and an [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock, has cushioned portfolios for many investors during the market's current downslide.


Green hydrogen and ammonia are key elements of the constellation of strategies through which companies, industries and countries are navigating toward net-zero carbon emissions.


By 2050, hydrogen will meet 20% of the world's energy needs, according to some forecasts. That would be up from less than 1% today. Ammonia is three parts hydrogen and one part nitrogen. It's used as a means to transport hydrogen, as well as being a fuel in its own right, CF says.


Deerfield, Ill.-based CF Industries produces 10 million tons of ammonia per year and nearly 2 million tons of hydrogen annually.


CF Industries Stock Technical Analysis
--------------------------------------


Shares of CF Industries rose 5.7% to 103.86 amid a strong, broad rebound on the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) The chart showed that move as a rebound off the 50-day moving average, putting CF stock around 104.48. The bounce, at least intraday, broke above a trendline drawn from the April 13 peak of 113.49. The break offered an entry for aggressive investors.


Notwithstanding the market's two-day rally attempt, the market status remains "market in correction." That means this is a time to be building watchlists, until a follow-through day confirms a new uptrend.


For investors who do choose to nibble at CF stock, a reversal below the 100 price level or 50-day area of support would be a sell signal.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for CF Industries stock has shot up to a 52-week high.

This highly rated stock remains above short- and long-term levels of support while the S&P 500 remains mired below those key technical markers.

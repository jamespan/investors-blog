**West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the pandemic continues to fluff sales and WST stock stares down three buy points.




The company isn't a drug developer. Rather, West Pharma makes vials, syringes and other tools to deliver injectable drugs. Its customers are drugmakers, including those working on treatments and vaccines to tackle Covid-19.


Company spokeswoman Michele Pelkowski says West Pharma is working closely with developers of vaccines and therapeutics targeting Covid-19.


"We believe these close working relationships help us to manage and fully address the various supply scenarios so that we can provide the critical components for primary containment of both existing injectable drugs as well as vaccines/drugs for the pandemic," she said in an email.


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), WST stock rose a fraction to 299.79.

WST Stock: Bullish Earnings Growth
----------------------------------


West Pharmaceutical was established in 1923. At the time, the biggest challenge was figuring out how to safely deliver medicine to injured soldiers on the battlefield. Then, West Pharma co-founder Herman O. West created a rubber closure for a vial to safely package penicillin.


Today, West Pharma makes 100 million [components for drug delivery](https://investor.westpharma.com/static-files/75ecc588-0d09-427a-979f-ad8fc0a7f818) every day, according to the company's presentation at the recent J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. It has 2,000 customers across the health care industry.


The biggest share of its sales — 29% — come from biologic drugmakers. The biggest among them are **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and [**Moderna**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/) ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)). Pharma, contract-manufactured products and generics account for 28%, 24% and 19% of sales, respectively.


Analysts polled by FactSet expect West Pharma's December-ended quarter sales to grow 15% to $540.4 million. The company is also expected to earn $1.12 per share, minus some items. Earnings would be 37% higher.


Less bullish for WST stock: Sales and earnings growth would decelerate vs. the prior quarter.


Covid-19 Vaccines Are Key
-------------------------


Still, the company is working hard to boost its supply amid the pandemic. To meet the burgeoning supply needs, West Pharma said it expanded existing sites and added personnel to move to a 24/7 operating schedule.



West Pharmaceutical also increased its capital expenditures in 2020 to prepare for the increased demand due to Covid-19 vaccines. Today, just Moderna, and [**Pfizer**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) with its development partner **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), have authorized vaccines in the U.S.


But others are likely to join. [**Novavax**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvax-stock-buy-now/) ([NVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVAX)) and [**Johnson & Johnson**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/) ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) just unveiled late-stage test results. Further, [**AstraZeneca**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/astrazeneca-stock-buy-now/)'s ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) University of Oxford-partnered coronavirus vaccine is already authorized in countries outside the U.S.


West Pharma hasn't yet announced fourth-quarter results. But consolidated organic sales growth from January to September 2020 was 15.1%, according to the company's recent presentation. On a reported basis, sales grew at a 7.1% compounded annual rate from 2015-19.


WST Stock Considers Three Entries
---------------------------------


All this puts WST stock on track for three buy points.


According to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), WST stock broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 305.10 in early January.


But investors could also use the top of a high handle at 312.22 as a potential entry. They could also split the difference and buy around 309.14. That would be just above last week's high for WST stock.


Importantly, the RS line is improving and is near where it was when WST stock hit a high earlier in the month.


Further, [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital) shows WST stock has a strong [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/#:~:text=What%20Is%20The%20IBD%20EPS%20Rating%3F&text=An%20EPS%20Rating%20of%2099,stock%20charts%20at%20Investors.com.) of 96, reflecting its bout of double-digit profit growth.


[WST stock](https://www.investors.com/research/west-pharmaceutical-ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-coronavirus-vaccine-play-nears-buy-point/) was also recently an [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/). It ranks No. 35 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of elite growth stocks.

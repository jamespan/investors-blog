**Regal Beloit** ([RBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the power generator and electric motor manufacturer boasts accelerating growth and a wider product lineup. RBC stock roared into buy range Thursday.




Wisconsin-based Regal Beloit makes "motors, bearings, gearing, conveying, blowers, electric components, and couplings," according to the company. Its products can be found in farm equipment, pool and spa equipment and commercial HVAC systems. It owns nearly 30 brands including Marathon Motors and Marathon Generators, Browning and Milwaukee Gear.


Last month, Regal agreed to buy **Rexnord Corp.**'s ([RXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RXN)) bearings, couplings and gears unit with [Regal in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction](https://www.regalbeloit.com/News/Regal-to-combine-with-rexnords-pmc-segment). The deal is expected to close in Q4, pending regulatory approval.


Regal has also found other ways to expand its business amid Covid-19. Improving air filtration systems have been a major issue during the pandemic. The company has developed a new air treatment system that uses UV light to keep the air free of viruses and bacteria.


"We see lots of potential for this product, even beyond Covid-19 as end users become more interested in keeping indoor air free of all kinds of pathogens," CEO Louis Pinkham said during last month's Q4 earnings call.

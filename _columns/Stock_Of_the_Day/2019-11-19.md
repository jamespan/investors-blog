**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as shares moved into a buy zone Tuesday. Facebook stock broke out from a cup-with-handle pattern.




The social media behemoth is getting renewed attention after a [third-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-raises-price-target-strong-earnings/) that eased concerns about spending and revenue deceleration. Revenue jumped 29% to $17.65 billion. Adjusted earnings jumped 20%, reversing two straight quarters of declining earnings and exceeding expectations.


Facebook stock climbed 2% in reaction to the Oct. 30 earnings report. On Tuesday, Facebook stock moved up 1% to close 199.32 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares climbed above a buy point of 198.19 from a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). Facebook's buy range tops out at 208.10.


The company is among the big-cap winners of the decade. Facebook stock soared more than 500% from July 2013 to July 2018. Since then, shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, as growth moderates and regulators and politicians take aim at the company over consumer privacy issues. Yet Facebook seems to have regained its stride.

Price Target On Facebook Stock Raised
-------------------------------------


Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, after the earnings report, raised his price target on Facebook stock to 250, from 235. He maintained a rating of overweight.


In a note to clients, Nowak cited three key bullish take-aways from [Facebook earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-earnings-revenue-beat-third-quarter-estimates/).


One is that Facebook user engagement trends remain strong and broadly based. Second, strong user engagement and innovation at Facebook boost its ability to increase revenue. Third, increased revenue leads to higher earnings power and free cash flow.


Facebook ended the third quarter with 1.62 billion daily active users, an increase of 9% year over year. Monthly active users topped 2.45 billion, up 8%.


Facebook has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 98. The rating means Facebook stock currently outperforms 98% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria


It also has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 87. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of the other stocks.


Further, the stock earns an 85 EPS Rating, meaning its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth is outpacing 85% of all stocks. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


Relative Strength Line Lags
---------------------------


Facebook's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has moved sideways since August. A breakout of that line, which shows how Facebook stock performs vs. the S&P 500 index, would be a positive sign that Facebook is returning to a period of outperformance.


Facebook holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) also are among the group's highest-rated stocks.


Last week, Facebook announced Facebook Pay. That allows Facebook users to send money across the company's major assets: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. The announcement sent Facebook stock up 4% that day.


Facebook Pay securely stores and encrypts credit card and bank account information. It also offers additional security features, including biometric identification.


"We believe Facebook Play is a materially positive step by Facebook as it should help the company build out an actionable marketplace by enabling e-commerce transactions on Instagram and Facebook," RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a recent note to clients.


Mahaney has an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 270.

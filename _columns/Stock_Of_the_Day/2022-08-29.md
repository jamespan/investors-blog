It's the largest federal government spending increase on alternative energy in U.S. history. Further, its impact could last over the next decade.


Tripling Domestic Manufacturing Capacity
----------------------------------------


A White House statement said the U.S. is on track to triple domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 2024. It sees the passage of the inflation act spurring greater interest in clean energy and solar energy stocks.


When SunPower reported [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sunpower-stock-second-quarter-beat-estimates/) in early August, the company said it accumulated 19,700 new customers. That's a 51% increase from the year-ago period and an all-time quarterly high.


"We continue to bring in new homebuilders and their communities that are planned and under construction," SunPower Chief Executive Peter Faricy said in a call with SPWR stock analysts following the quarterly earnings report.


"In Q2, we saw a 46% increase in contracted active construction communities where solar is a standard offer on every home," he continued. "This brings our contracted backlog in new homes to 34,000 customers, with another 40,000 potential customers in the pipeline."


In the second quarter, SunPower reported a 63% surge in revenue to $362 million. Adjusted earnings of 3 cents a share beat estimates of 2 cents. SunPower stock surged 9.4% in reaction to the earnings report.


"This is a clear indication of how higher pricing is working its way into our results without dampening customer appetite," Faricy said.

Pinterest, the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) on Wednesday, sparked a [key sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) two weeks ago. At the time, Pinterest stock took a beating.




On March 3, in the heart of the Nasdaq's latest serious decline, the NYSE-listed social media and digital marketing play dropped nearly 8.4%. Volume increased vs. the prior day. It wasn't heavy, but the stock closed mildly beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Normally, top stocks find institutional buying support at this [medium-term technical indicator](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). That all changed the next day.


**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) got whacked by sellers again on March 4. Pinterest stock slid almost 7.5%. And this time, volume surged.

By day's end, 22.9 million shares exchanged hands. That came in 81% higher than the average volume for Pinterest stock over the past 50 trading sessions.


Watch The Volume On Pinterest Stock
-----------------------------------


On the [Investors.com daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) just below, notice how the volume bar, drawn in red, towered well above the red line draped across the volume section of the chart. That red line represents a stock's 50-day moving average in turnover.



After a long run-up, top stocks trigger this [key defensive sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). That is, when they lose buying support at the 50-day line or the 10-week moving average — as plotted on the weekly stock chart down farther — the action suggests sellers are more anxious to sell than the buyers are more willing to buy.


Amid renewed weakness in the Nasdaq, Pinterest shares fell more than 5% in early-afternoon trading Thursday. Turnover was running lighter than normal. For the week, it's giving back only a small portion of the prior week's 5.3% rebound.


At this point, the stock market is back in a [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). The Nasdaq recently bottomed out at 12,397, for a 12.5% decline from its all-time peak at 14,175. Healthy, indeed. While short of a full-blown bear market, any correction in the range of 10% to 19% gets called an "intermediate correction."


Intermediate corrections offer the market a chance to release some speculative steam. That's good for stocks. When action gets vertical on the upside, it usually signals a significant top is near.



Pinterest stock has certainly rebounded nicely, and now trades less than 21% off its all-time high.


From its near-term low of 60.33, the large cap — with a $45 billion market value and 629 million shares outstanding — and member of IBD's internet content industry group has bounced as much as 24%. On Tuesday, shares briefly aimed at overcoming upside resistance at their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). But on that day, the stock failed to close above this key technical level.


Is This A Second Chance To Take Profits In Pinterest Stock?
-----------------------------------------------------------


Plus, volume has been mostly lower vs. the heavy turnover witnessed during the sell-offs of March 4, 5 and 8. Shares climbed 1.6% Wednesday to close at 74.95.


When top stocks have truly topped, they initially sell off hard, then climb back some. But they typically don't see robust turnover on the rebound. Such action actually serves as a [second chance to take profits in a great stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-weak-rebound-action-after-violating-the-50-day-line/).


David Ryan, a three-time champion in the equities division of the annual U.S. Investing Championships, discussed in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) the concept of "weekly wedges" — rebounds in lighter turnover after deep sell-offs in top tech stocks.


Ryan noted how weekly wedging action can also create a [short-selling opportunity](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-short-side/) in the near term. He also likes to see upside resistance by a stock at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) to confirm a stock's newfound price weakness.


Keep in mind that [short selling](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-short-side/) carries enormous risks and such trading should only be considered by the most intrepid investors.


Indeed, following the Federal Reserve's announcement on interest rate policy, techs rebounded with force.


Pinterest, with less than an hour to go in the regular session, showed a 4.6% gain for the week.


At 75.03, the stock held a measly 1.1% below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/), which continues to rise.


Pinterest's Numbers
-------------------


A major online force among hobbyists and artisans, Pinterest has shown lustrous fundamentals.


Earnings vaulted 258% in the fourth quarter of 2020 vs. year-ago levels to 43 cents a share. That's a quarterly best. Revenue rose 76% to $705.6 million, also a quarterly record. The Street sees these profits continue to power higher, up 100% this year to 84 cents a share and an additional 46% in 2022.


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Pinterest stock gets a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. Use the [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) chiefly as a stock research and selection tool, not as a timing tool for buying or selling.


The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94 remains high. Keep in mind that this tracks 12-month price performance. But the rating has extra weighting toward the latest three months' worth of action.

Sales, Earnings Expected To Accelerate
--------------------------------------


Simulations Plus makes software that provides modeling and simulation for [pharma and biotech](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/), industrial chemicals, cosmetics, food ingredients and herbicide industries.


The model-based drug development helps [pharma and biotech companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) make better data-driven decisions, according to the company's website.


Growth tapered somewhat in mid-2018 before hitting a new stride in 2019. Now, sales growth has accelerated for two consecutive quarters. After a rare earnings decline in December 2018, earnings have now accelerated for two straight periods.


In its most recent quarterly report, [Simulations Plus posted earnings](https://www.irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/3911886) of 16 cents a share on $9.9 million in sales, rising 23% and 16%, respectively.


Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect growth to speed up in the medical technology company's fiscal fourth quarter. Then, they call for Simulations Plus to earn 9 cents per share on $8 million in sales, up a respective 29% and 19% year over year.



The full year could provide even stronger acceleration. Analysts expect sales to pop 43.5% this year to $33 million. That would be Simulations Plus's eighth consecutive year of sales growth acceleration. Analysts expect earnings to rise 9.5% to 46 cents per share.


Sales growth is expected to moderate in 2020, rising just 18.2% as earnings fly 37%.


Simulations Plus Stock Is A Leader
----------------------------------


Simulations Plus stock leads the industry group of medical software companies. Further, the industry group itself is a top performer. It's No. 16 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily.


Shares of Simulations Plus have a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) and [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 99. The CR measures a stock's key growth metrics, while the RS Rating is a measure of a stock's 12-month performance.


The medical technology company has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 94 out of a potential 99. This puts Simulations Plus stock in the top 6% of all stocks in terms of profitability. But the stock shows signs of overheating.


Shares are well above their [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/). When stocks surge 70% to 100% above their 200-day averages, it can be a sell signal for a fast-advancing stock. Also, Simulations Plus is making a bearish reversal for the week.


Aggressive investors could consider Simulations Plus a [short-selling option](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/). The target for such a trade would be when the stock falls to the 50-day moving average. The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/)'s uptrend is now under pressure, which would push stocks lower.

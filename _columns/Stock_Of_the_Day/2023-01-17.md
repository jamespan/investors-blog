**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day for Tuesday as MNST stock nears an early entry for its flat base.




Corona, Calif.-based Monster Beverage leads an energy-drink duopoly with privately held competitor Red Bull. The company's portfolio of energy drink brands include Monster Energy, Reign and NOS Energy.


Monster dominates energy drinks in the U.S. and claimed a 39% market share last year, according to Jefferies data, resulting in a record $5.5 billion in revenue for the company. Red Bull accounted for 37% of the American energy drink market in 2021. **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), [which is on an impressive growth streak](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/celh-stock-celsius-holdings-hot-growth-streak-could-disrupt-energy-drink-duopoly/), only claimed 4.9% of the market.


Monster's products span various performance beverage categories, with lines of hydration drinks and teas. And the company is expanding into the alcoholic beverage market following the $330 million acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery last February. This month, Monster plans to roll out the first flavored malt beverage under its namesake brand, called The Beast Unleashed.


Still, Monster's earnings have fallen for the past five quarters despite quarterly sales averaging 16% growth during that time. Aluminum-can shortages, higher transportation costs and a stronger U.S. dollar bit into profits and margins, the company noted in its Q3 results in early November. But Monster says it's already seeing supply challenges and aluminum prices easing, according to the quarterly report.


And analysts expect Monster to buck the negative earnings trend with its Q4 results in early March. Wall Street sees consistent earnings and revenue growth throughout 2023. Earnings are expected to grow an average 27% over the next five quarters, with revenue averaging 11.6% gains over the year.


The company's board of directors approved a $500 million stock repurchase program at the beginning of November.

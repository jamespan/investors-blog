**GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the "new" pure-play aerospace S&P 500 component is honing in on an early entry for aggressive investors atop a 60% run so far this year.




The aerospace and defense pure-play company emerged from General Electric's big, long-term breakup, after the spinouts of **GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)) and **GE HealthCare Technologies** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)). GE Aerospace kept the GE ticker symbol.


Before the spinouts, General Electric shed a number of assets and operations over a series of years, from lighting to locomotives. In November 2017, [GE began signaling the breakup process amid financial troubles](https://www.investors.com/news/general-electric-may-sell-this-fantastic-business-as-rivals-gain/).


GE Aerospace, once called GE's "crown jewel," makes jet engines and aviation systems for plane-makers like **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), as well as the military. It also runs a lucrative aftermarket business for engine repair and maintenance.


GE Aerospace's jet-engine rivals include **RTX** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)) and Rolls-Royce. It also competes with companies such as **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) in aviation systems.


The company reports second-quarter earnings and revenue on July 23 before the market opens. Analysts predict EPS coming in at 98 cents with revenue totaling $8.53 billion.


The Company's Outlook
---------------------


For fiscal 2024, GE Aerospace expects adjusted earnings to range from $3.80 to $4.05 per share with free cash flow exceeding $5 billion. During its Q1 report in April, GE raised its total operating profit outlook to range from $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, from the prior guidance of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.

Analysts forecast a 2024 earnings increase to $4.07 per share on $36.59 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.


The company expects commercial engines and services revenue to grow in the mid-to-high teens. GE lifted its operating profit outlook for the business segment by $100 million, to range from $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion.


Defense and propulsion technologies revenue is seen rising in the mid- to high-single-digits. GE expects its defense operating profit between $1 billion and $1.3 billion.


[In early March](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-targets-investor-day-ge-stock/), GE Aerospace pared its 2025 revenue outlook to low double-digit growth, which is the lower end of its prior range of up to double-digit sales growth in the high teens. The company forecasts an operating profit of about $7.3 billion as the midpoint for the year. The outfitÂ aims to reach an operating profit of $10 billion in 2028.

Square stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares in the digital payment firm rally in the wake of its acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay in a $29 billion all-stock deal.




**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) announced the purchase of Afterpay, which competes in the emerging "buy now, pay later" installment payment market, late Sunday. The purchase price represents a 31% premium to Afterpay's closing price on Friday.


Square also reported mixed second-quarter results. It topped estimates on earnings but missed on revenue.


Square stock popped 10.2% to 272.38 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). SQ stock cleared an alternative entry from a handle base. A 5% buy zone above the new 267.87 entry extends to 281.26. The alternative entry is within a 23-week consolidation pattern.

Square Stock: BNPL Encroaches On Credit Card Networks
-----------------------------------------------------


The [big acquisition](https://investors.squareup.com/news/news-details/2021/Square-Inc.-Announces-Plans-to-Acquire-Afterpay-Strengthening-and-Enabling-Further-Integration-Between-its-Seller-and-Cash-App-Ecosystems/default.aspx) by Square comes amid increasing competition in the "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) segment involving **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and others. Merchants offer BNPL financing to consumers primarily during checkout when they shop online. BNPL offerings encroach on credit card networks and other consumer financing alternatives.


Square said it plans to integrate Afterpay into its Cash App consumer business.


"This is a big bet on BNPL for Square, forgoing internal investment to acquire one of the largest platforms in the space," Macquarie Capital analyst Paul Golding said in a report.


The acquisition is expected to close in early 2022. "The transaction is expected to be accretive to gross profit growth in year one after closing, but be modestly dilutive to adjusted EBITDA margins before synergies," Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg said in a report. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.


In its core business, Square aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money. Amid the coronavirus emergency, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks.


SQ stock had 40 million Cash App monthly active users as of June 30, up from 36 million at the end of 2020.


Buy Now, Pay Later Products Involve Credit Risk
-----------------------------------------------


For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers.


Also, the Afterpay acquisition comes amid Square's [move into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/). Square reported a $45 million impairment to operating income in the June quarter related to its Bitcoin investment.


"Afterpay's core BNPL capability will accelerate the development of Square's two-sided (merchant and consumer) network, helping to connect its Seller and Cash App ecosystems," Lisa Ellis, analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a report. "Within our payments coverage, the Square-Afterpay deal is most directly negative for PayPal, although it validates PayPal's strategy."


Under "buy now, pay later" plans, consumers generally split payments into three or four equal installments interest-free, and avoid transaction fees if they pay on time.


BofA's Kupferberg added: "This acquisition will introduce additional credit risk to SQ stock, as we estimate Afterpay had $965 million in loans on its balance sheet as of June 30, more than the $807 million in loans held for sale by Square."


For most BNPL transactions, consumers now use debit cards that deduct money from a checking account, analysts say. Merchants, though, pay BNPL companies a fixed fee as well as a small commission.


Square Stock: June-Quarter Revenue Misses
-----------------------------------------


Square earnings per share spiked 266% to 66 cents in the June quarter. Revenue surged 143% to $4.68 billion but missed estimates amid Bitcoin volatility. Analysts expected Square earnings per share of 30 cents on sales of $5.03 billion. The company had been scheduled to report second-quarter results on Thursday.


"CashApp's year-over-year revenue growth (87%) decelerated from the prior quarter's 139%, reflecting tough comparisons, with likely further deceleration during the next few quarters," Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said in a report.


Square stock ranks first in IBD's finance-credit card, payment processing industry group. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99.

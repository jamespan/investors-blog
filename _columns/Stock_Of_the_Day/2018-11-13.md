About Euronet Worldwide
-----------------------


The electronic payments provider, which sprung up in 1994, specializes in electronic financial transactions, prepaid services and money transfers. Despite its name, Euronet Worldwide is actually based in Leawood, Kan.


In 2017, the company processed 3.6 billion transactions across those three segments, representing $95 billion.


Revenue has consistently beat Wall Street estimates for at least the last seven quarters, and per-share profit tends to meet or beat views.


Analysts are looking for 10% revenue growth and a 12% increase in earnings per share in the current quarter. For the year, they project 13% revenue gains and 20% earnings growth.

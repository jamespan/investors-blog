**Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the coronavirus test player shrugged off a sales decline for some of its medical devices to top first-quarter expectations. In response, ABT stock broke out bullishly.




For the [first quarter](https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-04-16-Abbott-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results) ended March 31, Abbott earned 65 cents per share, minus some items, on $7.73 billion in sales. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 3.2% and sales edged up 2.5% on a strict as-reported basis. Organically, sales increased 4.3%.


Both metrics topped the average estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research, which called for Abbott earnings of 54 cents per share on $7.27 billion in sales.


Sales from Abbott's nutrition, diagnostics and established pharmaceuticals — the latter of which sells outside the U.S. only — beat expectations, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said in a report to clients. Overall medical devices sales also topped, though several key product lines saw declines.

"The late March impact in elective procedures resulted in declines — the surprise on the downside was (cardiac rhythm management), which declined (high single-digit), a tad worse than (our expectations)," he said. But Kumar kept his outperform rating on ABT stock.


ABT Stock Breaks Out On Earnings Beat
-------------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), ABT [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) jumped 5.7%, to 96.10, in heavy [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/). That helped ABT stock clear a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 92.55 out of a consolidation.


During the first quarter, the strongest growth by segment came from established pharmaceuticals. Sales charged ahead 9.3% organically to $1.04 billion. Nutrition also posted a strong quarter as revenue popped 7.3% to more than $1.9 billion.


Medical device sales rose 2.9% to $2.94 billion. International strength offset a decline from the U.S. Meanwhile, revenue from diagnostics was $1.83 billion, up 0.7%. There, U.S. sales proved to be more robust, helping offset a dip in international revenue.


All four segments topped expectations — a boon for ABT stock. But sales of some medical devices were shaky. Sales from electrophysiology, vascular, cardiac rhythm management and neuromodulation declined a respective 2.9%, 10.8%, 6.5% and 7.8%, Kumar said.



That's to be expected, however, amid the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) as many elective procedures are delayed. And, to Abbott's credit, sales from heart failure devices advanced 10.5%, Kumar said.


Coronavirus Test Could Add $1 Billion
-------------------------------------


Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans maintained her buy rating on ABT stock. She noted the solid first-quarter growth, but said the focus for most investors will remain on full-year results. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 outbreak, Abbott pulled its full-year outlook.


Abbott is a key player amid the pandemic, however. The medical outlet has launched a series of coronavirus tests. Two are diagnostics to determine current Covid-19 infection. The third can find antibodies associated with the virus to determine whether someone has previously been infected.


Notably, the company sells a five-minute point-of-care coronavirus test that will "potentially add over $1 billion to the company's diagnostics business," Evans said in her note to clients. Still, she predicted full-year medical device sales will remain challenged.


"Abbott's medical device segment will be most negatively impacted in 2020 as nonemergency hospital procedures decline," Evans said. "As a result, we have lowered our earnings per share estimate by roughly 13%."


Representatives of Abbott didn't immediately return a request for comment.


ABT Stock Is A Top Medical Player
---------------------------------


It's important to note that ABT stock is among the leaders in its industry group of diversified medical companies. Shares have a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. This means ABT stock ranks in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical growth metrics.


Shares also have a bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 92. The RS Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. The best performers tend to have RS Ratings of 80 before big price runs.

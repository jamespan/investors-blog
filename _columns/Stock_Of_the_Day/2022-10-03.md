**Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). It's one of several solar energy stocks that investors are piling into thanks to the recently approved Inflation Reduction Act, which authorized $369 billion in spending on green energy. ENPH stock is nearing a buy point.




If Enphase stock rises above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and 21-day line, it would clear a short, downward-sloping trend line and get above very short-term highs. That would create an early-entry buy point of 294.90, which is 10 cents above its Sept. 27 high of 294.80, based on [IBD analysis](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


Enphase stock climbed 3.3% to close at 286.61 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The Fremont, Calif.-based company is a leading provider of solar microinverters. Microinverters boost solar energy production, improve reliability in solar energy systems and support intelligent energy management.


Enphase also makes software to monitor energy generation and battery systems. The company focuses primarily on residential markets.

Enphase Boasts More Than 16,000 Installers

"As I have stated before, our strategy is to build best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our network of distributors and installers, enabled by our installer platforms," Enphase Chief Executive Badri Kothandaraman said on the company's earnings call with analysts. "We have certified more than 1,600 installers worldwide to date, and we are continuing to win around 15 new installers a week in the U.S."

**Grand Canyon Education** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the education services provider rallies near a buy point as former President Donald Trump appears to be the front-runner in the 2024 presidential election. LOPE shares angled higher Thursday.




At the end of the first quarter, Grand Canyon Education had more than 118,000 enrolled students. Meanwhile, Grand Canyon University (GCU), the largest Christian university in the U.S., pays about 60% of its tuition and fee revenue to Grand Canyon Education, or GCE, for services including marketing, recruitment and student counseling.


Grand Canyon Education stock rallied sharply after the [election of Donald Trump in November 2016](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/chegg-stock-gsx-techedu-earn-top-marks-amid-coronavirus-education-fallout/), which beckoned in the for-profit-friendly Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.


Since 2020, the company has also seen its annual profit grow 26% to $7.04 per share in 2023 while revenue has increased 14%. Analysts project annual EPS will gain another 20% by 2025, according to FactSet.


Biden Administration Cracks Down
--------------------------------


However, under President Joe Biden, Grand Canyon University and Grand Canyon Education have been sued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and fined $37.7 million by the Education Department for allegedly misleading students about costs and misrepresenting itself as a nonprofit institution.


In December 2023, the FTC filed suit vs. Grand Canyon Education, Grand Canyon University, and CEO Brian Mueller for "deceiving prospective doctoral students about the cost and course requirements of its doctoral programs and about being a nonprofit, while also engaging in deceptive and abusive telemarketing practices."


GCU and Mueller have appealed the Education Department fine and vehemently deny the allegations from federal regulators.


In April, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told the House Appropriations Committee that in regards to Grand Canyon University, the Biden administration is "cracking down not only to shut them down, but to send a message to not prey on students."

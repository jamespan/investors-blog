**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the information-technology services firm nears a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [narrow five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). Epam stock has gained more than 40% from a year ago.




The company specializes in custom software development and platform engineering services. Corporate customers hire its engineers for digital transformation projects. And the company hires most of its computer software developers in Eastern Europe, with most of its offshore centers in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Hungary.


William Blair analyst Maggie Nolan says Epam has focused on acquiring top engineering talent so it can command high pricing.


"The company prioritizes hiring high-quality engineers and consultants," Nolan wrote in a May 14 report to clients. "There is a tight labor market for what Epam considers 'the right talent' for the business."

With top engineers, Epam targets corporate digital transformation projects. More companies aim to turn paperwork into electronic records, automate business workflows and adopt [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) or cloud-computing technology.


Epam Customers Include Google
-----------------------------



Many of Epam's customers are in the financial services industry. Growth in that sector has slowed recently, including European banks. Epam has been targeting the life science, oil-and-gas and automotive industries.


One of its top clients is **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Google. Epam provides digital transformation services via Google's cloud computing business.


"Epam is well positioned to benefit from a significant funding uptick for digital-based projects with enterprises in the process of integrating front-end digital platforms with their back-end, legacy infrastructure, essentially, deeming Epam engineering expertise critical," Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said in a recent note to clients.


The company also has expanded into higher-margin consulting services through acquisitions.


Epam stock trades in much smaller volume than other info tech services firms such as **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)), as well as India outsourcing companies such as **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)).


Double-Digit Earnings Expected
------------------------------


For its second quarter ending in June, Epam earnings are expected to rise 21% to $1.22 a share, slowing from 26% growth in the year-earlier period. Epam revenue will grow 23% to $547.3 million, analysts estimate. In the June 2018 quarter, revenue climbed 28%.


Shares of Epam ventured out of a first-stage [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base on Jan. 16 with a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 134.88. It set off on a 33% run-up until the beginning of May. An investor could have also bought shares as it cleared the base's left-side high of 144.19. That produced a gain of 25%.


Shares then formed a [new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 180.65. Epam stock ticked up 0.2% to close Tuesday's session at 177.45.


Newtown, Pa.-based Epam has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). Relative strength compares a stock's price performance to that of the S&P 500. An [upward trending RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. And Epam's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been rising.


Epam Composite Rating Second To Only Globant
--------------------------------------------


After its run out of the [first-stage consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), Epam stock slipped just before its first-quarter earnings report issued on May 9. The company's earnings and revenue beat analyst estimates but guidance came in only slightly above Wall Street targets. Epam stock corrected 11% before advancing toward an entry point.


IBD's Computer-Tech Services group is [ranked No. 42 out of 197 industry](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-10-2019/) groups in terms of six-month relative price performance.


Epam has a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), part of the [IBD investment system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), looks at key technical and fundamental factors.


They include relative price performance as well as earnings and sales growth. Only **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) has a higher Composite Rating in the group.

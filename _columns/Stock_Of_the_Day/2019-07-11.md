**CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is one of the best-performing cybersecurity companies and is growing quarterly revenue at a consistent double-digit pace. CyberArk stock is up about 75% this year.




CyberArk's technology focuses on eliminating the most advanced cyberthreats, such as those that use insider privileges to attack the heart of an enterprise. The software focuses on protecting organizations from undetected cyberattacks that have made their way inside the network perimeter. It focuses on protecting the identities of privileged-account users.


For the past six weeks, CyberArk stock has been building a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a buy point of 138.83. It ended trading Thursday at 131.65, about 5% below that. The stock is in a tight pattern as it hovers close to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and currently trades above it.


The last time CyberArk reached a buy point was about six months ago, when it cleared a 12-week base in late January. The stock broke out past an 84.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) on Jan. 30 in higher-than-normal volume. From there, shares rallied 65% to their record high of 138.73 set on May 28. The stock then pulled back to kick off the formation of its current flat base. It's common for growth stocks to advance strongly, then pause and form a base before advancing again.

The company held its initial public offering in September 2014, pricing CyberArk stock at 16 each. CyberArk stock ticked down 0.4%, near 131.55, during afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


CyberArk Stock Rating
---------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows that CyberArk has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99 out of a best-possible 99, meaning the stock ranks among the elite in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 97, which also reflects strong [stock market performance](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


It has a stellar 97 [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1), which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth with all other stocks.


CyberArk currently holds the No. 1 ranking among its peers in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group. **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) is second, followed by **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)).


The software security group, which consists of 32 stocks, ranks No. 14 out of the 197 industry groups [tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-27-2018/).


But there are some negatives. Despite the powerful 99 EPS rating, CyberArk earnings this year are expected to slow. The consensus of Wall Street analysts is that, for 2019, CyberArk earnings per share should grow just 5%, a sharp slowdown from last year's 78% rise.


Another concern is CyberArk's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which compares a stock's price action with that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line says the stock is being passed up.


The RS line on CyberArk, which had been trending upward since February, began to descend on May 31.


Double-Digit Revenue Growth
---------------------------


[CyberArk earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/cyberark-earnings-cybr-stock-q12019/) for the first quarter beat analyst estimates, while company's guidance exceeded Wall Street targets.


Adjusted earnings jumped 75% to 56 cents a share. Revenue climbed 34% to $95.9 million. Revenue has grown at a quarterly double-digit rate for more than four years.


"I am confident that we have a significant runway for growth across both new and existing enterprise customers," CyberArk Chief Executive Udi Mokady said in the quarterly earnings conference call with Wall Street analysts.


Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an outperform rating and price target of 145 on CyberArk stock.


"We believe CyberArk is extremely well-positioned to further penetrate its installed base and expand its opportunity with new customers in this next-generation security market," Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.

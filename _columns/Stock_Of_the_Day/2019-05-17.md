Splunk plans to report results for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30 next Thursday. Wall Street expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share, vs. a seven-cent loss in the year-ago period. The consensus is for 27% revenue growth to $396 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Splunk soundly [beat Wall Street estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/splunk-earnings-splunk-stock-q4-2018/) in the fourth quarter. Last quarter, Splunk earnings growth accelerated to 41% year over year from 36% in the preceding quarter.


Risks In Buying Splunk Stock Before Earnings
--------------------------------------------


Buying a stock just ahead of earnings can be risky since you typically don't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the latest quarterly numbers come out. That means Splunk stock is a candidate for a bullish [earnings options trade](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/) to maximize potential gains while limiting losses.


A basic options trading strategy around earnings using call options allows you to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk.


Earlier in the week, Splunk stock rebounded from its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). Institutional investors often use the 50-day line as an area to add shares to positions in favored stocks.


The company consistently has reported double-digit revenue growth going back more than four years. Splunk revenue in 2018 jumped 38% from a year earlier to $1.8 billion. Adjusted earnings rose 39% to $1.33 per share.


Last year was a turning point for Splunk stock, which struggled for four years to climb its way back to the peak it hit in February 2014. It broke through that resistance in March 2018.

**Vanda Pharmaceuticals** ([VNDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNDA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) ahead of what Wall Street believes will be a fourth straight quarter of profitability.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), Vanda stock dipped 1.1% to 21.63, but received some support at its 50-day moving line. Meanwhile, [broad biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) also fell a fraction amid a broader correction.


The biotech makes drugs that treat a sleep disorder and schizophrenia. The firm's most important [drug is called Hetlioz](http://www.vandapharma.com/dev-hetlioz.html). It treats [non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/non-24/content/facts-prevalence), a chronic circadian rhythm disorder that occurs more frequently in blind patients.


[Circadian rhythm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1619000) is the body's natural clock for sleeping and waking. It's tied to daylight, so the blind population often has abnormalities. But Oppenheimer analyst Esther Rajavelu says there's still an opportunity for Hetlioz in sighted patients.

46% Prescribed Hetlioz
----------------------


In a recent survey of physicians, 46% had prescribed Hetlioz, Rajavelu said in a recent report. More than half of their Hetlioz patients are sighted. On average, respondents diagnosed 13% of sleep disorder patients with circadian rhythm disorders.


"Prescribers generally perceive Hetlioz as nonaddictive with a favorable safety/side-effect profile relative to other sleep agents, and may be broadly applicable to patients with sleep disturbances who are nonresponsive or partially responsive to other sleep therapies," she said.


All survey respondents said they planned to increase or maintain current prescribing habits for the sleep medicine, Rajavelu said.


Rajavelu models $116 million and $156 million in 2018 and 2019 Hetlioz sales, respectively, growing to $334 million by 2022. She expects blind patients in the U.S. will comprise about 70% of sales. In 2019, sighted patients could contribute 11% to Hetlioz revenue.


Catalysts Line Up For Vanda Stock
---------------------------------


Vanda is expected to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve Hetlioz as a jet-lag drug in the fourth quarter, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Charles Duncan said in a recent report.


Further, Vanda is testing a drug called tradipitant as a [treatment for gastroparesis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355787). Gastroparesis occurs when the stomach doesn't properly empty itself. Duncan expects Vanda to have Phase 2 data from that study in the fourth quarter.


Gastroparesis could be a "large market opportunity" with five million patients, he said.


The biotech licensed tradipitant from **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) in 2012. It's also looking at tradipitant as an [eczema treatment](http://www.vandapharma.com/dev-tradipitant.html). But Duncan has a neutral rating on Vanda stock due to a lack of visibility on its eczema efforts.


Another potential catalyst for Vanda stock lies in its [third-quarter earnings report](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=196233&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2372780), slated for Nov. 7. The consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research calls for Vanda to report adjusted earnings of 2 cents per share on $49 million in sales.


In the year-earlier period, [Vanda reported](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=196233&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2315068) adjusted losses of 3 cents a share on $41.34 million in sales. But Vanda has been profitable in the three quarters since.


Vanda Stock Ranks In Top 5%
---------------------------


Late last month, Vanda stock bullishly broke out of a cup with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 23.45. But Vanda stock has lost 6.8% from that entry point amid a broader correction. Over the same time, biotech stocks have collectively tumbled more than 13%.


But the signs remain bullish for Vanda. Despite its retreat from that buy point, its Relative Strength line has never been higher and now sits at 94. The stock appears to be forming another [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Vanda stock also has an Investor's Business Daily [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 95 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it ranks in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Very few biotech stocks can make that boast. Just eight out of more than 500 have a rating of 95 or higher.

**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm works on a new flat base and trades about 5% below a buy point.




Palo Alto stock shot up 8% on Feb. 27, emerging from a cup-shaped chart pattern, after reporting better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings. Palo Alto stock, though, pulled back. It's working on a new flat base, with an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 260.73. The two patterns combined can be considered a base-on-base formation, a proper type of chart pattern.


Palo Alto's fiscal third-quarter earnings are due May 29. The company primarily competes in the "firewall" network security market, facing off against **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and others. Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from the public internet  and monitor web-based apps.

While growth in the firewall market has slowed, Palo Alto has been gaining share. Under new Chief Executive Nikesh Arora, a former top executive at Alphabet-unit Google, Palo Alto aims to build a broader, [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-companies/)-based service platform.


Palo Alto Cortex Platform Could Boost Share Gains
-------------------------------------------------


Some analysts expect the newly launched "Cortex XDR" product to boost share gains.  Palo Alto rebranded its Application Framework, introduced in 2017, as Cortex.


The Cortex product analyzes firewall data as well as endpoint data. Endpoint protection software detects malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.


Cortex utilizes machine learning tools, a type of [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).


"While it's very early, we believe Palo Alto's new data-centric consumption model, Cortex, gives it a legitimate chance to further separate from its peers," Mizuho Securities analyst Gregg Moskowitz said in a March report to clients.


"In our view, Palo Alto possesses the strongest array of cloud assets among firewall vendors," he added.

------------------------


Palo Alto has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99 out of a possible 99. Its Relative Strength Rating is a solid 91.


The Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge the strengths of a company's stock.


The best stocks, meanwhile, tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/), meanwhile, compares a stock's price performance to that of the S&P 500.

Palo Alto has been making acquisitions. Early this year it bought Demisto for $560 million in cash and stock. In earlier deals, it bought Redlock for $173 million and Evident.io for $300 million.


CEO Arora has told analysts that a bigger "transformative"-type deal is not anticipated.

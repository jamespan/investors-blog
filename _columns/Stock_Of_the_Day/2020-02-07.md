**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as new data shows the chipmaker continues to gain market share in personal computers and servers. AMD stock rose on Friday.




A report this week from Mercury Research showed AMD made significant gains in market share for processors in desktop and notebook PCs and servers in the fourth quarter. Industry leader **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) lost ground in the December quarter, it said.


"We expect AMD to continue to gain share, and for its margins to expand as it does," Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a note to clients. "AMD's 2020 outlook seems conservative to us on both revenue and margins."


Lipacis reiterated his buy rating on AMD stock with a price target of 58. In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMD stock rose 0.8% to close at 49.73.

AMD Stock Bounces Off 10-Week Moving Average Line
-------------------------------------------------


AMD stock has been on a tear since it broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 35.65 on Nov. 4. That action happened four days after it reported [mixed third-quarter financial results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q3-2019-amd-stock/).


In early December, AMD stock formed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), which offered investors an extra buy point. It notched an all-time high of 52.81 on Jan. 24.


This week, AMD stock tested its [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and found support above it. Like the three-weeks-tight pattern, it is another buy area.


AMD Earnings Narrowly Top Fourth-Quarter Views
----------------------------------------------


On Jan. 28, Advanced Micro Devices narrowly beat Wall Street's targets for the [fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q4-2019-amd-stock/), but its first-quarter sales guidance missed views.


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted 32 cents a share on sales of $2.13 billion in the December quarter. Wall Street expected AMD earnings of 31 cents a share on sales of $2.11 billion. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings soared 300% while sales climbed 50%.


For the current quarter, AMD expects revenue of $1.8 billion, up 42% year over year. Wall Street was looking for sales of $1.86 billion in the March quarter.


For the full year, AMD forecasts revenue growth of 28% to 30%. The midpoint of that guidance translates to sales of $8.68 billion. Wall Street was targeting $8.58 billion


Analyst Day Next Possible Catalyst For AMD Stock
------------------------------------------------


AMD's analyst day on March 5 is the next possible catalyst for AMD stock, Lipacis said.


Shipments of central processing units, or CPUs, were strong in the fourth quarter, up 6% year over year, BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava said in his report to clients.


On a quarter-to-quarter basis, CPU shipments rose 5% in the fourth quarter. The normal seasonal pattern is for CPU shipments to decline 3% sequentially in the period, Srivastava said.


In the fourth quarter, AMD had 18.3% market share in desktop processors, up from 15.9% a year earlier. Its share of notebook processors was 16.2%, up from 12.2% a year earlier. Its share of the server market climbed to 4.5% from 3.1%.


AMD stock ranks No. 46 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks. It also is on IBD's highly selective [Leaderboard list](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) of stocks.

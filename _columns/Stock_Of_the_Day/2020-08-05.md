Mastercard stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the payment-processing giant hits buy range on hopes for more stimulus checks — and spending.




Consumers are starting to spend more as the economy reopens, while more stores and restaurants offer in-person services. **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) also benefits from new spending patterns, especially as people shy away from cash.


"Our platform uniquely positions us to support the shift to digital across consumer and business payments that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in consumers' preference for contactless payments," said CEO Ajay Banga in an earnings statement last week.


Plus, another stimulus check could be in the mail in the coming weeks for millions of Americans if Congress approves the new spending bill. On Wednesday, reports said House Democrats and Senate Republicans were getting closer to a deal.


A pullback in openings due to rising Covid-19 cases or increased layoffs could weigh heavily on spending and credit card providers. But infection rates in some key hot spots have started to come off highs recently.

Dexcom stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares weather the same coronavirus worries rattling other diabetes treatment outlets **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) and **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)).




As of Thursday's close, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) had lost roughly 3.4% for the week. Over the same time period, the Dow Jones has experienced several of its worst days on record. Shares of diabetes treatment stocks Tandem and Insulet declined 14.7% and 13.5%, respectively. Dexcom dipped another 2% on Friday.


The Street has remained bullish on Dexcom stock in the wake of the company's recent fourth-quarter earnings report. Guidance for 2020 appears conservative, Stephens analyst Chris Cooley said in a recent report to clients.


Dexcom's estimated user base for 2020 "yields a roughly $1.4 billion run rate, implying total user growth of about 35% to exceed the upper-bound of annual revenue guidance," Cooley said. He maintained his overweight rating on Dexcom stock, though he views it as volatile.

Dexcom Stock Weathers Correction
--------------------------------


Dexcom makes continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, for diabetes treatment. These body-worn devices help diabetics track their blood sugar levels. Its key competitors include giants such as [**Abbott Laboratories**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abt-stock-buy-now/) ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) and **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)).


CGMs can pair with insulin pumps from companies like Insulet, Tandem and Medtronic. The market for these devices is primarily Type 1 patients. Type 1 diabetes is genetic and patients don't produce the insulin necessary to control blood glucose. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition.


For the full year, [Dexcom guided](https://dexcom.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dexcom-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2019-financial) to $1.73 billion to $1.78 billion in sales, up 17%-20%. That would slow from 43% growth in 2019. Last year, sales were $1.48 billion.


But Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis expects Dexcom's sales to rise 24% in 2020. He sees an increase in patients accessing Dexcom devices through the pharmacy, greater penetration among patients with Type 2 diabetes and potential **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) coverage in April.


Further, he sees "returns on director-to-consumer investment efforts, which will ramp into the second half of 2020." Lewis had an equal-weight rating on Dexcom stock in a recent report.


Expanding Diabetes Treatment Patients
-------------------------------------


William Blair analyst Margaret Kaczor notes a growing number of Dexcom users. This comes as Dexcom has recently announced partnership deals with insulin pump companies Tandem and Insulet in diabetes treatment.


"As a result, we believe that the new users have proved to be sticky, while also leaving some room for the company to improve utilization in the coming years," she said in a report to clients.



Utilization of diabetes treatment devices continues to grow among Type 1 diabetics, Kaczor said. However, she notes Dexcom has had to make some concessions on price. Dexcom has said it will "become more offensive" in driving patient demand in 2020.


Further, intensively managed Type 2 diabetes is proving to be an important market, she said. In general, this group of patients still relies on finger sticks to check blood sugar and uses multiple daily injections of insulin.


"Management was more bullish on its developments in these opportunities than we have heard previously, highlighting more revenues to come in the next two to three years," she said. Kaczor kept her outperform rating on Dexcom stock.


Dexcom Stock Is Highly Rated
----------------------------


Chief Executive Kevin Sayer couldn't say why Dexcom shares are weathering the coronavirus storm better than its peers.


"What I can tell you is that at Dexcom, we always focus on our patients first," he told Investor's Business Daily in a written statement. "We have learned if we do everything we can meet their needs, Dexcom will continue to be successful regardless of market conditions."


He noted Dexcom's strategic plan involves delivering technology that allows patients to focus on their lives rather than their diabetes.


"As we execute this plan, we'll leave the investors to determine the value of our company," he said.


Dexcom stock is also highly rated according to IBD standards.


Shares of the diabetes treatment player lead their industry group with a perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99. The CR measures a stock's key growth metrics. This puts Dexcom stock in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical measures.


Dexcom stock also has a high [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 98. The RS Rating is a 1-99 measure of a stock's 12-month performance. So, Dexcom stock ranks in the top 2% of all stocks on that metric.


Other diabetes treatment stocks have suffered during the coronavirus correction. Insulet stock has a CR of 63 and an RS Rating of 95. Tandem shares now have a CR of 86 and an RS Rating of 83. Still both remain in the upper echelon of stocks with an RS Rating at 80 or above.

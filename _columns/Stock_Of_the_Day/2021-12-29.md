Chemical-maker **Huntsman** ([HUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Huntsman stock is breaking out of a base.




The stock is breaking out after the company — whose products go into everything from furniture padding and footwear to electronics and wind-energy equipment — said it would review a possible sale and other options for a textiles business and announced a new executive compensation plan.


A potential sale would mark the company's latest efforts to refine its focus, shore up margins and serve shareholders.


Huntsman Stock
--------------


Shares rose 4.4% to 35.13 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). The move put Huntsman stock above a 34.57 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). Volume was above average, increase given the generally subdued market trading at the end of the year.


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is at a consolidation high and a 52-week best. That indicates HUN stock is outperforming the S&P 500.


Huntsman stock has an 88 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 74.


The company over the years has tried to streamline its business and narrow its focus on a handful of segments. Since 2020, it has offloaded some businesses and properties in areas like India and Switzerland and sold shares of others, while also making new acquisitions.


When Huntsman reported third-quarter earnings in October, it said it had divested around 40% of its portfolio since 2017. Those divestments included "much of our commodity product lines, while adding numerous differentiated and higher margin products to the portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions."


"Despite pockets of disruption in our supply chain and cost inflation, we see strong pent-up demand across most of our businesses with favorable pricing dynamics," the company said in its earnings release at that time.


Huntsman's biggest segment, as of its third quarter, was its polyurethanes business. Its polyurethane chemicals are used to make foams, coatings and adhesives, and are used for insulation and cushioning. That business has customers in more than 90 countries. It has production facilities in the U.S., China and Netherlands.

'Best Interests' For Huntsman Stock Owners
------------------------------------------


Huntsman on Tuesday said a review of its Singapore-based Textile Effects division, which includes dyes and other treatments for different types of fabrics, would serve shareholder interests. That business, as of the third quarter, was the smallest, as measured by sales.


"We have been transparent about our continued evaluation of divestment opportunities that are both in line with our strategic goals and in the best interests of our shareholders," CEO Peter Huntsman said in a statement on Tuesday.


He added that the company believed "now is the right time to explore options for Textile Effects. We expect that the division will generate close to $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2021, recovering much of what was lost due to Covid-19."


The company also says its board has authorized management to start a multiyear compensation plan for officers and vice presidents. It said most of the stock incentives "will be performance-based and tied to relative total shareholder return and free cash flow measures."


Huntsman also says its cash bonus program will be tied to targets outlined at its Investor Day in November.


At that time, management targeted 2022 adjusted EBITDA of around $1.4 billion and free cash flow conversion above 40%. It also outlined plans for savings, investing in high-margin projects and new stock buybacks of $1 billion over three years.

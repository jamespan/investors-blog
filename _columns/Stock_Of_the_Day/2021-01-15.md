**Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares of RGEN stock are lingering in a buy zone after busting out of a cup base on Thursday.




The company is a partner in the drug-development process. Importantly, Repligen is getting into the Covid-19 vaccines game. Repligen makes a key substance, needed to purify coronavirus vaccines, under a partnership with Navigo Protein GmbH. Repligen expects that product to be commercially available in 2021.


The company declined to comment on the stock movement, but noted the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference shined a light on the bioprocessing industry. Chief Executive Tony Hunt gave a presentation at the conference on Wednesday. The event is a "kickoff" for the health care industry, he said.

"Our overall industry continues to experience tailwinds from Covid-19 related demand," he said in an email to Investor's Business Daily. "These Covid-related tailwinds are incremental to an already robust biologics market that includes monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, cell and gene therapies and vaccines."


Shares of RGEN stock broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 212.65 on Thursday, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), RGEN stock gained 1.5% to close at 215.47.


RGEN Stock: Growing Its Pipeline
--------------------------------


On Wednesday, during a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Repligen Chief Executive Tony Hunt reiterated the company's outlook for $350 million in 2020 sales, at the midpoint.


That stands in line with the average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet. Analysts also expect Repligen to earn $1.44 per share, minus some items. On a year-over-year basis, sales and earnings would pop 30% and 35%, respectively.


Repligen is also growing its pipeline, Hunt said during the conference. Four to five years ago, the company would talk about its focus on monoclonal antibodies. Now, it's moving into gene therapy and has deepened its focus on vaccines due to the pandemic.


"We expect main drivers to be the impact of Covid-related tailwinds, continued strength in gene therapy and full-year impact from (mergers) and new product launches," Hunt said in an email. "Overall, we expect Covid-19 related tailwinds to continue through 2021."


Four Key Areas Of Focus
-----------------------


Repligen sets itself up into four focus areas: filtration, chromatography, proteins and analytics, Hunt said. Its products assist companies that make biologic drugs. Repligen aims to improve the yield, reduce cost or waste, offer convenience or help save time.



Today, of its total addressable markets, Repligen estimates it has about 5% of the process analytics market and roughly 10% of the filtration market, according to the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference presentation. It owns bigger chunks of the proteins and chromatography markets — 10%-15% and 15%-20%, respectively.


Last year, the bioprocessing market was worth more than $12 billion, the J.P. Morgan presentation said. It sees that market growing at a 9%-12% compound annual rate through 2027.


Repligen's goal is to address challenges facing biologic drug developers.


Coronavirus vaccines also drive additional demand. In 2020, Covid-19-related sales accounted for 10% of revenue and 40%-50% of order growth. This year, the company calls for $50 million to $70 million in Covid-19-related revenue.


"This is how we compete," Hunt said, noting the growing pipeline.


RGEN Stock Is On A Run
----------------------


That has stoked RGEN stock. In 2020, shares soared more than 107%. RGEN stock easily outperformed its industry group of Medical Products peers. The group as a whole popped north of 30% in 2020.


So far this year, RGEN stock has added another nearly 12%. The industry group has risen a slightly less bullish 6.1%. The group itself ranks No. 105 out of 197 industry groups that Investor's Business Daily tracks.


More bullishly, RGEN stock leads the industry group. Shares have a Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) is a measure of a stock's fundamental and technical growth metrics. This puts RGEN stock in the top 2% of all stocks.


Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 84. This puts RGEN stock in the top 16% of all stocks in terms of its 12-month performance.

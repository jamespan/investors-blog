**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the internet television network benefits from entertaining shut-ins during the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. Netflix stock is approaching a fresh buy point.




Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix posted a huge subscriber gain in the March quarter after governments shut movie theaters and sports and live entertainment venues to slow the spread of Covid-19. Consumers stayed at home and were entertained increasingly by streaming video services and video games.


Netflix added 15.77 million new subscribers in the [first quarter](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/netflix-earnings-q1-2020-nflx-stock/), crushing views for about 8 million. It ended the quarter with 182.86 million subscribers worldwide.


For the second quarter, Netflix expects to add 7.5 million new subscribers as home quarantines continue.

Netflix Stock Just Below All-Time High
--------------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Netflix stock rose 1.5% to close at 438.27. Earlier in the session, it was up as much as 3.5% to 447 during a rough day for the overall market.


Netflix stock is nearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 449.62 from a short [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-successful-investing/) above its prior [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Technically, the new buy point would be an add-on entry point, a chance to add shares to an existing position in the stock. But investors could start a small position here as well, according to [IBD investing principles](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


A pause in the stock market rally or a pullback could offer more time for Netflix stock to form a traditional consolidation.


On April 13, Netflix stock broke out of a six-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at a buy point of 393.62, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The chart also could be interpreted as a cup with handle with a 383.11 buy point. It snapped back from a 26% correction during the coronavirus-fueled market sell-off. Netflix stock raced to an all-time high of 449.52 on April 16, three trading days before its first-quarter earnings report.



Internet TV Services Hurting Traditional Pay TV
-----------------------------------------------


On Tuesday, Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak reiterated his buy rating on Netflix stock with a price target of 580. In a note to clients, he said the outlook for Netflix is "attractive" while the forecast is "awful" for traditional pay-TV operators.


"While trends have been ugly in pay TV (about 20 straight quarters of accelerating year-over-year declines), they continue to get worse on the launch of powerful new direct-to-consumer platforms led by Disney+," he said. Launched in November, **Walt Disney**'s ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) Disney+ had 54.5 million subscribers as of May 4.


Pay-TV subscribers have been "cord cutting," abandoning conventional TV programming for video-on-demand services like Netflix and Disney+, Wlodarczak said.


Netflix Content Pipeline Secure Into 2021
-----------------------------------------


While broadcast and cable TV networks are facing a shortage of programming later this year because of production shutdowns related to Covid-19, Netflix has a stockpile of new content that will last into next year.


"Its pipeline of new original content is secure well into 2021," Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in a note to clients Wednesday. "This is primarily a result of Netflix's 'straight-to-series' production approach, which creates a significantly longer lead time between the completion of principal photography, vs. when the show is ready to air. Which in this circumstance, turns out to be a huge benefit, as post-production can be accomplished remotely."


Juenger rates Netflix stock as outperform with a price target of 504.


Netflix's hit original content recently has included shows such as "Dead To Me," "Love Is Blind," "Outer Banks" and "Ozark."


Netflix stock ranks fourth on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks. It's also on IBD's prestigious [Leaderboard watchlist](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).

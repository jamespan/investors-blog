Better-Than-Expected Earnings
-----------------------------


On May 5, KLA reported better-than-expected quarterly results.


The Milpitas, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $2.47 a share on sales of $1.42 billion in its [fiscal third quarter](http://ir.kla-tencor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kla-corporation-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results) ended March 31. Wall Street had predicted earnings of $2.28 a share on sales of $1.39 billion. On a year-over-year basis, KLA earnings rose 37% while sales climbed 30%.


Semiconductor equipment stocks are seeing improving demand as the chip sector emerges from cyclical downturn. But a possible [coronavirus-driven recession](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) and [escalating U.S.-China trade tensions](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-equipment-stocks-rough-ride/) have tempered expectations for the group.


Meanwhile, two major new chip factories offer an opportunity for KLA to sell more gear. Earlier this month, **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) said it plans to build a [new factory in Arizona](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/taiwan-semiconductor-announces-new-us-chip-factory/). Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics plans to build a new cutting-edge [chip fabrication plant in South Korea](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-expands-its-foundry-capacity-with-a-new-production-line-in-pyeongtaek-korea).

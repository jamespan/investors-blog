IPO stock **Yeti Holdings** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) broke out to a buy zone Tuesday on bullish analyst comments on digital sales, making it [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Yeti stock is a leader in the lagging leisure products group.




Yeti IPO Stock Already Profitable
---------------------------------


The Yeti IPO debuted last October as a profitable company, unlike many new IPO stocks. While household names such as **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) and **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) continue to hunt for profits, Yeti earnings surged 700% in the March quarter, driven by direct-to-consumer sales.


Texas-based Yeti Holdings designs and markets coolers and other products for the growing outdoor and recreation market. Its premium offerings fueled a craze despite hefty price tags.


The company sells its signature Tundra coolers for as much as $1,300. These are coolers for "the serious outdoor enthusiast rather than for the mass-discount retailers," the company says.


The cooler lineup includes more affordable options such as the Roadie 20, which costs $200. Yeti also sells drinkware, bags and other accessories.


Drinkware sales grew 20% to $91 million in the first quarter. Coolers and equipment sales increased 11% to $59.7 million. Direct-to-consumer ("DTC") sales rose 28% over the same period and wholesale sales increased 8%.

Yeti Stock Gets Price Target Hike
---------------------------------


Analysts are bullish on Yeti stock ahead of the Q2 earnings report, due early Aug. 1. Ten out of 11 brokerage firms covering the stock maintain a buy rating or higher on the stock, one has a hold, and none has a sell or lower, according to Zacks Investment Research.


On Tuesday, Cowen analysts raised Yeti stock price target to 37 from 35, saying the company's "most conservative" sales guidance could move higher. They rate Yeti stock at outperform.


"A key part to the bull narrative is continued growth in the DTC channel without margin deterioration," they wrote. The analysts see potential acceleration in the second half when Yeti launches "category expansion and innovation," including a new Hopper soft cooler and lunch bag, as well as new colorways for existing products.


Meanwhile, Notable growth stock investor Mark Minervini tweeted that he placed Yeti stock on his "Buy Alert" list.

Yeti earnings per share have easily beaten estimates in the prior three quarters. But Yeti earnings growth is set to slow sharply as year-over-year comparisons get much tougher.


Second-quarter results are due Aug. 1. Yet earnings per share should rise 7% to 30 cents as sales climb 9% to $224 million, analysts say.


Analysts expect Yeti earnings to rise 17% for all of 2019 and 23% in 2020.


IBD Stock Of The Day Breaks Out
-------------------------------


Shares surged 12% to 36.26 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), clearing a 34.37 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) buy point. Yeti stock volume is heavy.


Although the base was relatively deep at 37%, the cup pattern shape was proper. The three down weeks in the left side of the base that saw heavy volume are a bit of a concern.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) for Yeti stock jumped right to record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the chart above, tracks performance against the S&P 500. Yeti stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 87, with its strong earnings performance reflected in its EPS Rating of 98.


One concern for investors is the upcoming Yeti earnings report. There's just one weak for Yeti stock to build a cushion from its buy point, assuming it doesn't simply stay in place or reverse lower.


Yeti stock debuted at 18 last year and quickly formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) with a 17.55 entry. The stock cleared that buy point Nov. 19 and peaked at 36.60 in April before starting its current consolidation.


Yeti Stock Is Group Leader
--------------------------


Among 18 names in the leisure products industry group, Yeti stock is ranked No. 3. Heavyweights in this group include **Harley-Davidson** ([HOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOG)) and **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)). Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson and ATV and motorcycle maker Polaris both reported earnings Tuesday morning. Harley-Davidson stock and Polaris stock rose Tuesday, but are in long downtrends.


But top-ranked stocks in the group are **Fox Factory** ([FOXF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXF)) at No. 1 and **Clarus** ([CLAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLAR)) at No. 2.

**Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)), a service provider in the electric power sector, is the IBD Stock Of The Day after lawmakers reached a deal on infrastructure spending. PWR stock broke out into buy range.




Quanta builds and maintains generating stations, substations, transmission lines and distribution lines nationwide. The company stands to benefit from increased spending by federal and local governments seeking to upgrade the nation's aging power grids.


On Aug. 24, the House announced it would vote on a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill on Sept. 27. The legislation includes $65 billion to rebuild the electric grid. The funds would go to build thousands of miles of new power lines and expand renewable energy. It also includes $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging stations.


The bill has already cleared the Senate, and a House vote on a separate budget framework defused a legislative threat to the infrastructure package.

Quanta Earnings
---------------


On Aug. 5, the Houston-based company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.06 a share, a 43% jump from a year ago. Sales climbed 20% year over year to $3 billion.


"Electrical sales momentum continues to reflect emphasis by utilities in infrastructure upgrades/servicing and larger transmission projects, EV charging infrastructure and renewable generation projects," said D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman in an Aug. 6 note to clients.


Additionally, Quanta's total backlog in Q2 was $17 billion, a 22% surge from the same period last year.


CEO Earl Austin said in an earnings call that Quanta's electric power backlog continues to increase, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities.


"As an example, one of our largest electric customers in the western United States recently announced a major new multiyear program to underground approximately 10,000 miles of electric distribution, power lines in high fire threat districts in the utility's service territory," he said.


Governments and utilities are racing to mitigate the risk of wildfires, which cost billions of dollars and killed dozens of people in the 2020 fire season in the Western U.S. As a result, analyst Theilman expects demand for Quanta's services to keep growing into 2022.

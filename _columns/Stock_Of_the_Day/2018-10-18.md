**Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the company's relative strength gains amid continued pressure on technology stocks. Analysts expect Ciena stock to get an earnings boost from the settlement of 2018 convertible debt as well as a share repurchase program.




The relative strength on Ciena stock has improved to 93. IBD's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-generating-improved-relative-strength-tripadvisor-2/) tracks stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Shares in the maker of fiber-optic communications systems edged up 0.7% to close at 30.98 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).


Ciena stock in September formed a bullish [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) following a beat-and-raise report for the fiscal third quarter that sent shares surging on Aug. 30.

A rising relative strength line is sending a bullish signal. Ciena stock is still 4% or so below a technical buy point of 32.33 as it consolidates in a flat base.


Ciena Stock Buyback
-------------------


The optical gear maker has an ongoing $300 million stock buyback that will reduce outstanding shares. That should be a plus for earnings growth.


Then, there's possible upside from a cash settlement on convertible debt. Ciena last year exchanged most of its 2018 convertible notes for new notes with an embedded cash settlement option.


Investors normally convert debt to equity. Ciena's cash option, though, would result in less earnings dilution in fiscal 2018 while also reducing interest expenses.


Hanover, Md.-based Ciena makes system-level optical products for communications networks and data centers.


Cloud Data Center Growth Key
----------------------------


Ciena's main customers have been telecom firms such as **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)). AT&T and Verizon accounted for 23% of sales during the third quarter. Ciena seems to be picking up business at another telecom, **CenturyLink** ([CTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTL)), analysts say.


The fiber-optic gear maker has targeted the data-center market. Ciena's WaveServer optical box targets the data-center-interconnect market. Internet firms are upgrading cloud data centers to speed up communications.


Ciena competes with **Infinera** ([INFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFN)) as well as **Acacia Communication** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)).


"Revenue growth is coming from the cloud," said a UBS report published on Oct. 2. "The open debate is around whether the company can hold on to cloud market share (now 40%). We see motivated competitors willing to drop price to take share come January 2019."

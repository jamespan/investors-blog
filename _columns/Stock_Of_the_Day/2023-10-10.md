Uber is Tuesday's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the ride-hail and delivery company's shares continue to show strength. Uber stock is in a flat base and nearing a 49.49 buy point, with a bounce from its 50-day line offering a potential early entry point, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).




Further, Uber stock is showing a bullish "Blue Dot" signal in its performance compared to other stocks.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Uber stock rose 2.6% to close at $46.63. The San Francisco, Calif.-based company's shares [have gained](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/uber-stock-profit-milestone-fast-lane/) 84% on the year coming into trading Tuesday.


Buyback Talk
------------


Uber's rise this year comes after a 41% fall in 2022. This year, the company has cut costs while improving the performance of its core ride-hailing and delivery businesses.


The company in August reported its [first-ever quarter](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/uber-stock-profit-milestone-fast-lane/) with an operating profit. Now, Uber is considering buying back some stock.


"We are now entering a phase where we are increasingly thinking about returning the capital to shareholders, either through dividends or buybacks, more likely with buybacks," Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology conference on Sept. 7.


Uber Stock: New CFO
-------------------


Also notable for Uber stock: The company is bringing on a [new chief financial officer](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uber-stock-ride-hail-company-names-new-cfo-launches-ai-products/). Uber announced Sep. 27 that Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, chief financial officer of semiconductor company **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), will take over the same role at Uber on Nov. 13.


The hire got positive reviews from Uber stock analysts.


"When Mahendra-Rajah was at ADI, the company was a consistent capital returner, and we understand that Mahendra-Rajah answered questions directly," UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a recent note to clients. "Investors like him and see him as a straight shooter."


Mahendra-Rajah takes over the job from Nelson Chai. Khosrowshahi announced on the company's earnings call in August that Chai planned to leave.


Further, Khosrowshahi credited Chai, who joined the company in 2018, with helping Uber achieve its first-ever quarterly operating profit.


Uber Turns Profit
-----------------


Uber went from red to black during the second quarter, as announced in its Aug. 1 earnings report. Uber posted a net profit of $394 million for the period that ended June 30 compared to a loss of $2.6 billion a year earlier. That was driven by a first-ever profit from its operations of $326 million.


Uber had posted a quarterly net profit before, but that was thanks to equity investment gains or re-evaluations, rather than from its ride-hailing and food-delivery operations.


Meanwhile, the company's revenue climbed 14% to $9.23 billion. But that came in under analyst expectations of $9.34 billion, according to FactSet. Uber's gross bookings grew 16% to $33.6 billion, ahead of analyst views for $33.49 billion.


Something to watch: Uber has recorded five consecutive quarters of decelerating revenue growth. However, that is driven in part by more difficult comparisons. The company is getting further out from quarters where the pandemic suppressed ride-hail demand.


Still, Uber stock was dinged in trading the day following earnings because of the revenue miss. But analysts remain bullish on Uber. About 94% of the 47 analysts covering the company hold a buy or overweight rating on the stock, according to FactSet.

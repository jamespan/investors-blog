Netflix Smashes Fourth-Quarter Subscriber Goal
----------------------------------------------


Late Tuesday, the internet television network reported adding 8.51 million new streaming subscribers in the [fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-q4-2020-netflix-earnings/), topping Wall Street's estimate of 6.5 million. However, its financial results were mixed. But analysts keyed in on the company's forecasts.


Netflix officials said the company is now generating enough cash to fund its growth strategy internally and no longer needs to borrow money.


Netflix ended 2020 with 203.7 million subscribers worldwide, including 73.9 million in the U.S. and Canada. It added 860,000 new subscribers in the U.S. and Canada in the December quarter, despite implementing a price hike.


Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Netflix isn't done growing in its home market.


"If you take the U.S. being our most penetrated market, we're still under 10% of television viewing time as Netflix," he said on a conference call Tuesday. "We've got a lot of subscribers here in the U.S., but we still have a lot more viewing time that we would like to earn."


For the current quarter, Netflix expects to add 6 million new subscribers worldwide. That was below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 8.6 million.


Nearing Positive Free Cash Flow
-------------------------------


The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company anticipates 2021 free cash flow at break-even, an improvement from its earlier forecast, which was minus $1 billion to break-even.


"We're super proud of where we are from a free-cash-flow perspective," Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on the earnings call. "The ability to self-fund our growth going forward (is a) pretty big milestone for us."


Neumann said the company will consider doing Netflix stock buybacks, but he didn't give a time frame. He said Netflix expects to have a positive cash flow starting in 2022.


In a letter to shareholders, Netflix detailed its improved finances. The company's operating profit margin was 18% in 2020, up five percentage points over 2019. It's targeting a 20% operating margin in 2021, which is one point higher than its previous forecast.


Netflix Stock Gets Flurry Of Price-Target Hikes
-----------------------------------------------


At least 20 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on Netflix stock following the earnings report. Two investment banks turned positive on Netflix stock. UBS and Wells Fargo upgraded their ratings on Netflix to buy from neutral.


"We've gone from a historical bear on NFLX to a card-carrying bull," Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in a note to clients. In addition to upgrading Netflix stock to buy, he raised his price target to 700 from 510.


Jefferies analyst Alex Giaimo reiterated his buy rating on Netflix stock and upped his price target to 650 from 610.


"While the Q4 subscriber beat will garner most of the attention, we believe the improved free-cash-flow commentary and future capital independence is the more important positive take-away," Giaimo said in a note to clients.


Growing Despite Heightened Competition
--------------------------------------


The Netflix bear argument about rising competition hindering Netflix's long-term success is "overblown," Giaimo said.


"Some competitors will succeed, some won't, but the big picture is that there will be multiple winners within the OTT (over-the-top TV) streaming space, and we expect Netflix to remain at the top of the food chain," he said.


Rivals include Amazon Prime Video from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Disney+ from **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and HBO Max from **AT&T**'s ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) WarnerMedia. Other competitors are Peacock from **Comcast**'s ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) NBCUniversal and Apple TV+ from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

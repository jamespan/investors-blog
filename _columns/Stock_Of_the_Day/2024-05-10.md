TSM Stock Breaks Out After Report
---------------------------------


In morning trades on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), TSM stock broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 148.43, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts. It climbed as high as 150.50 in intraday trading. TSM stock rose 4.5% to close at 149.26. The buy range goes to 155.85.


The TSMC sales report provided a lift for its customers. Among those fabless chipmakers rising on the news were Nvidia, Qualcomm and Broadcom.


Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said the April sales data puts TSMC on pace to beat consensus estimates for the second quarter. He reiterated his outperform, or buy, rating on TSM stock.


"We would attribute the better-than-forecast results to multiple tailwinds," Bryson said in a client note. Those tailwinds include strong demand for high-performance computing and artificial intelligence chips. TSMC also is seeing a pickup in standard server chips and stable demand for Apple iPhone chips, he said.


On April 18, Taiwan Semiconductor beat expectations for the [first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-q1-2024-earnings/) but offered cautious guidance. TSM stock fell 4.9% on the news that day.

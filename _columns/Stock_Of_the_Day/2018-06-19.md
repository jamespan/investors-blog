**Orbotech** ([ORBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORBK)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chip equipment maker holds up in a cup-with-handle pattern amid the broader stock market sell-off.




Orbotech stock slid 1.05% to 62.86 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), a mild decline compared with many of its chip equipment peers. **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) sank 2.3% Tuesday, while **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) retreated 2%. Both continue to tumble from recent breakouts. And chip giantÂ **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) fell 0.5%, off session lows, but after breaching its 50-day line in heavy volume on Monday.


Stock Of The Day: Orbotech
--------------------------


Not only is Orbotech stock holding up vs. top names in its industry group and sector, but it's also holding up within a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), which is really a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). After nearly setting an all-time high on June 5, shares have pulled back to create a handle. Orbotech is now trading 4% below the 65.73 buy point.


But there's a flaw in the [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/): heavy volume. During a handle-forming pullback, it's ideal to see those declines come in light volume. While the losses occurred in above-average trade, Orbotech's recent down days have been muted on a percentage basis vs. ASML and Entegris.

CLOSE




ASML stock staged a breakout over a 216.10 buy point on June 14 but is now trading about 6% below that level after several gap-downs. And Entegris is trading 5% below a 38.35 buy point initially cleared in intraday trade on June 7.


Intel stock has fallen about 9% from its June 4 high, undercutting a 53.88 buy point from a messy [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/).


Keep An Eye On Orbotech's RS Line
---------------------------------


Orbotech's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is off highs amid the creation of the handle. If Orbotech is truly holding up amid the broader market losses, see if the relative strength line starts to trend higher. The relative strength line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500, so a move higher would indicate outperformance amid the current widespread declines.


Also look for the RS line to hit new high ground if the stock breaks out, which would be a bullish indicator.


Strong Fundamentals
-------------------


IBD Stock of the Day Orbotech boasts [strong fundamentals](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-orbotech-ltd-orbk.aspx). In the chip equipment maker's most recent quarterly report, earnings growth accelerated to 80% from 24% sequentially, while sales growth accelerated to 34% from 19%. A pickup in top- and bottom-line growth is a signal of strength.


And the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which takes into account a variety of fundamental and technical metrics, is a 93 out of 99. Top stocks typically have high Composite Ratings as they launch big runs.

**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker approaches a buy point ahead of its first-quarter earnings report. AMD stock rose on Wednesday.




The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has been a top performer lately in the semiconductor sector because its chips are used in key growth markets.


Its server chips help run cloud-computing data centers, which are critical during the work-from-home trend sparked by the coronavirus crisis. Its PC and graphics chips are in demand for personal computers and gaming consoles, which have gotten a lift from consumers stuck at home during the coronavirus  pandemic.


AMD plans to release its first-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday. Wall Street expects the chipmaker to earn 18 cents a share on sales of $1.78 billion in the March quarter. In the year-earlier period, AMD earned 6 cents a share on sales of $1.27 billion.

On April 14, AMD launched [three new second-generation Epyc server chips](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-04-14-new-2nd-gen-amd-epyc-processors-redefine-performance-for-database) optimized for modern data centers. **Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)), **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)) and Lenovo are among vendors using the new server chips.

AMAT Stock Gets Post-Earnings Lift
----------------------------------


AMAT stock has been on the rise since the company blew past Wall Street's targets with its [fiscal third-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amat-stock-applied-materials-blows-past-quarterly-targets/) and guidance on Aug. 19.


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $1.90 a share on sales of $6.2 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 1. Analysts expected earnings of $1.77 a share on sales of $5.94 billion, according to FactSet. On a year-over-year basis, Applied Materials earnings rose 79% while sales climbed 41%.


For the current quarter, Applied Materials forecasts adjusted earnings of $1.94 a share, up 55%, on sales of $6.33 billion, up 35%. That's based on the midpoint of its outlook. Wall Street had predicted earnings of $1.81 a share on sales of $6.04 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.


Semiconductor equipment vendors are benefiting as chipmakers purchase gear to add capacity during the current chip shortage. Chipmakers also are ramping up orders of advanced equipment to make next-generation chips.


In addition to AMAT stock, other semiconductor equipment stocks at or near buy points include **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)).


Wall Street Analysts Debate Stock
---------------------------------


On Monday, Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho reiterated his buy rating on AMAT stock.


He noted that Applied Materials continues to see strength in its business in the second half of calendar 2021. The company believes its foundry/logic and DRAM chip gear sales will grow in the second half of the year vs. the first half. Meanwhile, its Nand chip gear sales will be flat to slightly down in the second half.


However,Â Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini on Tuesday downgraded AMAT stock to neutral from positive on valuation.


After the company's last beat-and-raise earnings report "all the good news (is) already dialed in," he said in a note to clients.


Applied Materials ranks eighth out of 32 stocks in IBD's semiconductor equipment industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-applied-materials-inc-amat.aspx). AMAT stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96 out of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks, regardless of industry group.

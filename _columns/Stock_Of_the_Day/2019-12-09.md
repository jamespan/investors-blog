Analysts Mixed On IBD Stock Of The Day
--------------------------------------


CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky rates Dick's Sporting Goods stock as a buy with a 50 price target. She pointed to the firm's "stellar" 6% comps increase in the latest quarter, the strongest since 2013. She also believes CEO Edward Stack's decision that the chain would stop selling hunting gear and guns from about 125 stores nationwide has actually been a positive.


"We attribute gains in part to Ed Stack's venture into social activism, which we see bolstering brand loyalty and creating long-term goodwill," Yanushevsky said in a Nov. 26 research note. "We also like steps DKS has taken to transform to a higher-margin business with growth of private labels and phasing of hunt in place of faster-growing merchandise categories, alongside bold experiential offerings."


However Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia is neutral with a 44 target on Dick's Sporting Goods stock.


"Management continues to point to further investments to drive the business into FY20, limiting opportunity for operating margin expansion the market is likely now expecting, and the company also faces a difficult 2H20 comparison," he said in a Nov. 26 note to clients.

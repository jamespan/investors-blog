Chipotle stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Thursday as it clears a trendline and extends a bounce from key support. Meanwhile, shareholders on Thursday are expected to approve a 50-for-1 stock split.




**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) shareholders greenlit a 50-for-1 stock split at Thursday's annual meeting. The board of directors originally [announced the plan on March 19](https://ir.chipotle.com/2024-03-19-CHIPOTLE-BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS-APPROVES-50-FOR-1-STOCK-SPLIT) following its approval.


CMG holders as of June 18 will receive 49 additional shares of Chipotle stock after market close on June 25. Chipotle stock will begin trading at a post-split basis on June 26.


It will be Chipotle's first stock split in its 30-year history and one of the biggest splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE's last 50-for-1 stock split was Berkshire Hathaway's all the way back in 2010, MarketWatch reported. Previously, Nasdaq-listed **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) completed a 20-for-1 split on June 6, 2022.


[Stock splits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-splits-nvidia-amazon-stock-splits-benefit-or-hurt-a-stock/) spread the market value of a company across a greater number of shares, which results in a lower price point for the stock. The total market capitalization of the company remains unchanged after a stock split, but liquidity increases due to the issuance of more shares. A lower share price does make it easier to trade options.


Chipotle Earnings, Outlook
--------------------------


Meanwhile, Chipotle will release second-quarter results on July 24, about a month after the split.


FactSet analysts expect earnings growth to slow slightly after accelerating the last two quarters, with a 23% increase to $15.61 per share. Wall Street estimates sales jump 16% to $2.93 billion.


[Chipotle on April 24](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-cmg-stock-buy-points/) cleared Wall Street estimates with a 27% earnings gain while revenue rose 14% to edge out forecasts. Comparable restaurant sales rose 7% during the quarter, driven by a 5.4% increase in transactions. The same-store sales growth beat estimates for a 5.4% increase.


Chipotle guided 2024 comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range, up from its February outlook of mid-single-digit growth. The company says it expects to open 285 to 310 new restaurants during the year, of which over 80% will have a Chipotlane drive-thru.


For the year, FactSet predicts Chipotle earnings to increase 24% to $55.69 per share on 15% sales growth to $11.36 billion.


Chipotle Stock Performance
--------------------------



CMG stock cleared a short [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) Thursday as it continues to bounce off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and 10-week line, [MarketSurge charts](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) show. The pullback to test the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) brought Chipotle stock almost to the top of a prior short consolidation, which wasn't quite long enough for a flat base.


CMG stock is on track to form a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 3,260 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after this week.

CMG shares have rallied nearly 40% this year as restaurant stocks leapt.


**Cava Group** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) stock doubled in 2024, with the fast-casual chain hitting a record high of 96.93 on May 30 following earnings. Cava, sometimes called the "Mediterranean Chipotle," fell nearly 7% Thursday amid some big insider sales.


**Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) is also trading near all-time highs after soaring more than 50% in 2024. ING stock sank x% after flashing a buy signal Wednesday.


**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) is extended above a flat-base buy zone and advanced nearly 39% this year.

Both TXRH and EAT fell slightly on Thursday.

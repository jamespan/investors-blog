**Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the online provider of pet food and products on Wednesday broadly expanded a telehealth service that provides continuous veterinarian care during the pandemic. Chewy stock managed strong gains on the news as the market tanked.




The telehealth service — which expanded from two states to more than 35 states — is called "[Connect With A Vet](https://www.chewy.com/app/content/connect-with-a-vet)." Users of the service can log on to their Chewy account to express concerns about their pet. Chewy will connect them with a licensed veterinarian online.


The service currently is available exclusively and free of charge to customers who subscribe to the company's Autoship program, responsible for nearly 70% of Chewy's net sales. Chewy plans to eventually offer the service nationwide.


"We have focused our efforts into developing an easy to use and convenient tele-triage product that we anticipate will have a positive impact given the current environment, and also extend beyond that," Chewy Chief Executive Sumit Singh said in written comments [with the announcement](https://investor.chewy.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2020/Chewy-Launches-Innovative-Telehealth-Service-for-Pets-With-Plans-to-Expand-Nationwide/default.aspx). "Visiting a local vet continues to be a challenge for many pet parents during this time. Similarly, the vet community has also been impacted via clinic shutdowns or reduced clinic hours."

The news helped Chewy buck the market trend and break out of a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) formation with a buy point of 70.82. The buy range extends to 74.36.


Shares jumped 6.3% to close at 72.01 in heavy volume on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Chewy Stock: Keep An Eye On Market
----------------------------------


While Chewy stock thrived Wednesday, keep in mind the sharp reversal in stock markets makes buying stocks a risky pursuit at this time. Investor's Business Daily on Monday changed its market direction outlook to "[uptrend under pressure](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx)."


This would be a good time to [review sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), an exit strategy that can help limit your losses. The IBD [CAN SLIM method of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) says limit losses to no more than 7% or 8% from your purchase price.


In this scenario, if Chewy was bought at the buy point of 70.82 and drops below 65.86, or 7%, investors should consider getting out, especially now that the market is imploding.


With that in mind here are some current positive indicators for Chewy stock.


One of them is the relative strength line is at new highs. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is found in daily and weekly charts at [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com). It compares the stock's daily price performance to the S&P 500. An upward-sloping relative strength line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. A downward-sloping line means the stock is lagging the S&P 500.


IBD Checkup On Chewy Stock
--------------------------


Also, Chewy has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 96. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


In addition, the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-chewy-inc-cl-a-chwy.htm) tool shows Chewy has a [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 81. The rating means Chewy stock currently outperforms 81% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria


Another thing to consider is that Chewy is seen as a coronavirus play. Like many e-commerce stocks, such as **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), business is good because an increasing amount of people are preferring to shop online, rather than venturing out to a store, which can increase exposure to the virus.


Coronavirus plays were among the few stocks doing well on Wednesday.


Spun Out Of PetSmart
--------------------


Chewy was spun out of PetSmart in June 2019 with an initial public offering that raised $1.02 billion, pricing the stock at 22.


Chewy ended the second quarter with 16.5 million active customers. The company claims the title of largest U.S. online retailer of pet food and supplies. It provides free shipping on orders above $49. Below that brings a service charge of $4.95.


Chewy reported [fiscal second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chewy-stock-earnings-second-quarter-chwy/) on Sept. 10 that beat Wall Street estimates. Revenue jumped 47% to $1.7 billion. It showed an adjusted loss of 8 cents, smaller than an expected loss of 18 cents.


The results were for its fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 2. Chewy has yet to show a profit. However, the consensus among Wall Street analysts looks for Chewy to turn profitable in mid-2021.


Chewy stock is up 144% this year.

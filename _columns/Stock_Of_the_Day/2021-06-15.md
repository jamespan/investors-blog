**SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)), an oil and gas explorer and producer, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). After breaking out from a base this month, SM stock pulled back but is setting up as a potential buy again.




The setup for the shale producer, which operates in Texas, comes as demand for oil and gas generally rebounds, following the hit it took last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.


U.S. benchmark oil prices have also topped the key $70-per-barrel level recently and are holding above it, propping up SM stock and others in the energy sector.


SM Stock
--------


Shares closed up 6% at 22.66 on the [stock market today.](https://investors.com/stock-market-today) Among other top shale stocks, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) rallied 5.1%, **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) added 0.9%, and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) was flat.


SM stock jumped earlier this month, past a 20.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), and then retreated in modest volume. The stock is extended from that earlier entry as the chase zone tops out at 21.47.


However, a buying opportunity could emerge if shares pull back to their 21-day line then rebound higher off of it, IBD's research indicates.


SM stock has an 84 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 42. The stock's relative strength line has fallen this month.


SM Energy's first-quarter results, reported in April, beat expectations. But the company has lost money in four of its last five quarters, even as profits recover elsewhere in the oil industry.


Those results came despite "exceptional challenges" presented by severe weather earlier in the year. Winter storms in February left millions in Texas without power.Â Still, the company left its full-year 2021 outlook unchanged.


SM stock fell a day after the results were reported. In its earnings release, SM said it remains focused on generating free cash flow and reducing debt.

Oil Prices Bullish For SM Stock
-------------------------------


Crude futures got a lift earlier this month when [OPEC and its allies reaffirmed their plan to gradually boost output](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-meeting-june-2021-iran-nuclear-talks-oil-prices/), even as demand spikes during the peak summer driving season.


OPEC also estimates global oil inventories will shrink significantly in the second half of the year as the global economic rebound picks up.


Meanwhile, the return of Iranian crude to the global market appears further away as negotiators struggle to make progress on reviving a nuclear deal that lifted economic sanctions.


Another factor in oil's rally is the U.S. shale sector's focus on returning capital to shareholders and spending discipline. That's in contrast to the past, when producers spent heavily to ramp up production, adding more supply to global markets and putting downward pressure on oil prices.


SM Energy has shale assets in the Permian Basin in west Texas as well as in south Texas, where the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations converge.


Wall Street analysts have been upbeat about the strong performance of SM's wells but are eager to see the company continue to reduce debt.

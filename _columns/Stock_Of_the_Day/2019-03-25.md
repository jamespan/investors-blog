Heico stock is performing well with [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) fundamentals. It has a 97 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trading at record highs. The RS line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, is the blue line in the chart below and in Marketsmith.



Aerospace Stocks Weather Boeing Turbulence
------------------------------------------


Heico stock is ranked second within IBD's Aerospace/Defense group, which is rated No. 58 out of IBD's 197 industries. That's down from No. 8 two weeks ago due to the sharp sell-off in industry giant Boeing over the 737 Max. But aside from Boeing stock — up 2.3% Monday — most of the group's top stocks have held up well.


Fellow defense supplier stock **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) is also showing strength. [Mercury Systems](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/mercury-stock-f-35-defense-budget/) is tied with Heico stock for the No. 2 spot in the Aerospace/Defense group. Mercury Systems stock fell 0.6% Monday, slightly extended from a post-earnings breakout on Jan. 30.


Defense stocks have been doing well as the Trump administration wants to hike the Pentagon's 2020 budget by 5% to counter growing threats from abroad.

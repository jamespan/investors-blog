Dividend stock**NextEra Energy Partners** ([NEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEP)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is flirting with a buy point. Utility stocks are in favor with the broader stock market facing headwinds. But a strong run-up this year for NextEra Energy Partners stock could limit the upside for the clean energy company.







NextEra Energy Partners stock dipped 0.3% to close at 47.62 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) as it eyes a potential 48.85 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) as part of a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/).


Florida-based NextEra Energy Partners is a limited partnership formed in 2014 by utility giant **NextEra Energy** ([NEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEE)) to acquire, manage and own clean energy projects with stable cash flows. Besides wind and solar projects, NextEra Energy Partners also owns natural gas infrastructure assets, serving producers in the Eagle Ford Shale.


NextEra Energy Partners' [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is on the rise and just below the early July peak, a bullish sign.


NextEra Energy Partners stock boasts solid fundamentals, reflected in an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 87 out a best-possible 99. It also claims an excellent [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 97.

The partnership's top line bears watching. Sales growth decelerated from 56% in 2016 to 6% in 2017.


That, together with lackluster return on equity, leads to a mediocre [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=SMR+Rating&termid=1) of C.


Stock Of The Day Is A Top Dividend Stock
----------------------------------------


NextEra Energy Partners offers a higher payout than many of the growth names featured as the IBD Stock of the Day. The NextEra Energy Partners dividend is $1.66 annually, yielding 3.5%.


NextEra Energy Partners operates in a capital-intensive industry, contributing to a 193% debt-to-equity ratio. But the recent sale of its Canadian portfolio of wind and solar projects should boost long-term growth. The proceeds should be redeployed into higher-yielding U.S. assets later this year, CEO Jim Robo said in July.


Those U.S. assets will benefit from a longer federal income tax shield and a lower effective corporate tax rate, he added. In turn, that will allow NextEra Energy Partners to retain more cash available for distribution (CAFD) — a key metric for investors — in the future for every $1 invested.


NextEra Energy Stock Is In Buy Zone
-----------------------------------


Parent company NextEra Energy traces its roots to the Florida Power & Light Company, which debuted on Dec. 28, 1925. In 2010, FPL Group changed its name to NextEra Energy, reflecting its environmental commitment and plans to expand outside Florida.


NextEra Energy stock is just in buy range from a 165.25 flat-base entry. Shares rose 0.5% to finish at 172.77.


NextEra Energy stock has a 2.6% dividend yield.

Fake-meat producer **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the recent IPO is consolidating bullishly. Beyond Meat stock does not yet have a proper base or buy point though.




Beyond Meat makes plant-based burgers and sausages that have the taste and texture of real meat. **Del Taco** ([TACO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TACO)), Applebee's (owned by **Dine Brands** ([DIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIN))), Tim Horton's (owned by Burger King parent **Restaurant Brands** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR))) and Carl's Jr. serve Beyond Meat products in their restaurants.


Industry watchers say that the company could nab fast-food giant **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) as former McDonald's CEO Don Thompson is on Beyond Meat's board.


Beyond Meat Stock Technical Analysis
------------------------------------


Shares dipped 0.2% to 166.53 after rising intraday to 170.70 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Beyond Meat stock broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) at 85.55, skyrocketing to a record 201.88 intraday on June 18. That was up 708% from the Beyond Meat IPO price of 25 in early May.


Since then, shares have consolidated, finding support at the 21-day moving average. But BYND stock hasn't formed a proper base yet — it needs a few more weeks — so there is no buy point for investors to watch.


But if Beyond Meat stock hits a new high, aggressive investors could buy it at 201.98.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for BYND stock is just below a record high, a bullish sign.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-beyond-meat-inc-bynd.htm?fromsearch=1), Beyond Meat stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89 out of a possible 99. Its EPS Rating is only 17 out of 99. But the stock is ranked No.1 in IBD's Food-Meat Products Group.


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) is another hot recent IPO that is consolidating but does not yet have a proper base or entry. Zoom stock climbed 7% to 99.80 Monday, working toward a June 20 peak of 107.34.


Beyond Meat Sales Top Estimates
-------------------------------


Last month, Beyond Meat reported a loss of 14 cents per share in its first [quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/beyond-meat-earnings-q1-2019-beyond-meat-stock/) as a public company, in line with analyst expectations. But revenue jumped 215% to $40.2 million on Beyond Burger sales, above Wall Street expectations. Food service revenue climbed nearly 500% to $20.6 million.


Management sees full-year total revenue of more than $210 million, above consensus at the time for $205 million.


The company sees Asia as a "strong part" of its international strategy to expand sales. Beyond Meat hasn't yet turned a profit but is expected to in 2020.


But after earnings, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman [downgraded the stock](https://www.investors.com/news/beyond-meat-stock-downgrade-valuation/) on its high share price.


Fake-Meat Competition Heats Up
------------------------------


There's increasing demand for plant-based products and fake meat in particular. But Beyond Meat faces increased competition from meat producers. **Tyson Foods** ([TSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSN)) launched its own plant-based and blended products unit.


Beyond Meat also faces competition from other plant-based-meat producers like Impossible Foods, which has products at Burger King, Qdoba and **Red Robin Gourmet Burgers** ([RRBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRBG)). Impossible Foods has said it's in no rush to go public.

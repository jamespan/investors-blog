**Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is a unique Chinese e-commerce company that smashed second-quarter earnings estimates Wednesday. Pinduoduo stock jumped 13.5%, near 29.47, in afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).




The company has the third-largest e-commerce platform in China by gross merchandise volume. It places an emphasis on group purchases, enabled by a social networking approach for its users. The two largest e-commerce companies in China are **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)).


Shanghai-based Pinduoduo runs an e-commerce site it describes as "Costco meets Disneyland," combining value and entertainment. The company has built its e-commerce platform to resemble a virtual bazaar where buyers can explore a full spectrum of products while interacting with one another.


Before the market open Wednesday, Pinduoduo [reported second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinduoduo-earnings-second-quarter-stock/) that showed revenue of $1.06 billion, up 169% in Chinese currency from the year-ago quarter. Wall Street expected $878.8 million. It reported an adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, smashing Wall Street views for a 19-cent loss.

The company held its [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinduoduo-ipo-initial-public-offering/) in July 2018, pricing shares at 19 and raising $1.6 billion.


Pinduoduo Stock Analysis
------------------------


Pinduoduo stock is climbing the right side of [a deep cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/), with a buy point of 32.09. The depth of that cup base at 42% is one troubling sign for the stock. Shares previously went through another deep cup base of 46%, running from late 2018 to early 2019.


The stock has an [IBD Accumulation/Distribution rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/accumulation-slh-distribution--op-acc-slh-distm-cp--rating) of B+, suggesting heavy accumulation among institutional investors. It has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 89 out of a possible 99, which reflects its strong [stock market performance](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The company has yet to show a profit but is expected to do so in 2020. Revenue has grown at a triple-digit rate for the past four quarters. Wall Street expects revenue this year of about $4 billion, more than double that from the prior year.


The company's e-commerce platform offers a wide range of products, including apparel and shoes, products for moms, furniture, household goods and electronics. It also sells food and beverages.


Annual spending per active buyer in the 12-month period ended June 30 jumped 92% to $213.80. Over the same time period, gross merchandise volume processed on its site soared 171% to more than $103 billion.


Average monthly active users soared 88% to 366 million.


'Substantial Upside In Monetization'
------------------------------------


KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Hans Chung initiated coverage on Pinduoduo in mid-April. He has a price target on Pinduoduo stock of 32, with a rating of overweight.


"We see substantial upside in monetization, with multiple drivers down the road," Chung wrote in a note to clients.


Backers of Pinduoduo include China-based **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), a leader in messaging, mobile payments and mobile gaming in China.


Tencent supports Pinduoduo with services such as payment solutions, cloud services, and user engagement via Tencent's WeChat mobile platform.


Different From Alibaba, JD.com
------------------------------


Pinduoduo is different from Alibaba and JD.com in that social networking features on its e-commerce site, helped by Tencent, enable a team approach to buying, at discounted prices. It enables sellers on the platform to receive bulk purchases, providing economies of scale that can lower costs.


"In most cases, Pinduoduo's model has helped streamline the value chain by reducing inefficient and redundant layers of product distribution," Chung wrote. "We view the business model as similar to that of Costco Wholesale, while we believe the model could be even more scalable and thorough given the marketplace-based nature and social network leverage."

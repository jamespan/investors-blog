**Academy Sports & Outdoor** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as Americans, now armed with stimulus cash, should continue to enjoy the outdoors even after the pandemic subsides. ASO stock is near a buy point after maintaining key support.




The Katy, Texas-based company operates nearly 260 stores across 16 states, mainly in the southern U.S. Academy's product assortment focuses on key categories of outdoor, apparel, footwear, and sports and recreation.


After blowout earnings, the outlook for Academy appears strong in the year ahead, even as it comes up against tougher comparisons.


This year, massive stimulus spending is driving favorable trends, while the company "sees the hobbies formed during the Covid-19 as sticky," JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in an ASO stock note to clients April 19.


He added that the company believes it can keep growing sales in 2021 vs. tough comps, as organized sports resume and kids return to school in the fall.


"Indeed, from a category perspective, ASO noted that almost all categories are back with team sports ramping up in the spring and consumers starting to buy licensed apparel while categories like fishing and home gym equipment that saw growth last year remain strong," he wrote. "Moreover, ASO is not seeing any signs of pull-forward in big ticket items like trampolines or pools."

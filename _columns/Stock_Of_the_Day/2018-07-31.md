Jazz's biggest drug is Xyrem, which treats excessive sleepiness known as narcolepsy. But Jazz is working on a next-generation narcolepsy drug that an expert cited by Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said could be even better.


"Our expert views the high sodium content of Xyrem as a troublesome limitation, and believes that a low sodium product (i.e., JZP-258) would be a welcome alternative," Amsellem said in a recent report to clients.


The firm expects to have a Phase 3 study of JZP-258 in excessive sleepiness fully enrolled in the fourth quarter. The expert also sees a place in the market for Jazz's drug called solriamfetol in treating excessive sleepiness. Solriamfetol could rival **Teva Pharmaceutical**'s ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)) drug, Provigil.


"Jazz remains one of the most attractive larger-cap growth stories in the broader pharma space in our view," Amsellem wrote. He reiterated his 211 price target and overweight rating on Jazz stock in his July 16 report.


Less Dependent On Xyrem?
------------------------


For the second quarter, analysts expect Jazz late next Tuesday to report adjusted income of $3.19 per share on $470 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted profit would rise 25%. Sales would increase 19% vs. the year-earlier period.


In the year-ago quarter, Xyrem accounted for 76% of total sales. But Jazz was slightly less dependent on the narcolepsy treatment in the first quarter. Then, it brought in 71% of revenue. In total, Jazz has six drugs approved in the U.S. and four approved outside the U.S.


Erwinaze, a chemotherapy for a type of blood cancer, is Jazz's second most important drug. The spelling of the drug changes slightly to Erwinase for sale outside the U.S. In the year-earlier second quarter, the drug brought in 12% of total revenue. In the more recent first quarter this year, it generated 11% of sales.


Since the year-earlier period, Jazz launched Vyxeos in the U.S. in August 2017. Vyxeos is a chemotherapy treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Sales of Vyxeos generated about 6% of total revenue in the first quarter.

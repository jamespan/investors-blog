Ciena is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for the second time in three weeks as the company continues to shine while delivering important lessons for investors.




Two of Ciena's investing lessons involve competitive dynamics. One focuses on a supplier of optical devices to Ciena, which is **NeoPhotonics** ([NPTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NPTN)).


The other lesson involves **Infinera** ([INFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFN)), a Ciena rival. In these two cases, savvy investors paid attention to developments involving Ciena's supply chain as well as a market rival.


First, some technical analysis. The last time Investor's Business Daily checked in on Ciena stock, the maker of fiber-optic communications systems saw its [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) had improved amid a sell-off in technology. That's a bullish sign. In September, Ciena stock had formed a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). That's also usually a positive signal.

Further, Ciena climbed out of a flat-base pattern on Nov. 5, a couple of weeks following its improvement in relative strength and the [first IBD Stock of the Day feature](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-ciena-stock-builds/). Ciena stock gained 5% that day. One thing to note is that it remains near the top end of its buy zone, which could pose some risk in today's market.


Ciena Stock: A NeoPhotonics Customer
------------------------------------


Now consider NeoPhotonics, which late last week reported a narrower-than-expected loss while issuing bullish guidance. NeoPhotonics stock popped 12% on Nov. 1 and 1.5% the next day.


Ciena is NeoPhotonics' second-biggest customer behind China's Huawei. NeoPhotonics, in its third-quarter financials, disclosed that its revenue from Ciena had jumped 13% from the June quarter.


Ciena made up 28% of NeoPhotonics third-quarter revenue compared with 25% the previous quarter


If NeoPhotonics is shipping more optical devices to Ciena, then Ciena must be ramping up production for its customers, investors believed.


Hanover, Md.-based Ciena makes system-level optical products for communications networks and data centers.


Ciena Stock: Rival Infinera Misses
----------------------------------


Next, look at Infinera's earnings report late Nov. 6. Infinera missed on both third-quarter revenue and December quarter guidance. Infinera stock tanked 33% on Nov. 7. Ciena stock gained 2%, touching a 10-year high.


If Infinera's turnaround is in jeopardy, investors believed, that's good news for Ciena. One overhang on Infinera stock is the $430 million purchase of Coriant. That deal closed Oct. 1.


Buying Coriant could provide a long-term boost for Infinera. In the near-term, though, it'll have to integrate both companies product lines and employees.


"We'd rather see investors play Ciena on the long side," said George Notter, a Jefferies analyst, in a report published on Nov. 7. "We like the company's great core technology, strong competitive positioning, potential for significant share gains, and valuation."


Ciena, meanwhile, could get a boost as some customers shift to next-generation data center technology.


Stock Of The Day: Upgrade To 400G
---------------------------------


There's also the fact that internet giants such as **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) plan an upgrade for so-called "hyperscale" data centers. Many Wall Street analysts expect the move to 400 gigabits per second, or 400G, to unfold in the back half of 2019. High volume production of devices may wait until 2020.


Ciena could discuss the shift to 400G technology from 100G when it reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in early December. **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), another Ciena rival, aims for a rebound with 400G product shipments.


Analysts expect Ciena stock to get an earnings boost from the settlement of 2018 convertible debt as well as a share repurchase program.


The optical gear maker has an ongoing $300 million stock buyback that will reduce outstanding shares. That should be a plus for earnings growth.


Ciena stock slipped 0.7% to close at 34.43 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

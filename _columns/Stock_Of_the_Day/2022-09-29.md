**WWE** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day for Thursday. The entertainment and wrestling giant sits on three straight quarters of earnings growth and five straight quarters of revenue growth despite executive controversies and shake-ups. WWE stock is up nearly 40% year-to-date and with a 12-month gain of 22%.




In July, Stephanie McMahon and Nick Khan were officially appointed to serve as co-CEOs following the departure of Vince McMahon.


Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father as well as WWE founder and longtime CEO, stepped down after a June [investigation into payments to former employees](https://www.investors.com/news/wwe-stock-tumbles-as-ceo-mcmahon-steps-aside-during-misconduct-investigation/) to cover up sexual misconduct. In total, there were $19.6 million in unrecorded expenses made by McMahon before leaving the company, which dated back to 2006.


Meanwhile, Stephanie McMahon's husband, Paul "Triple H" Levesque, was appointed chief creative officer in early September to assume a hefty portion of the two McMahons' former duties.


Despite the executive shake-ups, WWE managed to just beat expectations for its [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/wwe-stock-climbs-on-earnings-beat-former-ceo-investigation-substantially-complete/) in August. WWE earnings jumped 70% over the year to 58 cents per share, while revenue climbed 23% to $328.2 million.


WWE is expanding its international footprint by securing streaming deals with **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), Foxtel Group and NBCUniversal, which is owned by **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)). It is also adding more overseas events in Saudi Arabia, the U.K. and Ireland.


Its premium live events — WrestleMania, WrestleMania Backlash and Hell in a Cell — were the most viewed in its history. And the company raised its full-year guidance to adjusted operating income of $370 million to $385 million vs. the previous outlook of $360 million to $375 million.

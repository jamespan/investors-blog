**Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it finds support at a key level.




Near a two-decade high after strong gains in 2023, Copart stock is also working on a new buy point as investors hope for AI-powered earnings growth.


Copart Stock Performance
------------------------


Shares of the vehicle auction specialist fell 2.5% to 49.23 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/). But Copart stock rebounded from a 50-day line test soon after the open, coming back to its 21-day moving average.


The CPRT stock chart shows a 51.53 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) from a 13-week flat base, according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?intcode=lgnv%7Clgnv%7CMarketSmith%7C2023%7C06%7Cmsp%7Cna%7C%7C725068&src=A00653). Investors could use 51.27 as a slightly early entry.



The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/#:~:text=The%20relative%20strength%20line's%20job,it%20to%20the%20S%26P%20500.) for Copart stock has weakened and is well off the consolidation high. However, the RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, rallied strongly for most of 2023. A rising RS line means a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index.


In the past 52 weeks, Copart stock surged around 44%. In fact, CPRT stock is on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list, thanks in part to a history of consistent profit growth and share price outperformance


Copart Earnings Report
----------------------


On Nov. 16, Copart posted earnings of 34 cents per share for its fiscal first quarter, spiking 31% year-over-year. That was the best gain in years.


Sales accelerated for a second straight quarter to $1.02 billion, FactSet shows.


Copart stock surged in November on earnings, then pulled back to form its current flat-base pattern.


For the fiscal year 2024, which ends in July, analysts expect Copart earnings per share to grow 16.7% vs. 2023. Sales are seen rising 9.8% for the year.


Though solid, growth is slowing. The [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-copart-cprt.aspx) shows a three-year earnings growth rate of 23% and three-year sales growth rate of 22%, well above Wall Street's expectations for fiscal 2024.


Bringing AI To Auctions
-----------------------


Notably, Copart last year announced an AI (artificial intelligence) pact to support auto insurers.


The [collaboration is with Hi Marley](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/copart-stock-new-another-breakout-after-eye-popping-11-year-gain/) â€” the first intelligent conversational platform built for property and casualty insurance.


Copart aims to use AI to drive faster and more accurate total loss decision.


The Dallas-based company was founded in 1982 with a single salvage yard in California. It now operates more than 250 locations for online vehicle auctions in 11 countries.

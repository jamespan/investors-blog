Building materials company **Owens Corning** ([OC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the homebuilding boom drives strong earnings. OC stock is above a buy point.




Toledo, Ohio-based Owens Corning is a global maker of building and industrial materials. The company manufactures a broad range of insulation, roofing and fiberglass composite materials. Owens Corning posted 2020 sales of $7.1 billion.


The key economic factors that impact the company's businesses are residential repair and remodeling activity, U.S. housing starts as well as global commercial construction and industrial production activity.


Owens Corning Earnings
----------------------


On Wednesday, the company reported that first-quarter EPS soared 179% to $1.73, topping forecasts for $1.42, on a 20% increase in revenue to $1.9 billion, better than estimates for $1.8 billion.


The results were driven by higher volumes and strong price realization across all three of its segments. Roofing, which accounted for 38% of sales, saw a 28% increase. Insulation, which makes up 37% of revenue, grew 16%. And Composites, which comprise 25% of sales, climbed 16%.


"In the near term, the company expects the U.S. residential housing market to remain robust and the commercial and industrial markets to continue to strengthen," Owens Corning said in its earnings statement.

Hot Housing Market
------------------


The hot housing market in the U.S. is showing no signs of a cool-down. The National Association of Home Builders says existing single-family inventory in March stood at 2.1-month supply, less than half what a healthy market needs.


And while homebuilding is moving at its fastest pace since 2006, new home inventory stands at a thin 3.6-month supply, NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz wrote in a recent [blog](https://nahbnow.com/2021/04/is-the-housing-market-too-hot/). As a result, demand for materials needed to build or renovate homes is skyrocketing, pushing prices higher.


CFRA Research analyst Richard Wolfe said in a note to clients on Wednesday that he expects repair and remodeling trends to remain strong in 2021, supported by increased home sales, homebuilding and housing prices. 


He also cites a Home Improvement Research Institute survey that shows a key driver for the uptick in do-it-yourself projects is extra time at home.


"Given our view that work-from-home trends will outlast the pandemic, we believe consumers will be spending more time at home, causing a structural uptick in home improvement trends," Wolfe wrote. "Additionally, we think as it becomes safer to have contractors inside the home, a lot of DIY spending will transfer to do-it-for-me, which generally includes bigger-ticket improvements."


Meanwhile, commercial catalysts include retrofitting opportunities from Covid-19 coupled with a climate-change focused infrastructure bill, Wolfe said. 


"One of the primary trends we expect to see in the building products industry is the shift to energy efficiency and smart buildings," he wrote.

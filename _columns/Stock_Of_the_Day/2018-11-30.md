**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The pizza giant has delivered a long string of solid earnings growth. Domino's stock is on the road to a new buy point after making two bullish technical moves.




Domino's Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


Domino's stock is working on the right side of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a buy point of 305.44. Shares fell 1% to close at 277.32 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) after rising for the past seven sessions. Domino's stock also is at the cusp of breaking a three-month trend line.


Domino's stock began its recent winning streak on Nov. 20, after rebounding bullishly from a seven-month intraday low. That was the same day that the Nasdaq composite hit a fresh low. On Wednesday, as the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) confirmed a new rally, Domino's stock reclaimed its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), a bullish advance over the key technical benchmark.


The recent Domino's stock action shows how even top stocks tend to move with the broader markets.



Another positive sign is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which has been holding not too far from highs in a choppy market. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


Stock Of The Day Fundamentals Strong
------------------------------------


Domino's Pizza has posted revenue growth above 20% for the past three quarters. But Domino's earnings growth is even more impressive, with 10 straight quarters of double-digit gains. Domino's earnings per share rose 54% in the most recent quarter. However, revenue and same-store sales just missed, sending shares lower for a time.


The hot stock's solid fundamentals are reflected in its strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 94 out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 97 indicates stellar earnings growth.

Domino's Pizza Delivers On Innovation
-------------------------------------


Restaurant analyst Mark Kalinowski, of Kalinowski Equity Research, previously attributed Domino's revenue gains to several factors.


These include technological advantages over other pizza companies, as more customers order online and via their smartphones. He also cited a value deal that the chain has had in place for nearly 10 years: two medium pizzas with two toppings for $5.99 apiece.


Domino's Pizza has been working with **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) on delivery via autonomous vehicles.


And while rival **Papa John's** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) has been flailing amid the fallout from the resignation of founder John Schnatter, Domino's Pizza has been progressing despite a leadership change of its own.


The hot stock has enjoyed an orderly transition to [CEO Richard Allison](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/19/new-dominos-pizza-ceo-describes-fortressing-process.html), who took the reins in July. The former president of Domino's International took over from [J. Patrick Doyle](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/patrick-doyle-dove-into-the-hot-kitchen-to-make-dominos-pizza-an-extra-large-success/), who had led the firm for eight years.


Restaurant Stocks Faring Well
-----------------------------


**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) are extended from recent breakouts. **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)), which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Domino's rival Pizza Hut, is flirting with a buy point.

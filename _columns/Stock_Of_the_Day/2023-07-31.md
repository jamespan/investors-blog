Leveraging Artificial Intelligence
----------------------------------


New York City-based UiPath makes robotic process automation software. UiPath's software scans documents, imports and mines data, and automates business processes. Its software also leverages innovations in artificial intelligence to improve efficiency.


On June 27, UiPath announced new services to accelerate customers' ability to discover, automate, and operate automations at scale through generative AI and specialized AI.


"UiPath is uniquely able to combine our understanding of screens, documents, tasks, and processes with the intelligence of generalized AI to watch work happen, understand what is being done, and automate it in our platform," Graham Sheldon, chief product officer at UiPath, said in a [news release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230627036547/en/).


He added, "Only when AI is combined with enterprise automation, to provide context and take appropriate action, will companies realize the complete value."


PATH Stock: Earnings Report Ahead
---------------------------------


The next catalyst for PATH stock could be the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report, due in late August.

Meanwhile, UiPath has posted three straight quarters of earnings growth on a year-over-year basis after two consecutive quarters of losses.


For UiPath's fiscal second quarter, Wall Street is calling for earnings of 3 cents a share on sales of $282.1 million. In the year-earlier period, UiPath lost 2 cents a share on sales of $242.2 million.

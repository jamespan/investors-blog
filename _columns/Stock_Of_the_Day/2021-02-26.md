Luxury home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as elevated spending on homes continues while Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) recently added to its stake. RH stock is near a buy point.




Formerly known as Restoration Hardware, RH sells upscale home furnishings through retail galleries in the U.S. and Canada, source books and online.


While the pandemic forced many retailers to close some stores and pare back planned openings, RH is forging ahead in more markets.


In July it opened a 60,000-square-foot location in Marin, Calif. The location included a rooftop restaurant. RH plans to open four new design galleries in North America in 2021 and is preparing a big push into Europe.


Meanwhile, RH plans to expand its brand beyond the $200 billion home furnishings and furniture market. It eyes the hotel business with new RH Guesthouses and the $1.7 trillion housing market with RH Residences.

**RH Earnings, Outlook**
------------------------


RH stock soared in the months after the pandemic prompted stay-at-home orders, as affluent homeowners spent heavily on revamping home offices and study spaces. Spending on the home is showing no sign of a slowdown yet. Furniture and home furnishing sales totaled $11.35 billion in January, according to the Commerce Department. That's up 12% from December 2020 and 11.7% from January 2020.


Q3 earnings more than doubled to $6.20 a share as revenue jumped 25% to $844.8 million. Analysts see Q4 EPS of $4.79, a 29% increase from the year-ago quarter, on sales of $795.4 million, 20% more than the prior year, according Zacks Investment Research.


That's not to say the pandemic hasn't thrown a monkey wrench into RH's operations.


"Due to higher than anticipated demand and disruptions across our global supply chain as a result of the virus, total company revenue growth lagged demand by approximately 8 points in the third quarter," CEO Gary Friedman said in a letter to investors after the release of Q3 results in December.


Friedman added that the gap between demand and revenue growth would persist into Q4, though to a lesser extent. He expects product supply to catch up to demand in the second half of 2021.


As Covid infection rates decline and more people get vaccinated, industry watchers say consumers may shift spending away from the home and into travel and entertainment in the coming months. The recent spike in Treasury yields is also lifting mortgage rates, cooling the hot housing market.


Still, CEO Friedman says he doesn't expect sales to suddenly fall off a cliff. 


"It's safe to assume that some level of elevated spending on the home will remain through 2021, and possibly beyond," he said in December. "The booming real estate activity in second home markets, an accelerated shift of families moving to larger suburban homes, the uptick in homebuilding, and a record equity market should drive increased spending for an extended period of time as the cycle for purchasing and furnishing a home is anything but quick."

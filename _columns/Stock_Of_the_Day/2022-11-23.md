**RBC Bearings** ([RBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBC)) is the [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. The company's earnings and revenue are wheeling right along after acquiring a major competitor last November. And RBC stock is nearing another buy point after breaking out in August.




The Oxford, Conn.-based company specializes in the bearings and tiny parts for machines, aircraft and heavy-duty industrial equipment. Although the parts tend to be quite small, they play crucial roles in reducing damage, wear and energy loss caused by friction.


RBC Bearings revenue growth accelerated the past five quarters and earnings saw a dramatic uptick the last two quarters.


RBC acquired rival Asea Brown Boveri's (ABB) DODGE Mechanical Power Transmission business for $2.9 billion in cash last November. The move doubled RBC's revenue. DODGE generated $617 million sales for the 12 months ending in July 2021. And RBC Bearings reported $607 million in revenue for its fiscal 2021.


For its [most recent quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/machine-parts-maker-rbc-bearings-strong-earnings-outlook-boost-shares/) on Nov. 10, RBC reported earnings leapt 66% to $1.93 per share and revenue skyrocketed 129% to $369 million. That topped analyst estimates of $1.81 per share on $361 million in revenue.


And despite having fewer production days during the current Q3 quarter, RBC expects a strong 30% to 35% increase in sales to range between $348 million and $360 million.

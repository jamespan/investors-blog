The [IBD Stock-Of-The-Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) is **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), a profitable Israel-based software company that's growing quarterly revenue at a consistent double-digit pace.







CyberArk's technology focuses on eliminating the most advanced cyberthreats, such as those that use insider privileges to attack the heart of an enterprise. The software focuses on protecting organizations from undetected cyberattacks that have made their way inside the network perimeter.


Password management tools and human-access protection for information technology departments are CyberArk's bread and butter. Sales more than doubled over the past three fiscal years, to $262 million in 2017 from $103 million in 2014.


The company held its initial public offering in September 2014, pricing CyberArk stock at $16 each. CyberArk stock closed at 78, up 1% on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

The company also is on the exclusive [IBD Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) of top-performing companies.


It currently ranks No. 2 in the [IBD 50 roster of growth companies](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Two other cybersecurity firms, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) also are members of the IBD 50. The list seeks out the best stocks to buy and watch with top fundamentals.


CyberArk Stock Buy Point
------------------------


According to Leaderboard analysis, the stock has been consolidating gains since November. The choppy and erratic behavior of the stock makes the base suspect, but that's a flaw found in many leading stocks after the bear market.


The stock has a buy point of 84.31, with a buy range up to 88.53.


CyberArk also is the top-ranked stock in the Computer Software-Security group, holding a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). The Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to measure a stock's leadership potential.


KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Rob Owens in a research note last week said fundamentals for cybersecurity companies "remain strong" for this year amid an expected slowdown in overall spending on information technology.


"The continued prioritization of security, a robust threat landscape, increased compliance requirements and the continued march to cloud all remain promising drivers of sustained momentum for the sector, lending increased resiliency," he wrote.


Outperform Rating, Earnings Beat
--------------------------------


Oppenheimer has an outperform rating on CyberArk stock and price target of 89.


CyberArk reported a [third-quarter profit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cyberark-stock-earnings-guidance/) that blew past analyst estimates while its fourth-quarter earnings outlook also topped expectations.


Adjusted third-quarter earnings of 48 cents a share were up 92% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 31% to $84.7 million.


The company reports fourth-quarter results before the market open on Feb. 14. Wall Street analysts expect adjusted earnings of 59 cents a share, up 44%, on revenue of $95.7 million, up 19%.

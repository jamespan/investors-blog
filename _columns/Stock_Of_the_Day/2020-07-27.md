Limbered up by a recent acquisition, yoga apparel leader **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it stretches into a new buy zone.




On June 29, [Lululemon announced it will spend $500 million to purchase Mirror](https://investor.lululemon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lululemon-athletica-inc-acquire-home-fitness-innovator-mirror), a leading in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald says the acquisition expands its "digital sweatlife offerings [to] bring immersive and personalized in-home sweat, and mindfulness solutions to new and existing Lululemon guests."


Lululemon's purchase of Mirror ties into its so-called Power of Three growth plan, which includes driving the business through multifaceted experiences.


Offering live weekly classes and thousands of on-demand workouts, Mirror also provides immersive one-on-one personal training. The company launched in 2018 as demand for in-home fitness offerings increased. That trend is in sync with lifestyle changes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.


The transaction builds on the partnership between Lululemon and Mirror, which began in 2019. The collaboration also includes a content partnership that incorporated sweat and meditation classes into the Mirror platform through Lululemon's Global Ambassadors.

LULU Stock In Position For Rebound
----------------------------------


Although LULU stock did not make IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutuall-funds-invest-big-in-aapl-amzn-fb-nflx-googl-msft-adbe-zm-docu/), 267 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning shares. Plus, four members of the IBD Mutual Fund Index own Lululemon shares, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Fidelity OTC (FOCPX).


Analysts expect Lululemon to report fiscal Q2 earnings in early September. After it already reported a 70% decline in earnings for fiscal Q1 (ended May 3), market watchers are expecting a 14% decline in earnings for the full fiscal year. But analysts see EPS rebounding to a 49% increase in fiscal 2022.


Strong [institutional support](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of LULU stock — including a 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/), a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership — is one reason for the bright outlook.


Lululemon also sports strong fundamentals. It had a 22.6% pretax profit margin and 38% return on equity for the fiscal year that ended in January. Such efficiency has helped Lululemon generate average annual earnings growth of 35% over the last three years.


The sharp drop in earnings growth last quarter is a key reason for the drop in the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) for LULU stock to an 89. Although Lululemon's clothing and accessories retail industry group ranks a lowly No. 108 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks, the Canada-based retailer earns top-billing among its peers.


LULU Stock Warms Up New Buy Zone
--------------------------------


LULU stock cleared a 324.86 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) on July 20 in rising, but below-average, volume. Heavy trade on the day of a breakout confirms demand for a stock, so tepid volume is a concern. That trepidation is reflected in the stock's action since then.


The stock floated in and out of buy range after the breakout. Lululemon opened Monday by reclaiming that buy zone, then hesitated after the open. But LULU stock closed strong, gaining over 3%, lifting it solidly back into the buy zone. Volume for the day was below average, but shot higher in the final hour of the session.


LULU stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) continues upward and remains within striking distance of a new 52-week high.


As LULU stock tests the new buy zone, the yoga guru is just shy of a new all-time high.

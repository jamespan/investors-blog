**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the graphics-chip maker approaches a buy point ahead of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. NVDA stock rose on Monday.




Over the past 13 weeks, NVDA stock has formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 587.76, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), NVDA stock cleared a resistance level around 560. On Monday, NVDA stock rose 6.2% to close at 577.55.


Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia plans to report financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Feb. 24. Analysts predict that Nvidia will earn $2.80 a share, up 48% year over year, on sales of $4.81 billion, up 55%, in the fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31.


That report could be the next catalyst for NVDA stock, though Nvidia shares barely budged after its fiscal third-quarter report.

Cryptocurrency Mining Could Be Near-Term Driver
-----------------------------------------------


NVDA stock is on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks as well as IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) list.


Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse on Saturday reiterated his outperform rating on NVDA stock with a price target of 675. Nvidia is one of his "top picks" among semiconductor stocks, he said in a note to clients.


Nvidia has posted accelerating sales growth for the past two quarters thanks to strong demand for graphics processors for gaming PCs and data centers.


It also could be getting a near-term lift from graphics processing units being used for cryptocurrency mining. Bitcoin is trading near record-high levels. However, GPUs are in short supply.


Elevated Bitcoin prices will "create a near-term demand driver that will soak up any excess supply of GPUs," Bradley Gastwirth, chief technology strategist for Wedbush Securities, said in his note to clients Monday.


NVDA Stock Ranks Third In Its Group
-----------------------------------


Nvidia ranks third out of 31 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-corp-nvda.aspx) tool. But that group ranks just No. 107 of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.


NVDA stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


However, it has a so-so [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 71 out of 99.Â The Relative Strength Rating shows how a stock's price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks.


Also, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for NVDA stock is trending lower as it lags the S&P 500 index.

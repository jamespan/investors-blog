Tyler Stock: Public Safety Business Growing
-------------------------------------------


Tyler's second-quarter adjusted profit rose 19% to $2.41 a share. Revenue rose 7% to $541 million.


Tyler has been public since 1966. It shifted its focus to the public sector software market in 1997.


Acquisitions have been a big part of its growth strategy. Since 1998, it has completed roughly 60 acquisitions.


More recently, the company has focused on the public safety sector, noted Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne in a report.


"Public safety momentum is growing and having a network effect with their sixth state police agency win," Materne said in a review of Q2 earnings. "With only 12% penetration of state police agencies we believe there is ample room to grow."

Oppenheimer analyst Ken Wong said payments software has been a source of strength with both customer adoption and transactional volumes tracking ahead of expectations.


"Tyler is seeing good momentum with payments and is the component of its business that has the most upside relative to its long-term outlook," Wong said in a report. "Payments have been responsible for outperformance so far in 2024."

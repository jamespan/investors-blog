Sea Stock More Than Doubles
---------------------------


Since its IPO, the stock has more than doubled. On the [stock market today,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) Sea stock climbed 3.2% to 38.83, after hitting a record high of 39.20 earlier in the session. The stock moved into a buy range that starts with the 38.10 buy point on Nov. 20. That buy range caps out at 40. The pattern was a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/).


The company says it has both the largest digital entertainment platform and the largest e-commerce operation in the Southeast Asia region, comprised of Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. The region has a population of about 585 million people. Its market reach extends to Latin America.


On the digital entertainment side, Sea operates one of the most popular online gaming platforms in the region, called Garena. Its services include online mobile games and esports. The company says its free mobile game called Free Fire, "recently joined the $1 billion club as one of the highest-grossing mobile games in the world."


"We are convinced that the huge popularity of Free Fire worldwide gives us an opportunity to build a long-lasting franchise around this intellectual property," Chief Executive Forrest Li said during the company's third-quarter earnings conference call.


Its digital entertainment business ended the third quarter with 321.1 million active users, up 82% from the year-ago period. Quarterly paying users accounted for 9% of the user total, up from 4%.


"Our strategy goal for Garena for this year has been to enhance our position as the leading global game developer and publisher, to extend our global footprint and to translate this into sustainable success," Li said.


A Leading E-Commerce Platform
-----------------------------


The total e-commerce market in Southeast Asia is expected to hit gross merchandise volume of $153 billion by 2025, from $38.2 billion this year. That's according to a report from Google and Temasek.


The company's e-commerce site is called Shopee. For [its third quarter](https://cdngarenanow-a.akamaihd.net/webmain/static/resource/seagroup/press/2019-11-12%20Sea%20Third%20Quarter%202019%20Results%20.pdf), Sea reported a 70% rise in Shopee gross merchandise volume to $4.6 billion.


According to research firm App Annie, Shopee was the leading e-commerce platform in both Southeast Asia and Taiwan by average monthly active users. Its e-commerce adjusted revenue in the third quarter was $257.2 million, up 261% year-on-year


The company reported an adjusted loss of 60 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of 70 cents, when it released third-quarter earnings on Nov. 12. Revenue jumped 198% from the year-ago period to $610.1 million. That's an acceleration from growth of 137% in the second quarter.


On an adjusted basis, it said revenue jumped 214% to $763.3 million from the year-ago period, also beating estimates.


It's unclear when the company will reach profitability, though its losses are decreasing. Three analysts polled by Yahoo Finance see a loss of 17 cents a share from the company for the fourth quarter, down from 95 cents a year ago, with at least one seeing profitability during the period.


An Outperform Rating On Sea Stock
---------------------------------


Cowen analyst John Blackledge, however, doesn't think Sea will turn the corner on profitability until 2021. After that, though, he estimates the company's annual profits will grow sharply through 2024, when they will reach $4.96 a share. Blackledge has a rating of outperform and price target of 43 on Sea stock.


"We believe Sea's market leadership in both online mobile gaming and e-commerce in the rapidly growing Southeast Asian market should drive value creation over the long term," Blackledge said in a recent note to clients.


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-inc-tsla.aspx) shows that Sea has anÂ [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 76 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Sea stock currently outperforms 76% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria


It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 98 out of 99. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the past 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


It has a weak [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1) of 34, which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth with all other stocks.

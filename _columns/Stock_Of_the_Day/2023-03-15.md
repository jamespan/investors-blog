**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the provider of cybersecurity software used by businesses to build firewalls, intrusion detection systems and antivirus programs is helping companies protect their valuable data. FTNT stock is nearing a buy point.




FTNT stock continues to consolidate after shares gapped up in reaction to [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ftnt-stock-fortinet-earnings-fortinet-stock-q42022/) on Feb. 7. During the quarter, revenue climbed 33% from the year-ago quarter to $1.28 billion, just below analyst views. Adjusted earnings came in at 44 cents a share, up 76%. That beat estimates, as did billings.


FTNT stock has been in a consolidation that now shows a 63.12 buy point. Also, the company's [relative strength line](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/) is at its highest level since mid-July. The stock has gotten support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) the past few weeks and is close to forming a flat base.


Shares were down 1.6% Wednesday to 59.94 in afternoon action.


One way to find the [best stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sp500-beating-lists-find-next-apple-amazon/) during a choppy market is to look at their [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/). It compares a stock's performance with that of the S&P 500. When the RS line is climbing, this means the stock is outperforming the benchmark index.

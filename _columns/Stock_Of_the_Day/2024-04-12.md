South Korean e-commerce company **Coupang** ([CPNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPNG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Coupang stock broke out from a cup-with-handle base Friday following news that the company would increase the price for its membership program.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Coupang stock rose 11.5% to close at 21.25. With the gap-up, shares broke out above a 19.78 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/mstool). The gains continued a strong start to the year in which Coupang is up nearly 30%.


Founded in 2010, Coupang is South Korea's largest e-commerce company. The company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.


Coupang Stock: Rising On Higher Fees
------------------------------------


The apparent catalyst for Coupang's jump on Friday is its plan to charge a higher monthly fee for its Wow membership. The company announced the change through a news release Friday in Korea. The fee will increase to 7,890 won ($5.70) per month from its previous 4,990 won ($3.61), according to the [Korea Times.](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/04/419_372576.html)


The new pricing begins on April 13 for new members and in August for current ones. Similar to Prime membership from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Coupang members get free shipping, access to Coupang's streaming network and free food delivery, among other perks.


Coupang said in its news release that it will "continue to expand its exclusive benefits for Wow members such as free shipping, free returns, unlimited OTT (over-the-top) service and free food delivery," according to a translation from the Korea Times. The news report noted, however, that some users have voiced displeasure online with the change.


The company's Wow membership had more than 14 million paying members as of the end of 2023, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings statement. Membership grew 27% last year.


Coupang Stock: Operating Profit In 2023
---------------------------------------


With initial backing from Japan-based investment company Softbank, Coupang has invested significant resources to enable same-day delivery in the country. Coupang went public through an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coupang-ipo-initial-public-offering-trades-thursday-korea-cpng-amzn-baba/) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.


Coupang stock surged following the company's [fourth-quarter earnings report](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coupangs-stock-rallies-on-stronger-than-expected-profit-and-revenue-08b76a08) in late February. Revenue increased 23% to $6.6 billion, ahead of consensus.


For all of 2023, Coupang reported revenue of $24.4 billion, up 18% from a year earlier. Notably, the company reported operating income of $473 million, compared to a $112 million operating loss in 2022 and $1.5 billion operating loss in 2021.


In 2022, the company opened a global headquarters in Seattle, where Amazon is also based.


Growing Competition
-------------------


Coupang is facing fierce competition. The price hike for Wow membership comes as China-based **PDD Holdings** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) are each looking to grow in South Korea, a Korea Times report noted.


Coupang itself is expanding. The firm said last summer that it would [ramp up investments](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/coupang-to-ramp-up-investment-in-taiwan-after-four-quarters-of-profits/) in Taiwan. On the other hand, Coupang last year [ceased operations](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/korean-e-commerce-firm-coupang-082457084.html) in Japan after two years.


The company recently [paid $500 million](https://ir.aboutcoupang.com/English/news-and-events/news/news-details/2024/Coupang-Completes-Acquisition-of-Farfetch/default.aspx) to acquire U.K.-based luxury goods e-commerce platform Farfetch, which was once valued at more than $20 billion through a private investment round as a startup.


There are 16 analysts following Coupang stock, according to FactSet. Of those analysts, 10 give Coupang a buy or equivalent rating, while five have a hold rating and one considers Coupang a sell.


For 2024, analysts project that Coupang's sales will rise 18% to $28.75 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected to tick up to 28 cents per share for the year, from 26 cents per share last year, according to FactSet analyst consensus.

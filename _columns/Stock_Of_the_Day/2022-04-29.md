PSX stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the oil refiner flirts with a buy point after reporting earnings, and with global fuel demand surging amid the Russia-Ukraine war.




**Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)) refines, stores, transports and markets fuel and related products. On Friday, PSX easily beat first-quarter earnings and sales estimates, bolstering hopes for a continued turnaround.


In addition, the Dallas-based company announced plans to restart share repurchases. PSX suspended stock buybacks in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Return To Share Buybacks After Pandemic
---------------------------------------


"We believe current market conditions will allow us to increase shareholder returns by restarting share repurchases and increasing the dividend," Phillips 66 CEO Greg Garland said in the April 29 earnings release.


"We are progressing a transformation effort to improve the cost structure across the enterprise," he added. Besides cutting costs, management has been slashing debt.


Peer **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) also beat earnings estimates earlier this week. Next week, **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) should also report a big profit. On Friday, oil majors **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) [both posted big profit and revenue jumps for the first quarter but missed elevated earnings expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-stocks-exxon-chevron-earnings-crude-oil-prices/).


Oil Prices At $100 Level After Surge
------------------------------------


[Oil prices are generally holding above $100](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-stocks-exxon-chevron-earnings-crude-oil-prices/), trading up 45% since the start of year. The West, Europe in particular, turned away from purchases of Russian oil after the Feb. 24 Ukraine invasion.


Some analysts had projected the price of a barrel of oil would skyrocket to $200. But Covid-19 lockdowns in China, the biggest importer of crude oil, continue to weigh on its economy and manufacturing. As a result, suppliers are better able to meet demand.


West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell as low as $95 a barrel on Monday, and closed just above $105 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Brent crude fell to around $100 on Monday, but rebounded to about $108 on Wednesday.


PSX Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------


Shares of Phillips 66 pared early gains to 0.9%, trading at 87.97 on the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) The stock bounced off its 50-day moving average Thursday.

**Textainer Group Holdings** ([TGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as soaring container demand lifts TGH stock past buy range.




The Bermuda-based company is one of the world's largest lessors of shipping containers with 250 customers, including the U.S. military.


Shipping came into focus when the Ever Given ship was stuck in the Suez Canal in March. But a shipping container shortage has been building for months, and analysts see it lasting until 2022.


The problem is that the unexpected boom in consumer spending that began last year boosted demand for containers. And on the supply side, container producers were caught flat-footed as they thought demand would stay weak after orders vanished in early 2020.


They have since ramped up production but not enough to keep up with all the exports and imports of electronics, home furnishings and toys people are buying. Delays at ports are also keeping containers occupied for longer. As a result, prices have soared in recent months.


Textainer has benefited from the surge in demand. Earlier this month, CEO Olivier Ghesquiere said that in Q1, 99.6% of its containers were leased out, and the company is investing in new containers.

**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker soared to a record high after delivering better-than-expected third-quarter results. Inphi stock gapped up Wednesday on its results.




The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company posted September-quarter earnings late Tuesday. [Inphi earned](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inphi-earnings-q3-2019-inphi-stock/) an adjusted 45 cents a share on sales of $94.2 million in the September quarter. Analysts expected it to earn 37 cents a share on sales of $89 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. On a year-over-year basis, Inphi earnings jumped 50% while sales climbed 21%.


For the current quarter, Inphi expects to earn 45 cents a share on sales of $99.8 million. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling Inphi earnings of 42 cents a share on sales of $96 million in the December quarter, Zacks said. In the year-earlier period, Inphi earned 45 cents a share on sales of $86.5 million.


Inphi stock jumped 17.3% to 69.71 in morning trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). In early trading, it notched an all-time high of 72.31, clearing a nearly three-week base.


Shares gave back some gains in midday trading Wednesday. Investors who are still considering buying Inphi stock are better off waiting until the stock can rise back above the 72.31 high.

Inphi Stock Rebounds From Failed Breakout
-----------------------------------------


On July 1, Inphi stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) and surged more than 20% within a few weeks. It started consolidating in mid-July, a move which lasted until Tuesday.


Inphi makes high-speed data movement chips for cloud data centers and communications systems.


Inphi stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-inphi-corp-iphi.aspx) tool. That means it has outperformed 92% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Its relative strength line is reaching new highs in a bullish sign. Inphi's [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is now 95 out of a possible 99.


Inphi ranks No. 2 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. The top stock in the group is **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)), which is being acquired by **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


The fabless chip group ranks No. 95 out of 197 industry groups. Three months ago, it ranked No. 23. Sentiment has turned more negative recently on mixed third-quarter earnings reports from chipmakers.


Inphi Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes
-----------------------------------


Needham analyst Quinn Bolton on Wednesday kept his buy rating on Inphi stock and raised his price target to 72 from 65.


Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his buy rating and upped his price target to 79 from 72.


"We think its product cycle and exposure to secular demand trends for data center and telecom bandwidth will trump headwinds from semiconductor cycle and geopolitical tensions," Lipacis said in a note to clients.

Upscale furniture chain **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). RH stock is in a base, with recent chart action offering investors an early buy point.




Housing-related stocks, from homebuilders to suppliers to retailers such as RH, are moving higher again as the housing and home-renovation market remains strong.


RH Stock
--------


RH stock rose 2.3% to 676.08 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), bouncing off its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/)Â but off intraday highs of 694.99.


The stock is in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 724.11 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But the move off the 50-day line, along with breaking a downtrend in the handle, offers an early entry.


RH tried to break out from a previous handle in early July, but that move quickly fizzled, developing into the current handle.


RH stock has a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 98. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is not far off highs reached in April, but not great. The RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



Housing Market Holds Up
-----------------------


The furniture chain, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, last year benefited from more wealthier customers stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic who looked to restyle their homes.


RH reported first-quarter results in June that beat estimates. For the second quarter, RH forecast sales growth of 35% to 37%, above Wall Street forecasts at the time. And the company raised its full fiscal-year sales-growth outlook to 25% to 30%, compared to earlier expectations for 15% to 20%.


CEO Gary Friedman, during the RH earnings call in June, said that the fiscal year would likely be "a tale of two halves." But he was upbeat about the second half of the year and the year to follow.


He pointed to "a strong housing and renovation market both with pent-up demand and a long tail, a record stock market, low interest rates and the reopening of several large parts of our economy." RH stock jumped after the report.


Since then, however, coronavirus cases have surged in the U.S. Many people remain hesitant to get vaccinated.


The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ([XHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XHB)), whose holdings include RH stock, was the [IBD Stock of the Day on Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/housing-stocks-play-in-buy-range-as-home-depot-lennar-floor-and-decor-rebound/). XHB dipped 1.1% to 75.70. The ETF is in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with an 80.92 buy point. But investors could take an early entry from the 50-day/10-week line.

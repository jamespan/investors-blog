**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Late Thursday, Starbucks earnings easily beat quarterly estimates. Starbucks stock gapped up toward a buy point Friday. Several other restaurant stocks are acting bullishly, including **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and Dow Jones component **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).




Coffee giant Starbucks operates more than 29,000 cafes worldwide, and offers a range of beverages and food items. It is also renowned for its strong loyalty program and forays into digital ordering.


Late Thursday, Starbucks posted strong fiscal Q1 results. Starbucks earnings rose 15% while same-store sales grew 4% worldwide. The coffee chain also lifted full-year profit guidance largely above consensus views.


The one bitter note from the report was China same-store sales, up just 1% vs. a year earlier. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson expressed confidence in the chain's China prospects.

Starbucks Earnings Perk Up Analysts
-----------------------------------


Wells Fargo managing director Bonnie Herzog was buzzing following the latest Starbucks earnings report. She reiterated her outperform valuation on Starbucks Stock and 73 price target on "continued momentum."


"We think (the) results should start to put to rest investor skepticism that SBUX will be able to hit its recently updated [long-term] growth targets (incl. 3-4% comp growth and 'at least' 10% EPS growth)," the analyst said in a research note. "All-in, we continue to believe SBUX's [long-term] growth algorithm is doable/realistic given its traffic-driving initiatives and robust capital allocation plan."


Herzog highlighted the firm's strong execution of multiple initiatives in the U.S., its huge potential to become an international powerhouse due to its China and Asia Pacific segment, its "best-in-class" loyalty programs and digital offerings and potential from its mobile order and pay platform.


Meanwhile, CFRA Research analyst Tuna Amobi, who maintains a hold valuation on Starbucks stock with a 68 target, was optimistic on the potential of the firm's latest synergy moves.


"We are cautiously optimistic on a new partnership in China with Alibaba, and a global strategic licensing pact with Nestle, which recently raised about $5B of upfront proceeds for share buybacks," he said in a research note.

**Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the largest egg producer in the U.S. continues to record strong growth even as a bird flu outbreak has decimated chicken flocks in 2022. CALM shares edged lower Friday.




Cal-Maine stock competitors include Mexico-based **Industrias Bachoco** ([IBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBA)), **VitalFarms** ([VITL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VITL)) and **Pilgrim's** **Pride** ([PPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPC)).


After just scraping by during the pandemic's early years, the Mississippi-based egg producer and supplier sold a record 1.1 billion dozen shell eggs in fiscal 2022, up 1% from the previous year. Cal-Maine's revenue surged 30% to $1.8 billion for the year, in line with the rise in average selling price per dozen eggs.


However, the company's production costs rose 21% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by the rising price of feed, corn and soybean meal stemming from the Russian war against Ukraine.


The egg-production industry has also been dealing with an outbreak of bird flu throughout 2022. The avian influenza has spread through chicken and turkey flocks in 46 states since it was first detected in Indiana on Feb. 8.


The bird flu outbreak has been responsible for nearly 53 million chicken deaths, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with some animals falling sick while other flocks have been culled.


In fiscal year 2022, Cal-Maine reported that about 9.5% of its egg-laying flock was affected, compared to 11.4% during the 2014-2015 outbreak.


The reduced supply has sent egg prices skyrocketing, fueling a recovery in earnings and sales growth, according to analysts.

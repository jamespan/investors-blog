**Freshworks** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Tuesday, as FRSH stock approaches a buy point from a cup-with-handle base. FRSH stock has gained more than 40% this year.




Freshworks is an enterprise software company with offerings such as IT services management and customer resource management software. It competes with giants such as **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), among others. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company reported its first adjusted operating profit in the first quarter of this year.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), FRSH stock rose 3.5% to close at 21.24. Shares are nearing a 21.50 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) buy point.


FRSH Stock: Earnings Growth
---------------------------


FRSH stock has gained about 17% since Freshworks' Oct. 31 [third-quarter earnings report](https://ir.freshworks.com/news-releases/news-release-details/freshworks-reports-third-quarter-2023-results). The company reported adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share and sales of $154 million, exceeding analyst expectations for both numbers. Earnings jumped from a one-cent loss for the same period last year, while sales grew 19%.


"We think 3Q results reflect FRSH's resiliency in the face of a tough macro and its continued execution on its more profitable growth strategy," Barclays analyst Ryan MacWilliams said in a note to clients following the report. He holds a neutral equal-weight rating for the stock.


For the full year, analysts expect Freshworks to post adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share, compared with an adjusted 7-cent loss last year. Further, revenue is expected to grow 20% to $595 million.


In the first quarter, Freshworks reported an adjusted operating profit of $3.9 million, its first operating profit as a public company.


AI Offerings

In June, Freshworks announced upgrades to its Freddy AI software that integrates generative artificial intelligence to help with a range of business tasks.


"Our goal at Freshworks is to put the power of generative AI in the hands of the Fortune five million, not just the Fortune 500 enterprise," founder and Chief Executive Girish Mathrubootham said in the June [news release.](https://www.freshworks.com/freshworks-unveils-new-generative-ai-enhancements-across-product-lines-to-power-greater-business-efficiency/)

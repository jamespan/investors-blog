HubSpot is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the seller of digital marketing software breaks out above a 180.10 flat-base entry point. HubSpot stock hit an all-time high Monday.




In addition, HubSpot earnings are due May 7 after the market close. To lower risk, one way to play HubSpot earnings might be to use an [options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/).


One reason for caution is that HubSpot stock pulled back after it reported fourth-quarter earnings in early February. Shares were clawing their way out of a consolidation, then popped on Feb. 13 after earnings and revenue topped expectations. But HubSpot did not hold its big gain in intraday trading that day and closed down a fraction.

Shares then went into a flat base before breaking out Monday. The stock ended the day up 2.6% at 183.39


HubSpot Expanding Product Portfolio
-----------------------------------


"HubSpot released its definitive proxy statement," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Terry Tillman said in a report to clients Monday. "We are excited by the company's much broader revenue-generating growth software stack."


Tillman added: "We view the expanded product set as a key driver in sustaining strong growth and upside performance."


Cambridge, Mass.-based HubSpot sells sales and marketing software to small and midsize businesses. It focuses on digital channels such as blogs, internet search engines and social media.


One bullish signal for HubSpot stock is that its weekly [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at a new high.


HubSpot stock also has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 98 out of a possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge the strengths of a company's stock.


HubSpot Takes On Salesforce.com, Zendesk
----------------------------------------


In the high end of the market, HubSpot competes against **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)).


HubSpot aims to attract people to customer websites and optimize content so that visitors are converted into paying customers. The company recently has expanded beyond marketing into sales automation and customer relationship management products, or CRM.


In the CRM market, HubSpot also competes with **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)).


"Although much has been made about the move upmarket for HubSpot and the resulting competitive implications, we believe the primary reason for the move upmarket is not to land customers that are similar in size to Salesforce's customers, but rather to land customers early on and grow with them over time," William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri said in a recent note to clients.


More than 40% of HubSpot's revenue is generated from multiproduct customers. HubSpot in December expanded its ties to Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com**. ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). AWS is the biggest provider of cloud-computing services. HubSpot's marketing software has been hosted on AWS' cloud platform for several years.

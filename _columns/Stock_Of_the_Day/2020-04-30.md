Coronavirus Crisis Shows Value Of ServiceNow Products
-----------------------------------------------------


Late Wednesday, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company posted [first-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-stock-servicenow-earnings-q12020-coronavirus/) that delighted investors. It earned an adjusted $1.05 a share on sales of $1.046 billion. Analysts were looking for ServiceNow earnings of 95 cents a share on sales of $1.02 billion for the period ended March 31.


On a year-over-year basis, ServiceNow earnings rose 57% while sales climbed 33%. It was the company's fastest earnings growth in five quarters.


The coronavirus pandemic has shown the value of ServiceNow's products, Chief Executive Bill McDermott said in a [news release](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results.html).


"This pandemic has allowed us to engage our customers in new ways, enabling them to focus on their most critical workflows," McDermott said. "Businesses are splitting apart old value chains and reassembling them in end‑to‑end, mobile‑first experiences on the Now Platform. Our Q1 results are a direct reflection of ServiceNow's unique position as the workflow platform to create great employee and customer experiences — even in these challenging conditions."


ServiceNow makes information-technology service management software. Its self-service tech portal enables company employees to access administrative and workflow tools.

Some Customers Accelerating Digital Transformation
--------------------------------------------------


ServiceNow stock received a bunch of price-target hikes from Wall Street analysts after the company's first-quarter report.


Raymond James analyst Michael Turits reiterated his strong buy rating on ServiceNow stock and upped his price target to 385 from 330.


"The company continued to see strong momentum in the business even through the end of March and with April linearity trending better than last year," Turits said in a note to clients. "While some customers pushed off ServiceNow projects as they focused on remote access with Covid, others actually accelerated digital transformation in response to disruptions in their business."


However, ServiceNow could be hurt by a recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Turits said. About 20% of ServiceNow business is from companies in industries disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus crisis, he said. Those industries include transportation, hospitality, retail and energy.

**KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Thursday. KBH stock is building toward a buy point and trading near a 16-year high.




Homebuilders have rallied aggressively this year, as rising interest rates have slowed sales of existing homes, driving demand and prices for newbuilt homes. The [Building-Residential/Commercial industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/understanding-the-link-between-industry-groups-and-institutional-investors/) bolted nearly 42% so far in 2023.


KBH stock ranks fifth in the group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Jacksonville, Fla.-based **Dream Finders Homes** ([DFH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFH)) leads the group. Rivals **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) have sailed nearly 40% higher for the year.


**PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) has soared 83% so far in 2023 and **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) has rallied 57%.


Data from the National Association of Realtors showed new home sales dropped in June, following a surge during the month of May. But prices remained strong and demand steady as high mortgage rates left owners of existing homes sitting tight — not wanting to sell and move up into more expensive mortgages.


July's new home sales data is due on Aug. 23.


Meanwhile, housing prices rose 0.4% month-over-month in both June and July, according to the Aug. 10 CPI report. The bump in home prices accounted for more than 90% of the overall CPI increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted.


KB Home easily beat forecasts for its Q2 results from June 21. Earnings fell 16.4% to $1.94 per share, but were well above estimates for $1.33 per share. Revenue rose 3% to $1.77 billion. FactSet analysts expected $1.43 billion in revenue.


Its average selling price declined 3% to $479,500. But net orders rose 1%, marking a significant improvement to the 49% year-over-year dive in Q1.


For the year, KB Home raised its housing revenue forecast to $5.8 billion-$6.2 billion, from $5.2 billion-$5.9 billion. KB Home expects an average home selling price of $485,000.

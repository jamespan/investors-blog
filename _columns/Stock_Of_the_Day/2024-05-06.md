**Modine Manufacturing** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the heating and air conditioning (HVAC) play rallied along with peers Monday, offering investors early entries to an official buy point.




The Wisconsin-based HVAC company is expected to see fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings grow 13% to 76 cents per share even as revenue is forecast to decline 2% to $605 million. Modine should report fiscal fourth-quarter financials in late May. Meanwhile, analysts see full fiscal year profit increasing 66% and continue to grow another 30% by 2026.


Part of this growth is due to the demand surge for artificial intelligence (AI) and the data centers needed to train and deploy machine learning. The high heat generated from these facilities have upped demand for cooling products.


"We are experiencing rapid sales growth to the data center market, supported by robust demand from both hyperscale and collocation customers," Modine Chief Executive Officer Neil Brinker said at the end of the fiscal third quarter in January.


The company saw sales for data center cooling, HVAC and refrigeration products grow more than 30% in fiscal Q3. For the full fiscal year, the company predicts revenue from data centers will grow 60%-70%.

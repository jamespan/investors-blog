**Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Chinese online retailer easily beat Wall Street's estimates for the fourth quarter. Vipshop stock jumped into a buy range on the news.




Founded in 2008, Vipshop is a leading online discount retailer. It offers more than 29,000 domestic and international brands that appeal to urban, fashion-oriented and value-conscious consumers.


The company ended 2019 with 69 million active customers, up 14% from the prior year. It reported [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vipshop-earnings-q4-vips-stock/) Thursday that handily topped Wall Street estimates.


Vipshop stock rocketed 27% to 16.66 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Vipshop stock broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 15.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The [5% chase zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) extended to 15.82. But remember, the stock market correction makes any new stock purchases much riskier.

Before the market open Thursday, Vipshop reported adjusted earnings of 41 cents a share, beating the consensus estimate of 29 cents. Revenue climbed 12% to $4.21 billion, topping views of $4 billion.


Impact From Covid-19 Outbreak
-----------------------------


For the first quarter, Vipshop sees revenue in the range of $2.46 billion to $2.6 billion, which would be a 15%-20% decline from the year-ago period, "primarily factoring in the short-term impact from the novel coronavirus outbreak," according to the [Vipshop earnings release](http://ir.vip.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vipshop-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019).


"Although our business is experiencing some short-term impact from the novel coronavirus outbreak, we are fully confident in the long-term potential of the Chinese economy and the growth opportunities in China's discount retail segment," Chief Executive Eric Shen said in written remarks.


The company managed $6.86 billion in gross merchandise volume in the quarter, up 14%. Apparel-related categories contributed more than 70% of its total GMV.


"Going forward, we will continue to balance our top and bottom line, investing to grow our business while maintaining healthy margins," Chief Financial Officer Donghao Yang said.


China E-Commerce Competitors
----------------------------


In the e-commerce field, Vipshop competitors include **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)).


In December 2017, **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) [invested $863 million in Vipshop](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vipshop-soars-on-863-million-investment-from-tencent-jd-com/). The announcement caused Vipshop stock to soar.


Tencent, China's leader in online messaging and gaming, invested $604 million and received a 7% stake in Vipshop. JD.com, a leading e-commerce retailer that competes most directly against Alibaba, invested $259 million for a 5.5% stake.


The deal was seen as an attempt to defend against Alibaba, China's leading provider of e-commerce services. JD.com and Tencent also have a partnership.


JD.com reported [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-earnings-revenue-edge-forecasts-stock-climbs/) on Monday that were better than expected. Alibaba reported [expectation-beating results](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/alibaba-earnings-q3-2020-alibaba-stock/) last month.

**Acadia Healthcare** ([ACHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACHC)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the country's leading provider of behavioral health services holds firm in an uncertain market.




ACHC stock pulled back following an early jump in Tuesday' [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-market-rally-extends-gains-how-aggressive-should-you-be/), teasing a pair of early entries within a bullish base pattern.

Acadia's six-week cup shows a standard buy point of 76.79, according to [weekly MarketSmith charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). That buy point is 10 cents above its 52-week high ofÂ  76.69, chalked up on April 20.


The cup base sits atop a much longer pattern, which formed from September to April. The stock broke out decisively from that base, then pulled back to form a second pattern perched atop the earlier base's highs.

**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as its shares approach a buy point ahead of the software company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report next week. Adobe stock fell on Monday during an overall down day for the market.




The San Jose, Calif.-based company plans to report its fourth-quarter results after the market close on Dec. 12. Analysts expect the maker of digital media and marketing software to earn $2.26 a share on sales of $2.98 billion. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 23.5% in earnings and 21% in sales.


Over the past 20 weeks, Adobe stock has formed a third-stage [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 313.21, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Adobe stock fell 2.2% to close at 302.75.


Adobe stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 80, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-adobe-inc-adbe.aspx). The best growth stocks typically have RS Ratings of at least 80. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-rs-line-gives-clues-about-a-stocks-weakening-health/) sank Monday as Adobe stock has lost ground vs. the performance of the S&P 500.

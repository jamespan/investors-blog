**Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. The Virginia-based insurance firm is nearing a buy point ahead of its earnings report next week. KNSL stock hit a 52-week high on Tuesday.




Kinsale Capital focuses on excess and surplus (E&S) insurance. This type of specialty insurance covers higher-risk businesses, exposures and policies that traditional insurance doesn't cover.


The firm has performed well over the past two years. Kinsale posted strong earnings and revenue growth since Q2 of 2020. However, revenue gains slowed to 17% from 30% last quarter and earnings growth ticked up to 50% from 47%.


There's been more favorable assumptions around insurance premium growth and expenses, according to a research note from Truist analyst Mark Hughes. Meanwhile, Kinsale has a favorable competitive environment as its rivals struggle with rising losses and deteriorating revenues, he wrote.


For the third-quarter results on Oct. 27, analysts expect Kinsale's earnings to fall roughly 19% to $1.28 per share, according to the FactSet consensus. Revenue is seen rising 30% to $216 million.


Buying stocks before earnings results can be risky. Results that miss analyst forecasts could cause unexpected price swings. In addition, investors should be building watchlists, rather than buying into new positions, until the stock market confirms a new uptrend.

KNSL stock is trading in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 285.36 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares briefly eclipsed the buy point on Tuesday after hitting a 52-week high of $285.66, but have since pulled back.

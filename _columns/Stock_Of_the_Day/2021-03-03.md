**Flagstar Bancorp** ([FBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBC)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with several quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. FBC stock is in a base but flashed early buy signals.




Shares of the Michigan-based savings and loan company have run higher over the past year, helped by its large mortgage business amid a strong housing market. FBC stock has higher ratings than big bank stocks.

Flagstar Earnings Booming
-------------------------


And no wonder. Flagstar Bancorp earnings have surged 183% to 250% in the last three quarters. Revenue growth also has been hot.


Flagstar Bank has 158 branches across Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio and California. The company also originates and offers home loans through a nationwide broker network. FBC stock has run higher over the past year, after crashing initially due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.


Sixty-two percent of Flagstar's revenue last year came from its mortgage origination segment, which generates and sells residential mortgages. Around 12% comes from servicing fee revenue.


The company draws a large portion of its mortgage sales from government-backed mortgage financing giants like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Flagstar's business with those organizations largely comes from gains on the sale of single-family residential loans.


In its annual report, filed last month, the company warned that changes in loan programs offered by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie could harm business. It also said that if interest rates like the 10-year Treasury rate rise, mortgage originations might decrease.


Mortgage applications have cooled in recent weeks due to rising rates.


Wall Street expects Flagstar earnings to fall 20% in 2021 and 28% in 2022.


Legislation related to the coronavirus pandemic has also forced the company to provide mortgage forbearances. Flagstar also waived customer fees during the early part of the pandemic, and said it might do so in the future.


"This could result in a reduction in servicing fee income and a higher cost to service," the annual report said.

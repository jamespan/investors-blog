**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) stock shot up on Friday after an upbeat second-quarter earnings report. The stock gapped out of a first-stage base, which means it can still be bought even though it's above the conventional buy range.




Autodesk rocketed 15.3% to 157.20 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It had formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a buy point of 143.04 over the past 10 weeks. But investors can buy the [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/), treating the opening price — in this case 152.39 — as the entry point. In intraday trading, Autodesk hit a record high of 157.78.


Autodesk also is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


The maker of computer-aided design, or CAD, software reported late Thursday better-than-expected results for its fiscal second quarter ended July 31. It earned an adjusted 19 cents a share on sales of $612 million in the period. Analysts expected it to earn 16 cents a share on sales of $600.3 million. In the year-earlier period, Autodesk lost 11 cents a share on sales of $501.8 million.

[Autodesk had its second quarter](http://investors.autodesk.com/static-files/742974ef-56da-44aa-87e9-8a7435e17a71) in a row of profitability following its transition to a cloud computing-based subscription business model from licensed software. That transition had depressed earnings and revenue for several quarters. Sales growth accelerated to 22%, vs. 15% in the prior quarter, for the fastest gain in at least 20 quarters.


For the current quarter, Autodesk expects to earn an adjusted 26 cents a share on sales of $640 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling it to earn 28 cents a share on sales of $634.2 million in the October quarter.


CAD Software Stocks Hot
-----------------------


Autodesk is the second maker of CAD software to see its shares leap past a buy zone on quarterly results in as many days. The same thing happened to **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) on Thursday.


At least 12 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on Autodesk stock after the earnings report. Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda was among the most bullish. He reiterated his outperform rating on Autodesk and increased his price target to 175 from 150.


Key metrics for Autodesk, such as annualized recurring revenue and average revenue per subscriber, accelerated in the quarter, Ikeda said in a report. Those positive metrics lend support that "the model transition is working," he said.


In particular, the company's tools for architecture, engineering and construction showed accelerating growth last quarter. That indicates "the digital replatforming wave in the construction industry is gaining steam and the category is strategic for the business's future growth," he said.

S&P 500 component **Brown & Brown** ([BRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRO)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the insurance broker homes in on a buy point with analysts predicting another year of profit and revenue growth.


Brown & Brown is the sixth-largest independent insurance brokerage in the U.S. The Daytona Beach, Fla.-based company offers personal insurance lines â€” including home, auto, recreational vehicle and flood coverage. In October 2024, the company announced it [acquired assets from The Canopy Group](https://investor.bbinsurance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/brown-brown-inc-acquires-assets-canopy-group), which specializes in personal lines and commercial property and casualty for small businesses in Minnesota.




The insurance broker on Jan. 27 closed the book on 2024 with better-than-expected Q4 earnings and revenue. The S&P 500 company saw quarterly profit grow 48% with sales increasing 14.5%. Analysts expect 2025 both earnings and revenue to expand 9%, according to FactSet.


Meanwhile, insurance giant **Progressive** ([PGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGR)) on Wednesday announced its January results. William Blair analyst Adam Klauber noted that Progressive's January sales suggest the company is "well on its way" to 2025 EPS coming in above $15, with "greater upside potential." Analyst consensus pegs Progressive 2025 profit coming in at $14.51, representing 3% growth vs. 2024, according to FactSet.


"Despite Progressive having a very strong run in 2024, January results indicate that there is room for further growth in 2025," Klauber wrote Wednesday.

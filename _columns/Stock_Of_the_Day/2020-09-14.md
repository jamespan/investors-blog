**Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the Canadian gold producer broke out into a buy zone. Agnico led the charge among gold stocks ahead of this week's potentially pivotal Federal Reserve meeting.




On Monday, IBD added Agnico stock to its [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) portfolio, a group of elite stocks primed to outperform the broad stock market.


Agnico stock rose 5.2%, but moves were more muted for other gold stocks. **Newmont** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) rose 1.75%, **Franco-Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)) added 1.6% and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) advanced 3.45%.


Monday's rise came as the spot gold price rose 0.9% to $1,958 per ounce, as the dollar softened vs. other currencies. The spot gold price still hasn't reclaimed last month's record high near $2,070. But December gold rose 0.8% to $1,963.70, the best gain this month.


Federal Reserve Meeting Key For Gold Stocks
-------------------------------------------


On Aug. 27, the Fed announced a new policy to target a 2% average inflation rate. The policy essentially commits the Federal Reserve to refrain from monetary tightening until inflation is north of that target.


That should be fuel for the gold price and good news for gold stocks, which tend to rise when real interest rates are negative. Negative real interest rates mean there's no opportunity cost to holding gold vs. investing that money safely in Treasuries.


Yet Wall Street's initial reaction to the Fed's adoption of an average inflation target was to push the 10-year Treasury yield to 0.75%, a two-month high. The implication: Financial markets are beginning to prepare for the possibility that the Fed will succeed in lifting inflation. Progress toward a coronavirus vaccine also could move long-term rates higher, even as the Fed remains committed to hold its benchmark overnight lending rate near zero.


That's why this week's Fed meeting matters so much. The path of least resistance for long-term Treasuries now appears to be higher. The big question: What will the Fed do to resist that path?


A logical policy response that could be announced as early as Wednesday would be to direct the Fed's purchases of Treasuries, about $8 billion per day, to the long end of the Treasury yield curve. That would help hold down long-term rates, a positive for economic growth â€” and for gold stocks.


A more aggressive step in this direction would involve an increase in Fed asset purchases, but that would come as a surprise. While certainly on the table, the Fed may prefer to wait until the 10-year yield pushes closer to 1%. Policymakers also might prefer to wait until after Election Day.


Gold bugs expecting the yellow metal to keep hitting new records are hoping for aggressive efforts to revive inflation while the Fed intervenes to hold down long-term rates.

Agnico Eagle Business Momentum
------------------------------


Agnico Eagle Mines summarized its Aug. 10 business update this way: "Back on Track and Expecting a Strong Second Half 2020."


The gold miner saw significant disruptions in operations at seven of eight mines due to the coronavirus in the first half. But operational issues are behind it.


Management said output should range from 480,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold per quarter in the second half, with total cash costs in the range of $690 to $740 per ounce. By comparison, Q2 gold output was 331,000 ounces at a total cash cost of $825 per ounce.


In an Aug. 10 note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Jackie Przybylowski said that Agnico stock "is well on its way to regaining the historical multiple at which it has historically traded."


She noted that Agnico's assets are in politically safe jurisdictions, including Canada, Finland and Mexico. She also highlighted positive exploration news, highlighting Agnico's "continued opportunities to bring new life to old camps."


Canadian Malartic, a joint venture with **Yamana Gold** ([AUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AUY)), has a project that "has potential to extend the mine life significantly," she wrote. She also noted a zinc discovery at LaRonde and encouraging news out of its Kittila mine in Finland.


In its Q2 earnings call on July 30, CEO Sean Boyd said Agnico would consider raising its 20-cent dividend in Q3.

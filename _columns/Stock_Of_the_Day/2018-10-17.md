Off-price retailer **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) is theÂ [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Ross Stores stock is consolidating and holding up well amid a market sell-off and clinging to a key test of investor support.







Amid last year's retail-pocalypse of store closures and hand-wringing over **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), analysts saw off-price chains as somewhat weatherized against e-commerce. Stores are organized to allow for spontaneous finds for bargain hunters, something online retail has yet to fully replicate.


As investors this month fret over how higher borrowing costs and a long list of geopolitical tensions might affect the economy, Ross Stores' stock has outperformed the broader S&P 500. Its relative strength line, a measure that compares a stock's performance to that benchmark index, touched a record high this week.


But shares of Ross Stores fell 1.4% to 96.96 on the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today).


Still, Ross Stores stock has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Shares are up around 20% so far this year. In a market correction, investors should generally look for companies that have high ratings whose shares are holding steady. Those stocks could be outperformers when the market picks back up.


Ross Stores has also clung to its 50-day moving average, a gauge of investors' confidence in a stock. If a stock hits that line and then moves higher in heavy share volume, that could present an opportunity to buy, according to IBD research. The larger share count could indicate that large institutional investors are coming in to support the stock.

Ross Follows Rival TJX As Stock Of The Day
------------------------------------------


**TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), the parent of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, was [Monday's Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tjx-stock-relative-strength-stock-market-correction/). As with Ross Stores, TJX's Relative Strength line was also at an all-time high.


TJX stock slipped 1.3% Wednesday, holding above its 50-day line.


**Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), yet another off-price apparel retailer, fell 1.7%. Burlington stock hit resistance at its 50-day line.


Ross Stores earnings for the third quarter are due next month. The company this week said it opened 40 stores, a move it said completes its plans this year to add 99 new locations.


The company's [second-quarter results in August](https://www.investors.com/news/ross-stores-earnings-retail-results-strong/) beat expectations, but its outlook underwhelmed Wall Street. RBC analyst Brian Tunick at that time said he believed that increasing freight and labor costs were putting pressure on margins.

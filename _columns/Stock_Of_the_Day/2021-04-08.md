**PTC** ([PTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the enterprise software firm is seeing solid demand for its design and engineering tools. PTC stock flirted with a buy zone on Thursday.




The Boston-based company makes computer-aided design tools as well as software for product life cycle management, industrial Internet of Things and augmented reality.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), PTC stock hit a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 147.77 out of a seven-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. However, it later pulled back. PTC stock ended the regular session at 146.63, up 2.4%. Volume was modestly above average, and too light for a breakout.


In intraday trading Thursday, PTC stock notched a record high of 149.26.

Second-Quarter Earnings Due April 28
------------------------------------


PTC plans to report its fiscal second-quarter results on April 28. Analysts expect the company to earn 70 cents a share on sales of $416.2 million. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 19% in earnings and 16% in sales.


In its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31, PTC earned an adjusted 97 cents a share, up 70%, on sales of $429.1 million, up 20%.


Like other enterprise software firms, PTC has shifted to a software-as-a-service business model. That cloud computing model offers a more stable and predictable revenue stream than licensed software sales.


PTC bolstered its computer-aided design and product life cycle management offerings with the acquisition of Arena Solutions. It bought Arena in January for $715 million in cash.


"We continue to like PTC as a top idea," Baird analyst Joe Vruwink said in a recent note to clients. He rates PTC stock as outperform, or buy.


PTC is benefiting from an improvement in the manufacturing sector, Vruwink said.


Among its businesses, product life cycle management has been "a standout category at PTC for a number of years," he said. "Management cited PLM as 'an anchor tenant' for digital transformation efforts at industrial companies."

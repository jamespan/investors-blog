Keep in mind the sharp reversal in stock markets this week makes buying stocks a risky pursuit at this time. Investor's Business Daily on Monday changed its market direction outlook to "[uptrend under pressure](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx)."


This would be a good time to [review sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), an exit strategy that can help limit your losses. The IBD [CAN SLIM method of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) says limit losses to no more than 7% or 8% from your purchase price.


Pinduoduo Platform A 'Virtual Bazaar'
-------------------------------------


Pinduoduo says it consciously built its e-commerce platform to resemble a "virtual bazaar." Buyers browse and explore a full spectrum of products while interacting with one another. Moreover, it places an emphasis on group purchases.


Using Pinduoduo, buyers can share product information on popular social networks and invite their friends, family and social contacts to purchase together. Through bulk purchasing consumers achieve economies of scale that can lower costs.


Pinduoduo once described its business model as "Costco meets Disneyland."


The company's e-commerce platform offers a wide range of products, including apparel and shoes, products for moms, furniture, household goods and electronics. It also sells food and beverages.


In mid-August, Pinduoduo reported mixed [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinduoduo-earnings-pdd-stock/). Revenue jumped 67% to $1.73 billion, slightly below estimates. It reported an adjusted loss of 1 cent per share. Wall Street expected a loss of 21 cents.


Gross merchandise volume jumped 79% to $179.6 billion. It ended the quarter with 568.8 million monthly active users, up 55%.


Pinduoduo has yet to show a profit. Wall Street analysts currently estimate Pinduoduo won't show a profit until mid-2021.


Pinduoduo Stock IPO A Winner
----------------------------



The company held its [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinduoduo-ipo-initial-public-offering/) in July 2018, pricing shares at 19 and raising $1.6 billion. Pinduoduo stock jumped 41% on its first day of trading.


Backers of Pinduoduo include China-based **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), a leader in messaging, mobile payments and mobile gaming in China. Tencent supports Pinduoduo with services such as payment solutions, cloud services and user engagement via Tencent's WeChat mobile platform.


Tencent was the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tencent-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-court-ruling-wechat-ban/) on Tuesday.

Deckers Outdoor stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares of the footwear maker — known for brands like Ugg boots, Teva sandals and Hoka running shoes — are setting up in a base.




But the setup comes as markets remain rattled by the emergence of the new Covid omicron variant, and as a bruised supply chain complicates upbeat holiday-sales forecasts.


Deckers Stock
-------------


Shares rose 0.2% to 415.20 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today) well off session highs, Deckers stock has a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) buy point of 448.17.



Theoretically, a strong move higher — which would break the downtrend that is forming the handle — could also offer an early entry. But the broader market could still be shaky, as investors process more details about the omicron variant.


Deckers stock has a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 90.


The company in October reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that missed expectations. Deckers held to its full-year sales forecast $3.01 billion to $3.06 billion. It forecast full-year earnings per share of $14.15 to $15.15, compared to a range of $14.45 to $15.10 given in July.


Second-quarter sales across Deckers' Ugg footwear segment, its largest, grew 8% to $448.4 million. Ugg — best known for its sheepskin boots — has been trying to expand beyond women's footwear.


Deckers also noted delays and disruption within its sourcing network related to the pandemic. Still, Deckers stock rose after the report.


Management says that most of its footwear was made in Vietnam. But it says less than 10% of its Vietnam production took place in the nation's southern region, where strict lockdown measures occurred in big production hubs like Ho Chi Minh City. The nation has since begun reopening.


More broadly, a stream of online buying and Covid restrictions in Asia have tangled up the world's supply chain, backing up ports and warehouses and driving shipping costs higher. Thin staffing in warehouses, the trucking industry and some factories have compounded those difficulties.


Along with Deckers stock, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) rose 1.1% to 169.87. Nike is trying to get back above a 174.48 buy point of a cup base. Running-shoe maker **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) fell 2%.

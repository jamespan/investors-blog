Zoetis stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as animal-health products remain "essential" despite the coronavirus pandemic.




The new form of [coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), dubbed Covid-19, has prompted many cities and states to issue shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders. But veterinarian offices have figured out a smart way around social-distancing requirements, Credit Suisse analyst Erin Wright said.


"Many veterinarians are adapting to new social-distancing protocols with allowing curbside drop-off of pets and pickup of medications along with greater utilization of alternative online channels, mitigating some of the disruption," she said in a report to clients.


This inevitably benefits animal-health player **Zoetis** ([ZTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTS)). On a month-to-date basis, Zoetis stock has slipped 11.5% as of Thursday's close. But that compares with a steeper 16.4% dive for the broader industry group of [pharmaceutical companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/best-pharmaceutical-stocks-to-buy/).

Animal Health Sheltered From Covid-19
-------------------------------------


Zoetis makes treatments and vaccines for pets and livestock. In 2019, the company brought in $6.26 billion in sales. [Total revenue](https://news.zoetis.com/press-release/investors/zoetis-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results) grew 7%. Zoetis earnings also grew 16.3% to $3.64 per share, minus certain items.


But while sales to pet owners grew 20% worldwide, revenue from animal-health products for livestock slipped 4%. Still, Credit Suisse's Wright sees even livestock — food animals like cattle, swine and poultry — as being insulated. This segment is a "consumer staple."


CFRA analyst Sel Hardy expects the pet segment to continue its bullish growth streak in animal health.


"We see solid long-term growth potential from emerging markets where pet ownership rates are currently 85% below the U.S., despite a likely slowdown in the first three quarters of 2020 due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 crisis," she said in a note.


Zoetis declined to comment, citing its quiet period ahead of first-quarter earnings.


Zoetis Gains Key Approval
-------------------------


Importantly, Zoetis gained Food and Drug Administration approval last month for a monthly chewable parasiticide. The drug, called Simparica Trio, prevents fleas, ticks and heartworms in dogs. It's the first of its kind on the animal-health market.


Credit Suisse's Wright sees Simparica Trio as taking a major share of a $4 billion market in animal health.


"It will begin taking orders as soon as possible, and Zoetis plans to ship the product in mid-to-late April, largely consistent with the company's most recent disclosure on launch timing," she said in a report last month.



Currently, privately held Boehringer Ingelheim, [**Merck**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/merck-stock-buy-now/) ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Elanco Animal Health** ([ELAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELAN)) and Zoetis have a foothold on the market for flea and tick prevention. The heartworm parasiticide market is dominated by Boehringer Ingelheim, Elanco, Zoetis and Virbac. Virbac doesn't trade in the U.S.


"Overall, we view the market as ripe for disruption with the introduction of combination preventatives (a potential game-changer in companion animal health), merging the two most common maintenance products into one chewable formulation," she said.


Zoetis Stock Has High Ratings
-----------------------------


Wright has an outperform rating and 147 price target on Zoetis stock. CFRA's Hardy lowered her price target on Zoetis shares by 17 to 143 due to the potential for Covid-19 headwinds. But she kept her strong buy rating on the animal-health stock.


Zoetis stock is ranked second in the industry group of pharmaceutical companies. It has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 94 out of a best-possible 99. This puts Zoetis stock in the top 6% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Shares also have a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 87, reflecting the animal-health stock's strong performance over the last 12 months. Leading stocks tend to have RS Ratings of 80 or above.


Zoetis also is on the watchlist for IBD's Long-Term Leaders and should be monitored once the market turns north again.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Zoetis [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) dropped 5.2% to 111.77. Like other stocks, it is trying to rebound from a steep decline.

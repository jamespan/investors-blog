**Capital One Financial** ([COF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COF)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) COF stock is giving investors a second chance to buy the bank stock as it breaks out above another buy point Tuesday.




Financials have been on the rise as the U.S. economic recovery gains strength and Treasury yields turn higher. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) was the [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wfc-stock-breaks-out-jobs-report-lifts-treasury-yields/) on Friday.


The job market is bouncing back and the U.S. has more open jobs than any other time in history. A bullish jobs report sent the 10-year Treasury yield up sharply on Friday. The 10-year yield continued to rise Tuesday, extending its winning streak to six sessions.


Widening Treasury yield spreads are good news for bank profitability.


But the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus is a gathering storm cloud on the horizon as companies rethink return to office plans for the fall. The European Union is also reportedly considering changing its stance on nonessential U.S. travelers visiting as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S.

COF Stock Breaks Out
--------------------


Capital One shares climbed 2.7% to 170.67 on the [stock market toda](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)y, hitting a record high. COF stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) with a 168.10 buy point, according to [MarketSmith analysis.](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)


The consumer bank climbed past an earlier entry of just under 166 on Friday after it finally broke free from the short-term resistance it faced between 165 and 166. But Tuesday's more traditional buy point allows investors that missed the early buy point to jump in on the action.



COF stock has a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of 99 and an EPS Rating of 71. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.


Capital One is ranked ninth in IBD's Finance- Consumer Loans group.


The bank reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations in July. Earnings are roaring back after losses in early 2020 due to the pandemic.


Meanwhile, Wells Fargo stock rose 2% to 49.63, still in range from its 48.23 flat-base buy point.

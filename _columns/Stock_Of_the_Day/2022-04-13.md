Interest Rates Jump
-------------------


Banks and financial companies, including Raymond James, tend to benefit from rising interest rates.


The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield briefly topped 2.82% Tuesday, a three-year high. It has now pulled back to just below 2.68%. Expectations for the combined Fed rate hikes and the unwinding of bond purchases have sent bond prices sharply lower, leading to a jump in Treasury yields.


The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate was near zero throughout 2021. But on March 16, the Fed hiked its key interest rate for the first time since 2018 and signaled six more increases to come this year.


Higher interest rates give a boost to net interest margins. Loans represented about 70% of Raymond James total assets for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2021.

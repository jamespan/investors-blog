Hexcel stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The defense contractor offers a buying opportunity after rebounding from a test of its 50-day line. Hexcel earnings growth has been accelerating as aerospace and defense stocks are strong market performers amid the escalating China trade war.




Hexcel supplies adhesives and composites for over 100 military aircraft programs including the **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) F-35, the **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) F/A-18E/F Hornet and the Eurofighter Typhoon. It also provides supplies for commercial aircraft like the Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner.


Hexcel Earnings Growth Accelerates
----------------------------------


Last month, Hexcel reported quarterly earnings rose 25% to 94 cents per share while revenue grew 11% to $609 million, both beating views. Despite reduced demand for materials related to the Boeing 737 Max, Hexcel said overall commercial aerospace demand remains strong. [Hexcel also raised its dividend](https://www.investors.com/news/f35-supplier-hexcel-earnings-q2-2019-buy-point/) and full-year profit guidance.


Hexcel earnings have risen 11% a year over the last three years while revenue has climbed 6% a year. That's below the 25% gain desired for [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) investing. But Hexcel earnings growth has accelerated for four straight quarters.



Hexcel Stock Technical Analysis
-------------------------------


Hexcel shares edged down 0.1% to 81.32 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Hexcel stock rallied 2.45% on Thursday after it edged back above its 50-day line on Wednesday following Monday's tumble below that key support level. Volume has been below average in recent days, but it's the defense stock's first rebound from the [50-day/10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) since breaking out of a long consolidation in June.


That offers a buying opportunity. But investors should be wary of buying stocks when the [market is in correction](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).


Hexcel stock is moderately extended from that June breakout.


Shares are still off their July 23 record high of 85.63. But the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) for Hexcel stock is already hitting new highs, a bullish sign. The RS line compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500. It's the blue line in the chart below.



Defense Stocks Highly Rated
---------------------------


Hexcel stock has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 92 EPS Rating, according to [IBD's Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-hexcel-corp-hxl.aspx) tool.


Hexcel stock is on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), along with **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and **L3 Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)). Defense giant **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and aerospace supplier **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) are [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stocks.


All are part of IBD's Aerospace/Defense Group, which is rated No. 19 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. Investors should focus on top stocks from leading industries.


Heico stock, L3 Harris stock, Northrop Grumman stock and **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) also have 99 Composite Ratings, with Lockheed stock and many others with scores of 95 or above. (Boeing stock, reeling from the still-grounded 737 Max, has a 45 Composite Rating.)


Best Defense In China Trade War?
--------------------------------


Defense stocks have little direct exposure to the escalating China trade war, though Boeing commercial jet sales are potentially at risk. However, that doesn't mean the group is immune to broader stock market sell-offs related to the China trade war. Hexcel stock came down with the market after President Donald Trump announced plans to impose new China tariffs, then knifed below its 50-day line after the Chinese yuan devaluation Monday.


Despite Monday's elevator-down stock market sell-off, Morgan Stanley on Tuesday upgraded Northrop Grumman stock to an overweight rating from equal weight and started covering L3 Harris stock with an overweight rating.


Northrop stock rose 0.4%, still in buy range after clearing a long consolidation. L3 Harris stock fell 1.3%, slightly extended from a recent breakout. Heico stock edged down 0.3%, trading near all-time highs.


Lockheed stock fell a few cents, trading near record highs after a successful rebound off its 50-day line. Boeing stock advanced 0.4%, but is near 2019 lows.

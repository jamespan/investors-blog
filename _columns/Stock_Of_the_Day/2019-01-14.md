**Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of software for corporate human-resources and accounting departments shows resilience amid worries that a partial government shutdown could slow spending on technology projects. Workday's stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99.




The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. A rising line points to outperformance.


Justin Furby, a William Blair analyst, said in a Jan. 12 report that Workday has zero exposure to federal government agencies. That's unlike **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), for example, which he estimates garners about 10% of annual revenue from the federal government.


The partial federal government shutdown began Dec. 22. The government shutdown affects nine of the 15 federal departments, dozens of agencies, and hundreds of thousands of workers.

Workday is a midsize player in the enterprise software market along with **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and ServiceNow.   From its roots in human capital management (HCM) software, Pleasanton, Calif.-based Workday has expanded into financial management offerings.


Will Corporate IT Spending Slow?
--------------------------------


The partial government shutdown has been one concern. Another worry is that global stock market volatility could spook companies into cutting back on information-technology budgets.


Workday sells HCM software to 35% of the Fortune 500 and half of the Fortune 50.


Furby said that based on his conversations with Workday distribution partners, there's no slowdown yet in technology spending, despite speculation that the U.S. economy could enter a recession by 2020.


"No partners have suggested that the recent market volatility has driven a (technology spending) slowdown," Furby said in the report.


Workday stock slipped 2.5% to close at 163.33 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?) as the Nasdaq composite also fell.


It blasted out of a base on Nov. 30 following strong earnings. But with a short-lived stock market rally rolling over after Dec. 3, its shares fell back, ultimately invalidating a 157.22 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/). The stock has rebounded and has a sound [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) with a new 172.77 buy point.


One question on Workday stock is how much its biggest acquisition to date will help it in financial management offerings.


Workday closed its $1.55 billion purchase of Adaptive Insights on Aug. 1. Adaptive Insights specializes in financial planning software for budgeting and making forecasts.


Could Microsoft Target Workday?
-------------------------------


A second question on Workday is whether it could be acquired by **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Microsoft's Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) software competes with Salesforce.com. Microsoft could extend the Dynamics platform into the human-resources market with a Workday purchase, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said in a report Monday.


He says Microsoft needs to bulk up vs. Salesforce.com and others.


"Microsoft has talked about its large ambitions in business apps, but we note that Dynamics has around $2.5 billion run-rate revenue vs. applications product revenue of $20 billion at **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)), $13 billion at Salesforce, and $11 billion at **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL))," Hedberg said in a report. "Furthermore, by acquiring Workday, Microsoft would add another asset that can heavily leverage the Azure cloud infrastructure."

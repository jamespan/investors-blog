ODFL stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it triggers a strong sell signal after a torrid run to record highs.




**Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), a less-than-truckload fleet operator, has been seeing strong volume and revenue growth. That supports management's stated expectations for "increased market share in 2022 and beyond." It's also investing to expand the capacity of its service center network and fleet, including new technologies.


Peers include **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)), **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)) and **J.B. Hunt Transport** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)). Trucking stocks had held up well in a volatile stock market until just a few days ago, but they are struggling now.


Still, U.S. economic growth generally remains on solid footing. That is good for truck freight volumes, according to trade group American Trucking Associations. The industry's largest problem isn't one of demand, but of securing adequate capacity in the face of constraints, says ATA Chief Economist Bob Costello. Persistent capacity constraints have elevated trucking rates.


ODFL Stock: Technical Analysis
------------------------------


Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line dropped 2% to 333.85 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), breaking decisively below the 50-day/10-week line. The move marks a fairly firm sell signal. Investors with some cushion could hold some or all of their stake until end of week to see if ODFL stock bounces back.


But Monday's move, after Old Dominion seemed to find support at the 50-day line Friday, doesn't look good. ODFL stock broke out past what [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) pegged as a 304.32 buy point.


After a two-week pullback the stock remains up more than 71% for the year. However, investors who bought at the October breakout risk losing the bulk of their gains. ODFL shares initially rallied almost 23% after the breakout, to a peak near 374, a record high, on Dec. 7. By Monday, that advance had dwindled to less than 10%.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) rallied this year through November, but has turned down from an early December high. A rising RS line indicates that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown.


While trucking stocks are broadly starting to struggle, their RS lines suggest the stocks are still worth watching. The pullbacks could be the start of new bases. But in a bad market, even stocks with high RS lines can deteriorate.


Old Dominion bears a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?nav=IBDUKeyTerms) of 99. The rating combines technical and fundamental metrics in one, easy-to-understand score. And ODFL earns a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 95 out of a possible 99. That means it has outperformed 95% of all stocks over the past year.


Old Dominion Earnings and Fundamentals
--------------------------------------


ODFL stock earns a near-perfect EPS Rating of 97 and a top SMR Rating of A, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx) tool.


The North Carolina-based company beat Wall Street's earnings estimates the last six quarters in a row. On a per-share basis, Old Dominion earnings grew between 44% and 85% the last three quarters, well above the 25% or higher CAN SLIM investors want to see. Sales ranged between 14% and 47% over the same period.


In the latest quarter, ended Sept. 30, Old Dominion's operating ratio — a key metric of profitability, comparing operating expenses to revenue — improved to 72.6% from 74.5% a year ago.


Meanwhile, the company has been managing through higher fuel prices and labor costs.


On Dec. 16, ODFL announced a general rate increase of 4.9% to offset rising costs, including real estate, new technology and employee wages.

**Republic Services** ([RSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSG)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the waste collector and recycler has one of the cleanest and flattest stock charts around. RSG stock, which has seen its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) take off amid the S&P 500 pullback. is near a couple of buy points.




Phoenix-based Republic Services is the No. 2 waste hauler in the country behind **Waste Management** ([WM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WM)), but it's the No. 1 stock in the Pollution Control industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Republic Services Growth
------------------------


RSG stock's fundamentals and technical factors match up well with just about anyone â€” not just its own group. Republic Services has a 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), putting it in the top 2% of all stocks.


The company has a lot going for it. Its Sunbelt base offers attractive population and economic growth, relative to the U.S. as a whole. Republic Services made $1.8 billion worth of acquisitions in 2023 and sees no shortage of deal targets going forward.


Productivity initiatives are paying off, raising its adjusted EBITDA margin 60 basis points to 29.7% in 2023. That should rise to 30% this year, the company's outlook indicates.


Revenue grew 10.8% in 2023, including 6% organic growth and 4.8% from acquisitions.


First-quarter earnings are due after the market close on April 30. Waste Management and **Waste Connections** ([WCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCN)) both are set to report late on April 24.


Renewable Natural Gas
---------------------


Republic Services also sees opportunity in "sustainability innovation." According to its latest presentation, the company is has four "polymer centers" to produce recycled plastic packaging that could add $200 million in revenue by 2028.


Further, Republic Services is partnering to convert landfill gas into renewable energy. More than 50 developments are planned, which could add $70 million in incremental revenue by 2028.


In a March 18 note, Jefferies said that the underappreciated renewable natural gas, or RNG, opportunity could lift earnings by 10% to 15% and boost margins by 100 to 200 basis points. At the time, Jefferies hiked his price target for Republic Services to 225 from 213, keeping a buy rating.


RSG
---


RSG dipped 0.1% in Thursday afternoon stock market action, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.2%.


Republic Services has been carving out an eight-week flat base since shares spiked intraday on Feb. 28, following its Q4 report.



Shares of Republic Services have found support lately at its 21-day exponential average.


Republic Services has an official flat-base buy point of 192.57, according to a [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) analysis.


RSG flirted with an early entry point on Thursday, before reversing modestly lower. A move past today's intraday high of 189.83 would be actionable.


However, the current market conditions and upcoming earnings for Republic Services and rivals raise the risk of any buy.


RSG's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) has climbed to a new 52-week high and is right near an all-time high. The advance for the RS line, the blue line in IBD charts that tracks a stock's progress vs. the S&P 500, can be a bullish sign when it happens before a stock breaks out.


However, the pullback in the S&P 500 has lowered the bar.

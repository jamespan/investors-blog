**Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The investment management firm is near an official buy point amid a 10% run since reporting first-quarter earnings as reports swirl it is seriously considering a takeover bid for a major media company.




That comes as several investment management peers also have performed well, including **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)), **Blue Owl Capital** ([OWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWL)) and **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR))


Apollo Global Management invests in private and public markets including credit, equity and real estate. The firm also provides retirement income products to public pension plans, corporate plans, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds and individuals.


On May 2, the company delivered a 21% increase in earnings per share for the first quarter as sales grew 13%. That report came days after [Apollo announced that it would acquire](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/apollo-global-management-investment-companies-asset-management-apo-stock/) **U.S. Silica Holdings** ([SLCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLCA)) in a $1.85 billion deal for the supplier of commercial silica used in the oil and gas industry.


Meanwhile, On April 19 it was reported that Apollo was in talks with **Sony** ([SONY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONY)) for a joint bid on media company **Paramount Global** ([PARA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PARA)). Last week, the New York Times reported that Sony and Apollo Global have signed nondisclosure agreements with Paramount, allowing them to look at Paramount's nonpublic financial information.


Paramount previously shared materials with Hollywood studio Skydance.


Analysts forecast Apollo Management profit will grow 12% in 2024 with a 34% increase in 2025, compared with 2023 levels.

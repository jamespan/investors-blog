WING Stock
----------



Shares edged down 0.5% to 198.36 in Thursday afternoon trade. WING stock is finding support near its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Shares dipped to their [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) earlier this week, close to their prior 193.84 buy point for a [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


Wingstop stock is on track to form a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) after this week with a 223.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


However, a move above Wednesday's high of 202.43 could offer an early entry. That would mean WING stock pushing above its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and breaking a [downtrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/), while still trading close to its 50-day/10-week lines.


Wingstop stock has a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating combines various technical indicators into one easy-to-read score. WING stock has a 98 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) based on its strong earnings growth. Wingstop's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is shy of early-May highs. The stock has a near-perfect 98 [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).

**Ping Identity Holdings** ([PING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PING)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm bullishly rebounds from its 10-week line ahead of earnings on March 4 and the RSA security conference. A "Zero Trust" cybersecurity company, Ping stock has reset its entry point.




Ping launched an initial public offering in September with shares priced at 15. The Ping IPO raised $187.5 million, a sizable sum but not as big as CrowdStrike's $659 million cybersecurity offering in June. CrowdStrike stock has rebounded in early 2020, though the [IBD Computer-Software Security group lags](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/).


Buyout firm Vista Equity Partners acquired Ping in 2016 and backed the offering. Vista Equity remains the largest shareholder, though several highly rated mutual funds hold positions.


Andre Durand founded Ping in 2002. He has been the cybersecurity firm's only chief executive, before and after Vista Equity's arrival.

Ping stock initially fell out of the gate in September, then rebounded and formed a cup chart pattern. After breaking out from that pattern, the cybersecurity stock hit an all-time high of 28.01 in mid-January.


Ping Stock: Forms Flat Base, New Entry Point
--------------------------------------------


The cybersecurity stock has been consolidating for nearly five weeks and seems on the cusp of forming a flat base. As a result, the new proper entry point becomes 28.11 when adding 10 cents to the all-time high. Shares ended Friday trading up 1.3% to 25.83.


In addition, Ping stock has bounced off its 10-week line. The [10-week moving average can also offer new entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), though Ping's conventional buy point is more developed.


Ping stock popped in November on a third-quarter earnings beat. Denver-based Ping reported adjusted profit of 13 cents a share, up 550% from the prior year, while revenue rose 45% to $61.8 million.


The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on March 4. Analysts estimate a 10-cent profit on revenue of 65.74 million.


Zero Trust A Theme At RSA Security Conference
---------------------------------------------


Ping is in the forefront of "Zero Trust" cybersecurity, which is expected to be one theme of the RSA security conference. The RSA security conference starts Feb. 25. Ping rivals include **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)).


[Zero Trust cybersecurity](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/data-breaches-make-zero-trust-buzzword-cybersecurity-stocks/) models focus on internal threats, such as hackers stealing someone's security credentials. Ping's tools verify the identity of network users and check whether their devices are free of malware before granting them access to applications.


Ping customer use its tools to manage the usernames, passwords and access policies of employees, customers, and partners.


With zero trust, users are given access only to select areas, not entire networks.


Ping Stock: IBM, Oracle Customers Targeted
------------------------------------------


"Identity is the new perimeter, resulting from the rise of cloud, mobility and the ability to work anywhere," said RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedbery in a recent report.


Ping aims to displace older CA Technologies, **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) software platforms in corporate information-technology departments. Ping's subscription-based business model provides recurring revenue streams. So annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a key financial metric tracked by Wall Street analysts.


"Ping continues to benefit from modernization efforts as enterprises look to upgrade their legacy IAM (identity access management) solutions," said Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick in a December report. "Ping squarely targets the enterprise market, enabling enterprises to meet [digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/) and security mandates at the same time."

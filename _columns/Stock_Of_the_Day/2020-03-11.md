Subscription video-on-demand leader **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it outperforms the overall market amid coronavirus-fueled turmoil. NFLX stock is looking for support at its 50-day moving average.




On Wednesday, Netflix received [two upbeat reports](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-disney-coronavirus-recession-threats/) from Wall Street firms that had conducted consumer surveys about streaming video services. The results of those surveys provided positive data points for NFLX stock.


The survey data indicated Netflix subscribers in the U.S. largely were staying put despite the launch of new services such as Disney+ from **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and Apple TV+ from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). In fact, many consumers appeared more likely to add new video services than cancel Netflix.


A number of Wall Street analysts say Netflix stock could benefit from the coronavirus scare as people stay home and away from public places. Last week, Imperial Capital analyst David Miller said NFLX stock is "[impervious](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-called-impervious-coronavirus-impact/)" to the negative impact of the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.

However, earlier this week, Needham analyst Laura Martin said [Netflix could be hurt if Covid-19 causes a recession](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-hurt-coronavirus-impact-lingers/). She said a Netflix subscription is a luxury item when people are looking to save on their monthly bills during tough times.


NFLX Stock Returns To Buy Zone Of Earlier Breakout
--------------------------------------------------


In late-afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), NFLX stock fell 4.7%, near 347. It has been trying to find support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) for the last three trading sessions. In recent trades, it was below that mark.


On Jan. 8, Netflix stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 338.10, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It notched a recent high of 393.53 on March 3 before pulling back. On Monday, NFLX stock returned to the [5% chase zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) of the earlier [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

Ranking Netflix, Amazon, YouTube And Hulu
-----------------------------------------


A U.S. consumer survey this month by RBC Capital Markets showed that 65% of respondents watch Netflix. That's unchanged from the December survey and the March survey last year.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was the second-most-popular video service at 60% usage, followed by **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) YouTube with 55% and Disney-controlled Hulu at 48%, RBC said.


"Our survey showed a record high 71% of respondents are willing to pay for more than one streaming service," RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said in a note to clients. "We took these results to indicate the resilience of Netflix's value proposition, despite the two major new OTT (over-the-top TV) launches, as well as the increasing consumer propensity to embrace multiple streaming services."


Mahaney rates NFLX stock as outperform with a price target of 420.


Has Netflix Plateaued In U.S. Market?
-------------------------------------


Netflix likely has plateaued in its most mature market — the U.S., Mahaney said. That is why the company is focusing so many resources on expanding its international business, he noted.


NFLX stock surged after the internet television network reported better-than-expected [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-earnings-q4-2019-netflix-stock/) on Jan. 21. In its first-quarter guidance, Netflix said its expects to add 7 million subscribers worldwide. It ended 2019 with 167.09 million subscribers worldwide, including 67.66 million in the U.S. and Canada.


Netflix stock currently ranks No. 4 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks.

Credit-card-network giant **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Visa stock recently tried to break out of a base, and is one of a [handful of payment stocks setting up](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-mastercard-stock-payment-stocks-to-watch/). Archrival **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) has already cleared an early entry, while **Fiserv** ([FISV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FISV)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) are also in buy range.




Visa Stock
----------


After rising steadily for much of this year, helped by the prevalence of electronic payments, Visa stock hit a record high in September, then consolidated into its current shallow [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). The Dow Jones component's [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 182.50, according to [Marketsmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Visa stock nudged past that entry on Tuesday but has pulled back slightly. Shares dipped 1% to 197.89 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today).


Visa stock is still holding above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), a key test of investors' confidence in a stock. For new investors, the rising 200-day moving average could be a line in the sand. It's now just below the [7% to 8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) area.


The [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has a 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 95 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). Visa's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) has trended lower since September. A stock's relative strength line sinks when it falls behind the S&P 500. But Visa has been a longtime market leader.



Meanwhile, Mastercard stock, which is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), slipped 0.3% to 284.45. That's still above a 282.34 entry for aggressive investors. The conventional [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) buy point for Mastercard stock is 293.79.


Digital, Business To Business
-----------------------------


Visa and Mastercard, which don't issue credit cards themselves but provide the infrastructure to make credit-card payments, have benefited from the rise of electronic, mobile and online payments over cash and checks. Both are trying to expand their business-to-business payment offerings.


Visa's payments volume rose 9% globally in the fiscal fourth quarter, according to data released last month. Payment transactions rose 12.6%. [Visa earnings and sales beat estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-earnings-q4-2019-euronet-earnings-q3/).


Visa closed out the fiscal year with more than 61 million physical merchant locations that use it, up 14% from the prior year. Partnerships with the likes of **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) have also helped.


"The Internet of Things, growth of connected devices, growth of push payments, and payment tokens are expanding the 'ways to pay' and 'ways to be paid,' " William Blair analyst Robert Napoli said of Visa in an October research note. "The company is tapping into these digital payments through tokens, APIs, partnerships with fintechs, and various digital efforts."


Even amid worries about a global economic slowdown, Visa expects financial trends to remain steady.


"We do not view ourselves as economic forecasters," Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu said during the company's earnings call. "As such, our outlook assumes that the trends which have been in place for the past couple of quarters continue through fiscal year 2020."

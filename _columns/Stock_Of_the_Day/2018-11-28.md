The Redmond, Wash.-based software leader has been dueling with Apple this week for bragging rights as the most valuable company. In intraday trading Wednesday, Microsoft overtook Apple for a time as the largest company by market capitalization.


Microsoft ended the regular session with a market cap of about $853 billion. Apple holds a narrow lead with a valuation of nearly $859 billion.


Apple shares have been hammered lately by softening iPhone sales and concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs on its China-made products.


Cloud Computing Focus Boosts Microsoft Stock
--------------------------------------------


In a note to clients, Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, gave several reasons why Microsoft has outperformed Apple lately.


Microsoft is focused on enterprise cloud computing, he said. By contrast, Apple still gets most of its revenue from selling devices to consumers.


"Microsoft has focused on its strengths and taken advantage of corporations' desire to navigate toward the cloud," Morgan said. Apple is tied to the "flatlining" iPhone market, he said.


Microsoft also isn't exposed to the [U.S.-China trade war like Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/09/11/how-a-trade-war-with-china-would-impact-apples-valuation-an-interactive-analysis/#8dac97b65c25) is.


Microsoft has made "huge strides" in cloud computing, he said. It is giving market leader **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) a run for its money in cloud infrastructure and platforms.

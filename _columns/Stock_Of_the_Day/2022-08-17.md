**KLA Corp.** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the semiconductor equipment maker sees its stock nearing a buy point. KLAC stock dipped on Wednesday as the Nasdaq and major exchanges pulled back.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?), KLAC stock dipped 1.5% to 375.09.


KLAC stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 399.06, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/?src=APA1BQ). An alternative analysis of its stock chart shows a 385.99 buy point.


KLA supplies advanced process control and yield management systems for makers of semiconductors, flat panel displays and other electronics.


Electronic chips are made from ultrathin silicon wafers. And the company holds a 60%-plus share of the wafer inspection and defect review market.


KLAC Stock: Market Share Trends
-------------------------------


On July 28, KLA reported better-than-expected quarterly results. In the June quarter, KLA earned an adjusted $5.81 a share on sales of $2.49 billion. On a year-over-year basis, KLA earnings rose 31% while sales climbed 29%. Analysts had estimated earnings of $5.50 a share on sales of $2.43 billion.


The Milpitas, Calif.-based company in June increased its quarterly dividend 24% to $1.30 per share. KLA also said its board authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion in KLAC stock.


Aside from the general outlook for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, analysts focus on KLA's market share trends.


"For the past one to two years, we have been harping on a lack of wafer fab equipment (WFE) share gains during a time where the mix is highly favorable," UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note to clients. "Now we have line of sight to WFE share gain of 100 basis points this year — more than KLAC has gained in any year in its history."


At Susquehanna, analyst Mehdi Hosseini said: "All in all, our thesis remains unchanged that KLAC should continue to increase WFE market share given its already dominant position, especially since a wide adoption of (next-generation) Actinic Inspection has been pushed out."

**Paylocity Holding** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the provider of payroll software cements a cup-with-handle breakout. Paylocity stock got an upgrade Thursday on views that U.S. unemployment will soon stabilize.




Shares in Paylocity stock plunged 48% in March from its all-time high amid the coronavirus lockdown as small businesses closed and bigger firms furloughed workers.


Paylocity stock has climbed as more states and businesses reopen. The stock has forged a new [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) of 140.81. With Thursday's gain, Paylocity stock moved into a buy zone. Shares were jumped 7.1% to close at 143.91.


The Schaumburg, Ill.-based software maker targets businesses with up to 1,000 employees. Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, Paylocity had taken customers away from service bureaus **Automatic Data Processing** ([ADP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADP)) and **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)), analysts say.

Paylocity Stock: Relative Strength Line Hits High
-------------------------------------------------


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx), Paylocity stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87 out of a possible 99. The best stocks own ratings above 80.



In addition, Paylocity's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a new high on Thursday. It's the blue line usually scribed just below the stock's price bars. It compares a stock's price action to that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index.


Further, Paylocity stock holds an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/)of B.


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Paylocity Stock Upgraded To Outperform
--------------------------------------


RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin on Thursday hiked his price target on Paylocity stock to 155 from 120 and upgraded his rating to "outperform."


Paylocity is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in late July.


"We believe F4Q will be the trough," Zukin said in a report to clients. "With the economic situation beginning to stabilize or even improve, we have greater confidence in Paylocity's ability to meet or beat expectations."


In calendar year 2021, Zukin expects Paylocity's revenue growth to return to "the low- to mid-20% range."


Paylocity's distribution partners include more than 30,000 benefits administrators, 401(k) advisors, insurance brokers and human resources consultants. Some analysts see an opportunity focusing on firms with fewer than 50 employees, versus Paychex.


Smaller Rivals May Struggle Amid Covid-19
-----------------------------------------


"We believe that some of the regional providers that the company competes against could become less competitive over time," William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau said in a recent note to clients. "This is due to some not being in a great financial position."


He added that some rivals may not be "positioned well for the new distributed workforce model."


In addition, Paylocity last year rolled out a new interactive training course program, called Learning Management System. In April, Paylocity acquired VidGrid, a video platform that enables peer-to-peer video learning courses.


The IBD Computer-Software Enterprise industry group continues to outperform. It's [ranked No. 2](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-17-2020/) out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), another payroll company, also owns a strong Relative Strength Rating of 87, out of a best-possible 99.

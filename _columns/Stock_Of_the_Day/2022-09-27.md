**Wolfspeed** ([WOLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOLF)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker approaches a buy point after getting another ringing endorsement from a Wall Street firm. Wolfspeed stock advanced on Tuesday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Wolfspeed stock rose 2.6% to 112.63.


Earlier Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar reiterated his overweight, or buy, rating on Wolfspeed stock after he met with the company's management. He has a price target of 130 on Wolfspeed stock.


"We remain impressed by Wolfspeed's positioning in the silicon carbide market, which continues to expand as more use cases come online," Kumar said in a note to clients. "Given their plans to increase capacity, we believe Wolfspeed can capitalize on the tremendous market opportunities in EVs (electric vehicles) and the broader industrial space."


Making Power Chips For EVs
--------------------------


Durham, N.C.-based Wolfspeed makes silicon carbide wafers and chips for power-switching and radio-frequency applications. Its chips are designed for electric vehicles, telecom, aerospace and other markets. Silicon carbide has superior properties vs. traditional silicon in chips for high-voltage applications.



For electric vehicles, silicon carbide chips deliver faster charging and longer driving ranges.


"Demand for the company's silicon carbide products continues to be strong, as design wins are ramping at a rapid pace," Kumar said. The company is severely supply constrained and can't meet current demand, he says.


Wolfspeed stock has formed a short [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 123.35, based on [IBD analysis](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/). IBD profiled Wolfspeed in its [latest New America article](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/wolfspeed-stock-leads-pack-of-power-chip-producers/).


Wolfspeed currently isn't profitable because it's in investment mode. The company is building new factories to support the expected boom in silicon carbide chip demand.


Wolfspeed Stock: Profits Coming Soon
------------------------------------

Freshpet Earnings, Outlook
--------------------------


[Freshpet was IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/freshpet-stock-makes-multiple-bullish-moves-spending-pets-grows/) last month after beating Q3 revenue estimates and matching earnings views on Nov. 2. Sales climbed 29% year over year and EPS rose 13%.


"Despite capacity limitations and the Covid pandemic, Freshpet continued to deliver incredibly strong and consistent growth on the top line and even stronger growth on the bottom line in the third quarter," CEO Billy Cyr said in a news release.


Analysts expect Freshpet to turn profitable on an annual adjusted per-share basis for the first time in 2020. Petfresh also has a weak EPS Rating of 64 out of 99. However, sales growth over the past three quarters as well as past three years has averaged above the 25% or higher that a [CAN SLIM investor would want to see in a top growth stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


When Freshpet next reports, for Q4, Wall Street sees EPS climbing 8% as sales jump 35%. They expect EPS of 13-cents per share in all of 2020 and 59 cents in 2021, according to Zacks Investment Research. In fiscal 2019, Petfresh showed a 4-cent loss.

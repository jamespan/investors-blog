**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the wireless chipmaker forms a bullish chart pattern. Also Monday, investment bank Morgan Stanley identified Qualcomm stock as a top play on the 5G wireless upgrade trend.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Qualcomm stock rose 2.3% to 147.17. It held strong on a down day for many tech stocks.


Qualcomm stock has formed a four-weeks-tight pattern with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 153.43, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. The pattern is an extension of the more common [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) stock chart.


Investors could take a position in Qualcomm stock when it breaks above its short downward-sloping trend line or gets above the bulk of the four-weeks-tight pattern.

Qualcomm Stock Best-Positioned U.S. 5G Chip Stock
-------------------------------------------------


Morgan Stanley named Qualcomm as one of [10 stocks best positioned to benefit from 5G](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-tsm-stock-named-top-5g-wireless-plays/) infrastructure investment and smartphone demand. Others include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). Apple iPhones use Qualcomm chips, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semi.


Morgan Stanley rates Qualcomm stock as overweight with a price target of 159.


Qualcomm is best positioned among U.S. semiconductor stocks to profit from the [5G upgrade cycle](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/), Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report to clients. It is benefiting from higher content in 5G smartphones and overall strong demand for next-generation handsets, analysts said.

Qualcomm stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-qualcomm-inc-qcom.aspx) tool.

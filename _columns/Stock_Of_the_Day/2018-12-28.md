**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The ultra-low-cost carrier has been outperforming most of the market, as other airline stocks tumble on weaker revenue forecasts and a dimmer view globally for next year.







The carrier's relative strength line, which measures whether a stock is doing better than the broader S&P 500, is at highs not seen since the middle of last year. Spirit Airlines stock has also found support at its 50-day line.


Why Spirit Airlines Stock Is Up
-------------------------------


Much of the recent strength in Spirit Airlines stock came on Nov. 27, a day after management [hiked its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/spirit-airlines-stock-soars-bullish-revenue-projection-airline-stocks/) to an 11% gain. Unit revenue measures sales in relation to an airline's flight capacity. Shares surged 15.3%.


The company at that time attributed the brighter unit revenue outlook to its efforts to "dynamically price" non-ticket items like seats and bags. Dynamic pricing for products fluctuates over time in response to demand and consumers' willingness to pay. Spirit Airlines and other ultra-low-cost carriers sell fares for cheap but tack on fees for just about any other amenity.


Spirit also said recent adjustments to its flight network and scheduling led to more seats filled.


"Finally," it added, "the Company believes a stronger industry environment, particularly around peak travel periods, is also contributing some portion of the improved revenue outlook."


Spirit Airlines stock closed up 0.7% at 57.52 n the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). The stock has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating and is up 27% for the year.


**Southwest** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) dipped 0.1%. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) lost 0.6%. **American Airline**s ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) fell 0.7% and **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) rose 0.2%.

New Leadership To Take Over
---------------------------


Spirit's expansion over the years into legacy rivals' turf prompted some carriers to push fares lower to compete. The big three airlines have also launched their own no-frills Basic Economy fares.


But Spirit is weathering that challenge from the legacy carriers and, at the time as it expands into new markets, it's also working on its customer service, a longtime sources of complaints.


Indeed, flying aboard the carrier has often been likened to riding a bus with wings. But the airline has improved its on-time ratings.


"Spirit is clearly maturing (and cleaning up its act for customers) and such improvements should make it a more formidable competitor, in our opinion," Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a research note last week.


Managing this new era for Spirit will fall to a few new key players. President Ted Christie, who has also served as Spirit's CFO, will become the company's new CEO on Jan. 1, taking over from Robert Fornaro.


Another addition will be John Kirby, who will be Spirit's new vice president of network planning. He is coming from **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), where he was vice president of capacity planning and alliances. Before that, he was senior director of domestic and international planning at Southwest.


Clouds Gathering Over Industry, Spirit Airlines Stock?
------------------------------------------------------


Still, Delta this month [cut its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/delta-air-lines-outlook-delta-stock-airline-stocks/). The forecast dragged airline stocks lower.


Later in the month, Delta said it expected a "[slight deceleration in global GDP](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-stock-airline-stocks/)" next year and continued "fuel volatility." Rising fuel prices threatened to squeeze airline profits this year, forcing cuts to flight schedules and other efforts in order to counterbalance the costs.


The swell in prices has since eased, with crude oil collapsing about 40% from an October high. That, too, has raised concerns among some analysts.


Jet fuel is often one of an airline's biggest expenses. When fuel prices fall, profits tend to rise, freeing room for expansion that can result in bruising competition that hurts sales.


"What's worse for airlines: a recession or lower oil?" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note this month downgrading Spirit and other airlines. "Both are toxic, but we trust airlines to react better to a recession than we trust them *not* to behave poorly with lower oil prices."

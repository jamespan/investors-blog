**Equitrans Midstream** ([ETRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETRN)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the gas transmission and storage company brushes off falling U.S. natural gas prices. The stock is setting up just below a buy point amid a run of more than 50% in 2023. ETRN stock gained ground Tuesday.




U.S. natural gas prices dipped less than 2% Tuesday to around $2.47 per British thermal unit, amid a weeklong bounce from six-month lows. Elevated output and an anticipated decrease in demand during the upcoming week has helped keep prices under pressure. Natural gas had traded above $3.80 per Btu in early November.


However, elevated production levels are typically a plus for Equitrans, and Tuesday's slip appeared to have little effect on ETRN stock.


Pennsylvania-based Equitrans Midstream is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., with a significant transmission footprint in the Appalachian Basin. The midstream services company went public on Nov. 12, 2018.


Equitrans Midstream has a natural gas gathering segment and a gas transmission business, which includes interstate pipelines and storage systems. ETRN also has a water network segment — which includes pipelines and water handling facilities. The company's operations are focused primarily in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and southeastern Ohio.


Equitrans Midstream topped third-quarter earnings and revenue expectations on Oct. 31, with EPS ballooning more than 200%. Analysts forecast full-year profit growing 76% to 81 cents per share and revenue increasing around 2% to $1.38 billion, according to FactSet.

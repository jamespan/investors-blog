**Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of measurement and testing systems for the communications and electronics industries continues to shine after a breakout earlier this year. Keysight stock rose on Thursday.




On Jan. 24, Keysight stock broke out of a 21-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 70.50. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Keysight stock rose 1.7% to 89.84. It recently slipped back to the top of the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/), so investors should consider locking in some gains if they haven't already done so.


Keysight stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 96, meaning it has outperformed 96% of stocks over the past 12 months. It is a member of IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group, which ranks No. 20 out of 197 groups.


The Santa Rosa, Calif.-based company spun off from **Agilent Technologies** ([A](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=A)) in November 2014, but its roots trace back to Silicon Valley icon Hewlett-Packard.

Keysight Earnings Rose 82% In First Quarter
-------------------------------------------


In its [fiscal first quarter](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2019-Results/default.aspx) ended Jan. 31, Keysight earned an adjusted 93 cents a share, up 82% year over year. Sales rose 20% and topped $1 billion for the first time in the company's history.


For its fiscal second quarter, Keysight expects to earn 96 cents a share on sales of nearly $1.07 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance. In the year-earlier period, Keysight earned 83 cents a share on sales of $990 million.


"Keysight is at the forefront of several emerging technology trends," Chief Executive Ron Nersesian said on a first-quarter conference call with analysts Feb. 21. "With our broad and differentiated portfolio of solutions, software and services, we are capturing a significant portion of the demand we see in the marketplace."


Benefiting From 5G Network Buildout
-----------------------------------


Keysight is benefiting from the buildout of 5G wireless networks and the development of 5G communications devices, he said.


"Our pace of innovation and engagements has accelerated, and we continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform," Nersesian said. "This quarter we received endorsements from SK Telecom, China Telecom, China Mobile and Softbank."


In addition to 5G business, Keysight is seeing growth in selling test and measurement gear for automotive and energy systems and high-speed networks and data centers.Â The company also sells gear to customers in the semiconductor and aerospace and defense sectors.

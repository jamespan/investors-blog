**Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Tinder dating app operator crafts a shallow cup-with-handle chart pattern after a failed breakout. Match stock has gained 33% from a year ago, thanks to the fast growth of the Tinder mobile app, despite growing competition from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Bumble.




Dallas-based Match operates online dating websites in addition to Tinder. **IAC** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)), controlled by media industry veteran Barry Diller, owns 80% of Match.


Match stock formed an earlier cup pattern from September through February. The base had a depth of 40%.


That's a reason for caution. Bases with depths of more than 40% often are unable to meaningfully advance.


However, Match stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a [technical entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 60.02. The weekly chart shows some accumulation in the new base, a positive sign. Match stock fell 0.6% to close at 54.92 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

Match Stock Reliant On Tinder Growth
------------------------------------


The fast growing Tinder mobile app has boosted Match stock. Match garners nearly half its revenue from the Tinder mobile app, though it's still available as a free app. Match's revenue growth comes from premium versions that provide extra dating features.


The Tinder mobile app added 233,000 paid subscribers in the December quarter, bringing its total to 4.3 million, up 1.2 million from a year earlier. Match has forecast about 1 million Tinder paid subscriber additions in 2019.


Competition, though is heating up. Rival Bumble has followed Tinder into India, a hot market. Bumble is mulling an initial public offering.


Match's negotiations to buy Bumble last year fell through. Bumble differs from Tinder by enabling only women to initiate conversations.


Facebook May Disclose More On Dating Service At F8
--------------------------------------------------


Then, there's Facebook. Facebook has been testing a mobile dating service. Analysts say Facebook could have more to say about its dating app plans at its annual F8 developers conference that starts April 30.


Tinder on April 1 hired Ravi Mehta as its new chief product officer. Mehta had served as Facebook's product director for youth engagement. At Facebook, he helped develop Lasso, a competitor to the popular TikTok short video sharing app.


Match's 2018 profit boomed nearly 52% to $1.47 a share. In 2019, analysts project EPS of $1.66 a share, up 13%.


Revenue growth may also slow, said Brent Thill, analyst at Jefferies, in a report published on April 2.


"While difficult to maintain the 30% growth experienced in 2018, we see sustainable mid- to high-teen revenue growth and high 30% margins," Thill said.


Match Earnings, Revenue Growth Slowing
--------------------------------------


"We expect the stock to grind higher rather than fly higher," he added.


Overseas growth in markets such as India and Japan is key for Tinder, analysts say.


"There is lots of runway (for Match) as cultural taboos crumble. We remain bullish on the international opportunity," said Daniel Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, in a February report.


Match in October announced a special dividend, which boosted the cash position of parent IAC. Analysts say IAC may be planning a major acquisition.


Match is using artificial intelligence to improve its Tinder mobile dating app. It's one [artificial intelligence stock to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).

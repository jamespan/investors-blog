IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) has built a follow-on buy point, thanks to a three-weeks-tight chart pattern. Increased corporate spending on digital transformation projects has boosted Atlassian stock nearly 70% since January 2019.




Many enterprise software stocks are [extended](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/extended--op-in-price-cp-) amid the ongoing bull market. However, Atlassian's new [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) provides an opportunity for a follow-on [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 153.80.


The three-weeks pattern formed after Atlassian stock broke out of consolidation.


A proper three-weeks-tight pattern requires that a stock finishes no more than 1.5% above or below the prior week's close for two consecutive weeks — that is, three weeks of tight closes. Investors can view it on a weekly chart.

Atlassian Stock Forges New Entry Point
--------------------------------------


In addition, the three-weeks-tight formation is normally used to add a small amount of shares to a stock an investor already owns. New investors sometimes can also make an initial purchase with this pattern.


Atlassian stock initially broke out of a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in early 2019. When a stock makes a big move from a [primary buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), it's sometimes a good idea to be cautious on a three-weeks-tight entry point. In Atlassian's case, it appears technically valid.


After hitting an all-time high of 149.80 on July 26, Atlassian stock consolidated for nearly six months. The stock popped on better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings reported on Jan. 23. Then Atlassian formed the three-weeks-tight pattern.


The new 153.80 buy point on Atlassian stock replaces the 140.59 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) formed during the consolidation.


Atlassian's second-quarter revenue and big billings beat came from customers renewing contracts in the December quarter to avoid price hikes. Atlassian's pricing power — its ability to increase fees annually on software developers — has fueled consistent top-line growth.


Software developers at many U.S. companies are under the gun to build and deploy applications faster and more reliably. These apps may be headed to company websites, mobile phones or cloud computing platforms.


Atlassian President Leaving, 'Deep Bench' In Marketing
------------------------------------------------------


The company's project management and bug-tracking tools make it easier for software developers to build, test and release software faster. In addition, such software projects are one type of [digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/).


Atlassian on Jan. 23 announced that President Jay Simons will leave in July. Simons led its distribution and sales strategy.


"While Simons' announcement on the fiscal Q2 call was surprising, Atlassian has a deep bench of talent in the marketing and sales organization," Atlassian stock analyst Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a recent note to clients.


Atlassian did not respond to an IBD inquiry on how soon a new company president will be named.


In July 2018, Atlassian exited the workplace messaging space. **Slack Technologies** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)) acquired intellectual property from Atlassian, which made a small investment in Slack.


Further, Slack stock surged on Monday on word that **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) will become its biggest customer. Atlassian stock rose as much as 2.7% to a session high of 152.38 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Shares ended the session up 2.2% to close at 151.28.

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the consumer electronics giant saw its shares hit a buy point in response to its fall product launch event. Morgan Stanley called Apple stock "a top pick heading into 2020."




Apple stock surged past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 221.47 out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) in afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It ended the session up 3.2% at 223.59.


Apple also returned to its milestone $1 trillion valuation. It is the second-most-valuable company, behind **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which has a market capitalization of $1.03 trillion.


On Tuesday at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Apple unveiled its [iPhone 11](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphone-11-launch-event/)-series smartphones, along with a new iPad tablet and Apple Watch smartwatches. It also detailed its upcoming Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade subscription services.

Analysts praised the iPhone 11 handsets for their [advanced cameras](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphone-11-tempts-consumers-with-major-camera-upgrades/) and improved battery life. Apple also surprised observers with a much lower-than-expected price for its Apple TV+ streaming video service. It priced the service at $4.99 a month, vs. expectations for $9.99.


Apple stock was added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) on Tuesday morning.


Apple Stock Called 'Top Pick Heading Into 2020'
-----------------------------------------------


In a report Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her overweight rating on Apple stock. She said the stock is a "top pick heading into 2020" thanks to a forecast return to growth.


"We see a combination of revenue growth re-acceleration and multiple expansion driving shares to our $247 price target," she said. Growth drivers include the iPhone 11 series, new services and next year's 5G iPhones, Huberty said.


Apple has posted three straight lackluster quarters. In the [June quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q3-2019-apple-stock/), Apple earnings fell 7% year over year to $2.18 a share, while sales crept up 1% to $53.8 billion.


For the September quarter, analysts expect Apple earnings of $2.83 a share, down 3%, on sales of $62.2 billion, down 1%, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Analysts see Apple returning to growth in the December quarter. Wall Street is modeling Apple earnings of $4.44 a share, up 6%, on sales of $85.5 billion, up 2%, Zacks said.


Apple Gets Price-Target Hike On Ecosystem Move
----------------------------------------------


Also Wednesday, Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her strong buy rating on Apple stock and raised her price target to 250 from 225.


Apple's transition from a hardware company to a provider of both hardware and services "increases ecosystem lock-in, which drives upside to AAPL's valuation."


Apple stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products industry group, according toÂ [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-inc-aapl.aspx). It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 81, meaning it has outperformed 81% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

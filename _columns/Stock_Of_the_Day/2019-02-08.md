**Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after charging past a buy point on strong earnings and sunny guidance.




The firm operates a network of ATMs overseas and has a booming money transfer business, which provides global consumer-to-consumer and account-to-account services.


The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) reported Q4 results late Thursday, and Euronet earnings per share climbed 21% to $1.37, better than views for $1.27, as revenue grew 7% to $649.4 million, the smallest gain in three years but below consensus for $664 million.


But DA Davidson analysts noted that revenue is actually above consensus when accounting changes are taken into account. Euronet said revenue was reduced by $35 million due to an accounting change in the Prepaid segment.


Transactions increased 15% to 1.08 billion. EFT processing revenue climbed 10% to $161.3 million due primarily to a 9% year-over-year increase in active ATMs and a 13% increase in transactions, which were led by Europe and India. Epay revenue grew 3% to $215 million, and Money transfer revenue rose 15% to $274.1 million.


Piper Jaffray said the epay segment was stronger than expected, while money transfer business was in-line and EFT was a little softer vs. consensus, ATM winter seasonality may have been a factor.


Euronet sees Q1 EPS at 83 cents, above consensus views for 79 cents.

Euronet Stock Charges Into Buy Zone
-----------------------------------


Euronet stock surged 9.75% to 126.57 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), vaulting above a 116.48 buy point from a 9-week [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) base. Euronet stock has been on a solid upward trend since April 2017, which is reflected in its muscular [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/).


The stock has strong fundamentals, which are reflected in its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 95. The Stock Checkup Tool shows it has strong earnings growth, which is why it has an EPS Rating of 93. In the previous quarter, earnings shot up by 34%.


Among other payment stocks, **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) rose 0.15%, **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) climbed 1.2%, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) added 1.1% and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) gained 2.1%.


Key Visa Cardholder Catalyst
----------------------------


Even as the rise of digital payments has led to "Venmo" becoming a verb, cash has not gone out of style, and this is especially the case in the key overseas markets where Euronet operates its ATMs.


The IBD 50 member also looks to be one of the hot stocks of 2019, as it collects lucrative currency fees when Visa cardholders use Euronet ATMs.


While the use of ATMs may fall due to the rise of digital payments, there is a need for more machines, Piper Jaffray analyst Jason Deleeuw, who rates Euronet as overweight with a 145 price target, has said.


"Cash usage in Europe is much higher than in the U.S., especially in Central and Eastern Europe," he told IBD in November. "Also, ATM per capita in Europe is significantly below that in the U.S. … so EEFT is serving an underserved ATM market."


India is also growth market that offers a significant opportunity for the hot stock, with more Indians are getting bank accounts as the country's financial services industry modernizes.

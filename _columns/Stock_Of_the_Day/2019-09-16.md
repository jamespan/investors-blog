**Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the defense giant chasing a buy point amid rising global tensions.




Northrop is a major subcontractor on **Lockheed Martin**'s ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) F-35 stealth fighter jet and produces drones such as the Global Hawk, while its purchase of Orbital ATK boosted its space offerings. Arguably its most famous product is the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.


Another big moneymaker will be the B-21 next-generation stealth bomber. The Air Force plans to buy 80 to 100 planes to replace Cold War-era **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) B-52s. Analysts estimate the total acquisition price tag could hit $80 billion.


In recent weeks, Northrop has closed in on a lucrative Pentagon deal to replace aging land-based Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, which were manufactured by Boeing. It is the last contractor standing in the race for the initial contract, which is valued at $11 billion. The total program is valued at $85 billion-$100 billion.


Meanwhile, with global tensions rising amid alleged Iranian provocations in Saudi Arabia, continued difficulties with North Korea, and expanding territorial disputes involving China, the defense sector looks like it could perform well in the coming months.

Stock Of The Day Leads Big Project
----------------------------------


Northrop Grumman is now poised to clinch the Pentagon's ballistic missile deal, and last week rebuffed Boeing's offer to team up on the project. The Dow Jones giant had [previously dropped out of the running to compete with Northrop](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-gbsd-icbm-nuclear-missile-pentagon-contract/) for the GBSD contract.


[Boeing had previously complained in two letters to the Air Force](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-gbsd-icbm-nuclear-missile-pentagon-contract/) that Northrop has "an unfair advantage" because of "its control of solid-rocket motors" and that the Air Force didn't do enough to mitigate the issue.


Meanwhile, Northrop is moving ahead and picked **Aerojet Rocketdyne** ([AJRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AJRD)) to provide both a large solid rocket motor system and a post-boost propulsion system.


Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion has powered every U.S. ICBM ever flown or fielded. The firm has invested to provide advanced and affordable propulsion systems for GBSD and other future national security requirements.


"Over the past three years Aerojet Rocketdyne has refined processes and built state-of-the-art facilities to mature our technology and increase affordability for the propulsion systems we will provide for the GBSD program," CEO Eileen Drake said in a news release.

**Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after bullishly bouncing from the 50-day line to pass two buy points. Tempur Sealy stock, an [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) member has advanced more than 120% over the past 13 months. Sales growth has been accelerating and analysts expect stronger Tempur Sealy earnings gains in 2020.




A number of other stocks are benefiting from the current bedding boom, with rival mattress makers **Sleep Number** ([SNBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNBR)) reclaiming a buy zone and **Purple Innovation** ([PRPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRPL)) exiting the 5% chase zone.


Upscale furniture retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is also working on a base, staging a bullish rebound from key support Tuesday. In November RH stock jump on the news legendary investor Warren Buffett is backing the stock, with **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) snapping up 1.2 million shares.


Lexington, Kentucky-based Tempur Sealy was formed in 2012 when memory foam mattress manufacturer Tempur-Pedic International acquired Sealy, which was its biggest competitor. It produces a range of mattresses and bedding products.


It continues to grow, and last week announced it taking a majority stake in private-label name Sherwood Bedding, its first move into the private-label category. It is taking an 80% stake for about $40 million.

---------------------------


Shares jumped 4.4% to 92.37 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) in heavy volume. Tempur Sealy stock blasted past an aggressive buy point of 89.86. It then kept running to a new high of 93.17, clearing a conventional [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) intraday from a [13-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). TPX stock closed just below the ideal entry point of 92.43, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Amid Monday's market sell-off, Tempur stock rebounded bullishly after undercutting its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) intraday. In addition the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been making progress, and is closing in on recent highs.


After a long period of slumber, Tempur Sealy stock woke to advance with refreshed vigor from the start of 2019. Since the start of that year the stock has more than doubled.



Tempur Sealy Earnings
---------------------


Tempur Sealy stock has a strong, but not quite ideal, [IBD Composite Rating of 92](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-tempur-sealy-intl-inc-tpx.aspx) shows earnings have been lagging market performance, but it has been improving.


Over the past three quarters Temper Sealy earnings per share has grown by an average of 27%, though it slowed from 39% to 27% in the most recent quarter. Revenue gains have gradually accelerated for six straight quarters.


Analysts expect Tempur Sealy earnings to rise 28% for all of 2019, after declining in the prior two years. In 2020, the consensus is for Tempur Sealy earnings to jump 45%.


Rival Mattress Stocks
---------------------


Among rivals, Sleep Number stock rallied 4.3% to 52.67, back above a 52.25 buy point. It broke out from a flat base on Jan. 23, but then sold off in the next two sessions. Sleep Number stock hasn't fared as well as Tempur Sealy over the past year, while earnings growth is expected to slow in 2020.


Purple Innovation stock popped 7.1% to 11.98, hitting a 22-month high. The thinly traded PRPL stock is just out of buy zone after breaking out from a consolidation with an 11.14 buy point.


RH Stock
--------


Moving from mattresses to upscale furniture is RH. RH stock, which is also on [the IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), rose 3.2% to 220.74, rebounding from its 50-day moving average. That could offer an aggressive entry, though RH stock has tested its 50-day/10-week line a few times since a September breakout. RH stock is in a consolidation with a 243.77 entry. Investors could treat the area just below 230 as a resistance are to enter as well.


RH stock has a best possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.


Analyst Sees Sales Bounce For Tempur Sealy Stock
------------------------------------------------


Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham is rating Tempur Sealy stock as outperform with a 100 target. He recently raised estimates for Q4 based on new analysis of sales. He said sales of Tempur-Pedic and Stearns & Foster products are "more material than previously estimated."


"With transitory headwinds fading, the outlook for TPX in 2020 is brightening. Tempur-Pedic's new products are resonating, with more momentum to come from the high-end Breeze product currently being rolled out," he said in a Dec. 3 research note. "We believe Breeze alone could drive 5% revenue growth even assuming no incremental unit sales, and even faster profit growth."


He also said new premium products from the Stearns & Foster brand are being well received, which is helping grow Sealy segment bedding sales.

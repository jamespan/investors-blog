**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it flirts with a breakout following a massive third-quarter beat and looks to turn profitable.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Dexcom [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) lifted 2.6%, to 148.41, in [higher-than-average volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/). Dexcom stock briefly edged above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 148.66 out of an early-stage base at one point on Thursday.


Dexcom is operating in a profitable area of medical equipment. The company makes [continuous glucose monitoring systems](https://www.dexcom.com/cgm-vs-bgm) for diabetic patients. Earlier this year, Allied Market Research projected the market will grow at 22% compound annual growth rate, going from $894 million in 2016 to $4.92 billion in 2024.


"According to the International Diabetes Federation, [the number of (the) diabetic population](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/global-continuous-glucose-monitoring-systems-market) is expected to reach 642 million by the year 2040 as compared to 415 million patients in 2015, worldwide," Allied said in its May report. "Thus, one out of every ten adults is expected to have diabetes by 2040, which reveals the graveness of this pandemic."

From Loss To Gain
-----------------


Top-rated Dexcom is already tapping into that market. Dexcom turned around a two-quarter streak of per-share losses earlier this week. On Tuesday, the diabetes systems maker [reported adjusted earnings](https://dexcom.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dexcom-reports-third-quarter-2018-financial-results) of 17 cents per share for the third quarter.


That easily beat estimates from analysts polled by FactSet for a 9-cent loss. Adjusted income spiked from a 1-cent gain in the year-ago period. Sales grew 44% to $266.7 million, handily beating forecasts for $242.7 million.


Chief Executive Kevin Sayer credited Dexcom's newest product, the [Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system](https://www.dexcom.com/news/fda-authorizes-dexcom-g6), for some of its success in the quarter. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the new diabetes system in March.


"Dexcom has maintained the strong momentum we have seen all year, with sales up 45% on a constant-currency basis," he said in a written statement. "Clearly our G6 launch has been very well received and leaves us in a strong position for continued growth."


Dexcom Nears Annual Profitability
---------------------------------


Dexcom's quarterly sales have grown by double-digit percentages since at least June 2014. The road to profitability, though, has been rockier for the diabetes systems company. In 2019, some expect Dexcom to reach annual profitability.


First Call, which polled 16 analysts, expects Dexcom to report an adjusted 2-cent annual gain in 2019. For 2020, 12 analysts polled by First Call model adjusted earnings of 48 cents.


Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research don't expect Dexcom to make a profit in 2019. The average of 11 analysts is for an 11-cent loss. But their 2020 views are more in line with First Call's. Then, five analysts see Dexcom earning 45 cents a share, excluding items.


Analysts polled by Zacks also call for Dexcom to surpass $1 billion in annual sales in 2019, with $1.13 billion. The diabetes systems-maker could come near that mark this year with an estimated $959 million in sales.


Dexcom Stock Outperforms Medical Systems Stocks
-----------------------------------------------


Dexcom is highly rated by Investor's Business Daily standards. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 95 out of a best-possible 99, and a top [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 99. Dexcom stock ranks seventh out of 55 medical systems stocks.


The group itself is ranked a strong No. 21 out of 197 groups IBD tracks. That's up from No. 47 just last week. Year to date, the medical systems stocks have risen nearly 26%. Dexcom stock is massively outperforming that. Dexcom stock has rocketed 152% since the beginning of 2018.

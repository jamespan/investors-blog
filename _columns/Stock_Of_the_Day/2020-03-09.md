**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after hitting a multiyear high in a key gauge as the coronavirus stock market correction hits new lows. Walmart stock held its ground Monday, while **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) outperformed the market.




With the coronavirus-related sell-off hitting growth stocks and consumers rushing to stores to stock up on essentials like water, canned goods and toilet paper, the Dow Jones stock is bucking the trend by actually rising toward a buy point.


And with the overall market plunging, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) of Walmart stock has hit a five-year high. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500. When the line is sloping higher, it means the stock is outperforming the broader index.

Walmart Stock Analysis
----------------------


Walmart shares dipped seven cents to 117.16 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), off intraday highs of 120.63. Walmart stock is working toward a 125.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a 17-week consolidation, [MarketSmith analysis shows.](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) But with the coronavirus stock market correction intensifying, it's not a good time to be thinking of buying.


Since hitting a recent low on Feb. 28, Walmart stock has rebounded, reclaiming its 50-day and [200-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/).


The Dow Jones stock had been falling since the retail giant reported weaker-than-expected holiday-quarter earnings last month. Same-store sales also missed. But the company's consistent results make Walmart stock a safer bet during the current market turmoil.



During a market correction, investors should focus on building watchlists of stocks with high relative strength lines. Such stocks are often big winners in the next stock market rally. However, WMT stock may be acting as a defensive play. So it's unclear if Walmart stock will continue to outperform when the stock market starts to rally once more.


Walmart stock has a mediocre [IBD Composite Rating of 65](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). The [IBD Stock Checkup tool is flashing mixed signals.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-walmart-inc-wmt.aspx) While Walmart stock has a strong, but not ideal, Relative Strength Rating of 82, its [EPS Rating of 52](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is poor.


Over the past three quarters, EPS growth has averaged just 1%, with a 2% decline in the latest quarter. Long-term Walmart earnings growth also is poor, averaging out at 6% over the past three years. This is below the 25% growth sought by the [CAN SLIM cognoscenti](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) in both these metrics.


Amid related stocks, Costco stock fell 3.3%, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) dipped 1.8%, and **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) dropped 2.5%, all outperforming the broader market. Costco stock and Kroger stock are near recent 52-week highs, with RS lines at highs. Target stock is trying to hold its 200-day line.

Stock Market To 'Remain Ugly,' Says Analyst
-------------------------------------------


OANDA market analyst Edward Moya thinks investors will "eventually" get back into stocks, but believes selling could "remain ugly" for a couple more days.


"Technical selling is getting ugly and even though expectations are high the Fed will take rates to the zero bound, the retail investor will likely want to wait this one out," Moya said in a research note. "It seems the collapse, with oil prices, have added a log to the deflationary fire the Fed will try to extinguish. Virus fears, deflationary risks, and growing stress in the credit markets, means markets will see the Fed launch a new QE program very soon."


Moya believes the "longer-term playbook" will be to buy stocks again as markets move beyond the virus and adjust to lower oil prices.

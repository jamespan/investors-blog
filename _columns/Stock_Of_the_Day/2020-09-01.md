**Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the enterprise software maker breaks out ahead of its virtual investor day on Sept. 16. Dynatrace stock has gained 86% in 2020, including Tuesday's action. Meanwhile, shares in rival **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) have retreated recently.




With Tuesday's gain, Dynatrace stock climbed above a 44.75 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) into a 5% buy zone. It had been consolidating for the past eight weeks. It ended the regular session Tuesday up 6.5% to 47.09.


Dynatrace stock has bullishly bounced back from a secondary offering that pressured the stock in early August. It's not unusual for secondary offerings to pressure new initial public offerings because of equity dilution.


The software stock has been on IBD's [IPO Leaders list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).

Dynatrace Stock: High-End Cloud Platform
----------------------------------------


The software maker's computer network monitoring tools measure and analyze the performance of business-critical applications. Amid the coronavirus emergencies, many companies have shifted to remote work and cloud computing services.


Dynatrace competes in the application performance monitoring market vs. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), Datadog, **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) and others. Further, Datadog stock fell after it [reported June-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/datadog-earnings-datadog-stock-ddog-q22020/).


Dynatrace targets the high end of the corporate market. In a recent note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said the company has avoided intensified price competition. Dynatrace "offers a premium product where value matches pricing," Hedberg said.


He added: "We believe growth and profitability can remain elevated for several years as the company separates from the monitoring pack" with a "high-end cloud monitoring software intelligence platform."


Dynatrace IPO Raised $570 Million
---------------------------------


Waltham-Mass.-based Dynatrace went public in August 2019, backed by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Its initial public offering raised $570 million, with shares priced at 16.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx), Dynatrace stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of a best-possible 99. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. An upward-trending RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


Dynatrace sports an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Meanwhile, Dynatrace stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C-plus. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Thoma Bravo Acquired Compuware, Dynatrace
-----------------------------------------


In its fiscal first quarter that ended June 30, Dynatrace earned 13 cents a share on an adjusted basis, up 225% from a year earlier. The enterprise software maker's revenue climbed 27% to $155.5 million.


That topped consensus estimates for earnings of 10 cents a share on revenue of $149.6 million.


In addition, analysts say one key financial metric for Dynatrace stock is annual recurring revenue, or ARR. In the June quarter, Dynatrace said ARR rose 37% to $601.4 million vs. estimates of $580 million.


Dynatrace has steadily converted on-premise customers to subscription-based cloud products. Customers include **Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), Experian, Air Canada and **Daimler** ([DDAIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDAIF)).


Compuware acquired Dynatrace in 2011 for around $250 million from a group of venture capital backers. Thoma Bravo then bought Compuware for $2.4 billion in 2014 and carved out Dynatrace.


Dynatrace stock ranks No. 10 out of 77 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group. That group ranks ninth out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

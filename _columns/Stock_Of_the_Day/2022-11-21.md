**Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). After the biotech company reported its fourth quarter of accelerating growth, CPRX stock is approaching a breakout.




The company sells a treatment for a rare autoimmune condition called Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or LEMS. The disease affects communication between the nerves and muscles, and saps away at muscle strength. It's closely tied to cancer. In the third quarter, Catalyst's drug, Firdapse, brought in $57.2 million in sales, rocketing more than 59%.


Catalyst also is looking to expand its pipeline through an acquisition or partnership. A deal could be close, Chief Executive Patrick McEnany said on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 10.


"Currently, we are in advanced stages of due diligence to acquire commercial-stage products and/or companies," he said. "And while no agreements have been reached to date, we are hopeful that we will be in a position to announce a transaction later this year."


CPRX Stock: Sales Growth Expected To Slow
-----------------------------------------


An acquisition would be a boon for CPRX stock investors.


On a year-over-year basis, revenue growth has accelerated for eight straight quarters, including five periods in which growth was better than 20%. Also, adjusted earnings growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. In three of those quarters, growth was stronger than 50%.


But sales growth is expected to moderate. CPRX stock analysts call for 48%, 39% and 15% growth in the upcoming three quarters. Another product — or more — could certainly help Catalyst's top line.


"Our key priority on the strategy and business development front continues to remain our intention to broaden and diversify our product portfolio through collaborative partnerships (or) acquisition of commercial-stage assets or companies," McEnery said.


Highly Rated Stock On IBD 50

Shares are now finding support at their [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), though they're a bit extended from the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) shows.

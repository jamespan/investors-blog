**Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it outperforms in the coronavirus bear market. Axon stock is making a bullish move Thursday as the company offers its digital evidence platform to law enforcement during the coronavirus crisis.




The company supplies body cameras, Tasers and cloud-based digital evidence systems to law enforcement. On Thursday, Axon Enterprise said it's providing free global access to the digital evidence platform, Axon Citizen, to public safety agencies.


"With this tool, officers can gather digital evidence from the community by sending a personalized link via text message or email from Axon's digital evidence management platform, Axon Evidence, or the Axon Capture mobile app," [Axon Enterprise said](https://investor.axon.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Axon-Responds-to-COVID-19-Emergency-By-Offering-Up-Digital-Evidence-Gathering-Platform-to-Public-Safety-Agencies-Worldwide/default.aspx) in a statement. "This eliminates the need for in-person interaction and helps to minimize officer exposure to COVID-19."


For the company, the free access is an opportunity for law enforcement around the world to get exposure to its evidence platform, with an eye toward becoming paying clients when the coronavirus crisis recedes.

Wall Street expects Axon earnings to decline 19% in Q1 but to increase 12.5% to $1.17 in all of 2020 and rise a further 24% in 2021, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would be below the three-year EPS growth rate of 38%.


Analysts see revenue rising 16% in 2020 and 17% in 2021. That would be below the three-year sales growth rate of 23%.


A major regulatory risk also looms. The company is battling the Federal Trade Commission, which argues its 2018 Vievu purchase was anti-competitive.


The FTC wants Axon to license out its technology to a brand-new competitor. Axon argues the FTC enforcement process is unconstitutional.

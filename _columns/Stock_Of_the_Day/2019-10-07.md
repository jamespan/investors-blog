**Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier revs up on improving price trends. Saia stock is consolidating bullishly just above a buy zone.




The Georgia-based carrier is on an expansion streak, adding several terminals and unveiling new pricing initiatives. Saia's trucking network covers 42 states in the U.S. and Canada. Saia earnings growth, though cooling somewhat, is stronger than that of many peers such as **JB Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) and **Old Dominion** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)).


Less-than-truckload shipping is typically used when shipments are too heavy for a parcel carrier and too small for a full truckload. It combines shipments from multiple customers, making it a budget-friendly option


Saia Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares of Saia closed up 0.7% at 91.85 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/).


Saia stock is slightly extended from an 87.15 alternate [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as well as an earlier 84.53 cup-with-handle entry. Shares showed much stronger volume when clearing the 87.15 entry to a new high from a consolidation going back to 2018. The 5% chase zone from that buy point runs up to 91.51.


The transportation stock hit a record 97.59 on Sept. 25, and has pulled back slightly since then. For now, there's no entry for Saia stock. But that could quickly change.


Saia stock could dip back into a buy zone. A drop to the 50-day/10-week line could offer a follow-on buy opportunity. Alternatively, Saia stock could consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new, short base.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has bolted higher since July. The RS line is at record highs after trending higher even as the stock market pulled back in August. The RS line, tracking Saia stock's performance against the S&P 500, is shown in blue in the chart below.



Both the 10-week line and 40-week line are trending up, another bullish sign.


Saia stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94 out of a best-possible 99. That means it is in the top 6% of all stocks, with an attractive mixture of fundamental and technical characteristics.


It's the No. 2 stock in the trucking-transportation group, behind **PAM Transportation** ([PTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTSI)), the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-saia-inc-saia.aspx) shows.


However, Saia's RS Rating of 97 is the best in its industry group. That means Saia stock is in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of share price performance over the past 12 months.


Saia Earnings Growth
--------------------


An EPS Rating of 89 is solid enough. Saia earnings growth averaged 38% in the past three quarters, which is exactly in line with the three-year annual EPS growth rate.


That's above [CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) that recommend investing in stocks with current quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%.


But recent growth has been choppy.


Earnings growth went from 83% to 10% to 22% in the last three quarters. Looking ahead, analysts foresee annual EPS growth slowing to 17% in 2019 and to 13% in 2020. Sales growth has slowed to the single digits.


An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C suggests buying and selling have been roughly equal in recent weeks.


Saia stock has gained 36% in the past year, vs. declines for PTSI stock, JB Hunt stock and **XPO Logistics** ([XPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPO)) in the same period. Meanwhile, Old Dominion Stock rose in the single digits over the last year.


Why is Saia stock outperforming its peers? It comes down to earnings growth. Saia earnings growth has cooled somewhat, but it's still solid, especially as the U.S. goods economy sputters.


Meanwhile, JB Hunt earnings growth slowed to 0% in the latest quarter, with analysts expecting EPS declines in the current quarter. Old Dominion's earnings are expected to be flat in the next quarter after slowing to 9%. Pam Transportation earnings had been booming, but are expected to fall in the current quarter and in 2020.

Northeast Expansion Turns Profitable
------------------------------------


Saia has benefited from a Northeast expansion. Since the expansion began in May 2017, Saia has now opened 13 new terminals there. The region turned profitable for Saia in Q2.


"We continue to see growth with existing customers as we extend our reach and offer direct service to more locations," CEO Rick O'Dell said in the July earnings statement.


Pricing Higher For Residential Deliveries
-----------------------------------------


O'Dell also sees a "constructive" pricing backdrop for the transportation industry.


Saia's own new pricing initiatives include contracting with an outsourced mapping/business intelligence vendor to grow the residential market.


"Saia is now able to know which deliveries are in fact residential, and can then price higher," Cowen analyst Jason Seidl wrote Aug. 15. Residential deliveries are now 7% of Saia's total deliveries, up from 5% earlier.


The Cowen analyst believes the company's improved pricing strategy will aid margins.


The trucking-transportation group to which Saia belongs now ranks No. 46 out of 197 industry groups. That's down from No. 27 last week but up from No. 134 three months ago.

Earnings And Fundamentals
-------------------------


The hotel stock sports a solid [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 80 out of 99. Wyndham Hotels began its earnings rebound in Q2 2021 and built on the recovery in Q3.


On a per-share basis, Wyndham earnings vaulted 222% year over year in Q3, though slowing from an 850% gain the prior quarter. The company raised its full-year 2021 outlook after smashing Q3 earnings views.


"These results have been fueled by the many investments we made over the last two years to capture an increasing share of both leisure and everyday business travel," said Wyndham CEO Geoffrey Ballotti.


For the full year, Wall Street expects Wyndham earnings per share to almost triple as sales increase 20%, according to FactSet.


Both earnings and sales are expected to grow further in 2022, though slowing from 2021's pace. They fell sharply in 2020 due to pandemic lockdowns and travel curbs.


The company has been on a room-opening spree. It also launched an upper-midscale brand, called Alltra, targeting vacation travelers.

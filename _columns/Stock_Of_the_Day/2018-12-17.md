**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), a diversified supplier of semiconductors for wireless communications and enterprise infrastructure that is showing strength in a weak market.







Broadcom stock has made quite an impression on Wall Street. The stock went on a big run from an early stage [breakout](https://www.investors.com/ibd-indexes/ibd-breakout-stocks-index/) that began in September 2013 to its peak in November 2017. It has been consolidating since November 2017, with a current buy point of 285.78.


Among the positive characteristics of Broadcom stock is a fast-rising [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/leader-laggard/)Â now stands at 84 out of a possible 99. When looking for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), one factor to watch closely is the relative strength line, especially during market corrections. Lines that are trending higher are outperforming the broad market as measured by the S&P 500. Such stocks will often lead the market once the correction runs its course.


The RS Rating shows how a stock's price behavior over the trailing 52 weeks compares with all the other stocks.


Another positive indicator is Broadcom stock recently shot above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and 200-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq is trading below those averages.

In May 2015, in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, Avago Technologies announced the acquisition of Broadcom for $37 billion. The combined company kept the Broadcom name but used the Avago ticker of AVGO. Its chip solutions are used in a wide range of smartphones, including the **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone. The company also provides infrastructure software, data center networking and storage.


Broadcom Earnings
-----------------


Broadcom stock jumped on Dec. 7 after reporting [quarterly earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-stock-q4-2018-broadcom-earnings/) that beat Wall Street's targets. It also raised its sales guidance for fiscal 2019 and hiked its dividend.


Adjusted earnings rose 27% to $5.85 per share from the year-ago period. Revenue rose 12% to $5.44 billion. Both revenue and earnings have grown at double- or triple-digit rates going back more than four years, from the year-ago period.



Following the earnings report, Nomura analyst Romit Shah maintained a buy rating on Broadcom stock, with a price target of 300. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley also maintained a buy rating and price target of 300, about 16% up from where the stock currently trades.


"We believe Broadcom is a leading global diversified semiconductor company with a broad portfolio of category-leading products," Walkley wrote in a note to clients.


Where Broadcom Stock Is Going
-----------------------------


Broadcom stock slipped 0.3% to close at 254.13 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


For fiscal 2019, Broadcom guided to sales of $24.5 billion. That would be a year-over-year increase of 17.5%. That's above Wall Street estimates of $22.4 billion. For the current quarter, analysts expect revenue of $5.86 billion, up 10%, with adjusted earnings of $5.28 a share, up 3%.


Broadcom stock has been on a choppy ride this year due in part to its failed acquisition of **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and weak Apple iPhone sales. In November, Broadcom complete its $18.9 billion [acquisition of CA Technologies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-ca-technologies-acquisition/), a major supplier of infrastructure software.


The company raised its dividend by 51% to $2.65 per share per quarter for fiscal year 2019, which started Nov. 5. Broadcom said it made the move because its free cash flow from operations grew 50% in fiscal 2018 to $8.2 billion.

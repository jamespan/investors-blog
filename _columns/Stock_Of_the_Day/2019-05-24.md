Repligen stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) after the medical technology company "shot the lights out" in the first quarter, posting its best organic growth in three years.




Shares of the [medical technology company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/) are outperforming peers. **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) stock has climbed 27.1% year to date, through Thursday's close. Broadly, shares of medtech companies have risen 9.5% since January, as of Thursday's regular session.


The stock formed an odd cup base from a peak last November and has been trading near the 70.60 buy point. But there's been resistance at that key level, with shares unable to break through above it.


Still, the stock has been fairly constrained in the past few weeks and, remarkably, is holding up pretty well while the general market goes through a correction. Such relative strength can translate to outperformance when the market is back to an uptrend.

In the [first quarter reported May 9](https://www.snl.com/IRW/file/4325751/Index?KeyFile=397868847), the medical technology company said each of its segments grew at least 25% organically, Jefferies analyst Brandon Couillard said. The best growth came from filtration products.


"Repligen shot the lights out in the first quarter, posting its best organic growth (37%) in more than three years with strength across the portfolio," he said in a note to clients. Couillard kept his hold rating on Repligen stock, but raised his price target to 63 from 55.


Janney analyst Paul Knight was equally impressed, noting Repligen "blew out" expectations with $60.6 million in sales and adjusted earnings of 28 cents per share. Analysts expected the medical technology company to report $53.5 million in sales and profit of 21 cents a share.


Knight has a buy rating and 85 price target on Repligen stock.


Medical Technology Company Guides Up
------------------------------------


The medical technology company also raised its guidance for 2019. Now, Repligen calls for $235 million to $241 million in full-year sales, up 22%-25% organically.


William Blair analyst John Kreger expects all three Repligen segments to continue driving strong results. Notably, organic growth for protein products topped expectations and filtration product growth was north of 40%, he said in his report to clients.



"We heard nothing from management that would suggest momentum in the filtration business is expected to slow in 2019 — particularly if capital inflows to the [biotechnology industry](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) continue to fuel pipeline expansion," he said.


The medical technology company's protein business will also benefit from the acquisition of C Technologies. Privately held C Technologies is an expert in measuring protein concentration for biologic drug manufacturing.


In April, Repligen agreed to pay $240 million in a cash-and-stock deal to [buy C Technologies](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/26/1810480/0/en/Repligen-Corporation-Announces-Agreement-to-Acquire-Process-Analytics-Innovator-C-Technologies-and-Reports-Preliminary-First-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results.html). Last year, C Technologies posted $23.7 million in sales. This year, that's projected to rise to $27 million to $29 million, Repligen said in a news release.

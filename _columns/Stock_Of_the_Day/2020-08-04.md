**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it clears a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to a record high. Costco stock is actionable now, but there are reasons for investors to be cautious.




The membership wholesaler reports July sales late Wednesday. Analysts expect solid growth. The figures could be a catalyst for COST stock gains. Last month Costco stock cleared another buy point and hit a new high after releasing [surprisingly strong June sales](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/costco-stock-strong-june-sales-nears-next-buy-point-after-recent-breakout/).


But Wednesday's results could spur a Thursday's sell-off.


Separately, despite Costco stock hitting record highs, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has come well off its early April peak, signaling shares are underperforming the S&P 500 index. The RS line, the blue line in the chart, has improved slightly since early June.

More Strong Sales Seen
----------------------


Costco same-store sales likely rose 7.6% in July, or 10% excluding gas prices and foreign exchange swings, according to Consensus Metrix. Core U.S. comps should show a gain of 9.8%.


Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell expects another month of strong same-store sales. Nevertheless, he's keeping a hold rating on COST stock due to valuation concerns. His target price for the stock is 299.


"We now expect July headline comp up 8.3%, adjusted from 6.3% and vs. June up 11.5%, May up 5.4%, and April down 4.7% as we move further from the recent stimulus-driven benefit, but take into account grocery trends maintaining strength and continued sequential improvement of categories impaired by initial Covid-19 fears," he said in a July 30 research note.

Excluding FX and gas, he anticipates core same-store sales to be up 10.8%, which is a moderation on June's rise of 14.4%.


In addition, he predicted food & sundries, which made up 40% of 2019 sales, to be up in the midteens, compared to the high teens growth seen in June and May. This is due to a reduction in elevated levels of stock-up activity from consumers.







Costco Stock Analysis
---------------------


Shares gained 3.2% to 339.79 on the [stock market today.](https://investors.com/stock-market-today) That cleared a short handle-like pattern above a longer consolidation, with a 331.59 buy point. Volume was above average.


That's just above a prior entry of 325.36 as well as an aggressive buy point of 315.45.


The lackluster RS line reflects uneven Costco stock performance since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold. It moved largely sideways from April through late June while the broader market ran higher, as investors processed higher coronavirus-related costs and [fiscal third-quarter earnings that missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/costco-earnings-q3-2020-costco-stock-buy-point/). But strong June sales gave it a timely boost.



COST stock has a strong, but not ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 87. Its earnings track record is superior to its stock market performance, which is reflected in its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 88.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-costco-wholesale-corp-cost.aspx) shows EPS growth is shy of [CAN SLIM requirements](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Nevertheless, average Costco earnings growth of 18% over the past three years is still impressive for such a large company.


While investors may not want a portfolio full of slower-growing non-techs, Costco stock can provide some balance to more volatile growth names.


Among rival stocks, Sam's Club parent **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) rose 1.8% and **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) climbed 4.25%.


WMT stock is slightly below a buy point, also with a weak RS line. BJ's stock is near record highs, slightly extended from a buy zone.

**Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is a top-performing provider of optical communications systems that's carving a rare ascending base and is near a buy point.




Unlike other stock patterns such as [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) and [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), all of which are quite common, [ascending bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) are rare. But they can be powerful patterns. An ascending base usually forms after a stock has already broken out from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom pattern.


Ciena stock has a technical buy point of 40.26, with a buy range up to 42.27.


The optical gear maker's stock climbed 1.3% to close at 40.21 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The company is on the exclusive I[BD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) list of top performing stocks. Ciena stock is up 82% in the past year

Ciena designs fiber-optic switching systems that act like highway interchanges within data and telecom networks. The company could be an early beneficiary of the telecom industry buildup of [broadband 5G wireless networks](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/bullish-5g-wireless-technology-forecasts/). The 5G connections to fiber-optic networks are also expected to better enable emerging automotive, robotics and medical applications, analysts say.


Its customers include **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)).


Ciena Stock Performance
-----------------------


Ciena has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 98. That means it's outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-starbucks-corp-sbux.aspx) shows it has an EPS Rating of 93 out of a possible 99. The EPS rating tracks a company's annual and quarterly earnings growth, then measures how its numbers stack up against those of all other stocks. It also has an excellent [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength), 97 out of 99, which reflects [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) performance.


The company is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter results on March 5, before the market open. Analysts expect adjusted earnings to grow 100% from the year-ago quarter, marking a third straight quarter of acceleration. Revenue growth is seen slowing to about 18%.


Strong Quarter For Ciena
------------------------


[Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ciena-stock-ciena-earnings-q4-2018/) came in stronger than expected. The company reported adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share, up 66% from a year ago and topping estimates of 48 cents.


Revenue rose 21% to $899, above estimates of $862.4 million, for the period ended Oct. 31. It showed key improvements, including a record backlog, better-than-expected margins, and an outlook that indicates improved visibility, analysts said.


Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold, in a report on Jan. 31, maintained an outperform rating on Ciena stock with a price target of 41.


"We think Ciena benefits from foundational initiatives linked to 5G wireless," he wrote in a note to clients.


A report on Ciena from Morgan Stanley in mid-December projected that the overall fiber optic market will slow in 2019. But Ciena could continue to outpace the market, taking share with hyperscale customers, and also among new service providers.

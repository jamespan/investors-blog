**Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it races into buy range, fueled by accelerating earnings growth.







Shares rallied 2.4% to 143.96 on the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), clearing a 141.66 entry from a base-on-base-on-base pattern. That unusual chart typically means a stock is winding up for a big move, especially if the overall market has been stalling then turns higher.


Such a formation usually occurs among the strongest stocks when the general market comes under selling pressure.


Ferrari's volume Wednesday is also robust, and the stock's relative strength line on a weekly chart is confirming the breakout.


Meanwhile, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rose 0.6%, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) added 0.6%, **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) dipped 0.7%, and **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) lost 0.6%. Ferrari's Auto Manufacturers stock group is ranked 119, but it has been improving.



Since [being spun off](https://www.investors.com/news/fiat-chrysler-surges-on-ferrari-spinoff-plan/) by Fiat Chrysler in 2016, Ferrari has been a consistent strong performer due to the popularity of its high-end performance vehicles.


While it is known for its sports cars, it is also the oldest and most successful team in Formula One. Its Scuderia Ferrari team has won 16 constructors titles and 15 drivers titles. Its sporting heritage is a driver for the brand's prestige.


Ferrari has been enjoying accelerating earnings and revenue growth in recent quarters. In the last quarter it scored a double beat as EPS rose to 96 cents and revenue jumped to $1.02 billion. Shipments were up 6.2% to 2,128 vehicles.

Ferrari Fundamentals
--------------------


Ferrari has green lights in two key categories. It holds an impressive [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 97 and a good [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 89. But its [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/eps-rating) of 88, which measures a company's earnings-per-share growth on both a current and annual basis, just fails to pass muster.


The stock is also leading its [automakers industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-12-2018/), which is improving as a whole after a period of struggle.

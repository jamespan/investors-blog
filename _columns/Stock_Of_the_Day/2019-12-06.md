Mexican fast-casual chain **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Chipotle stock has settled into a consolidation, after gliding higher for much of the year, as Wall Street bets on digitally-driven gains for the company.




Chipotle Stock
--------------


That consolidation, begun in September, has an 858 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Chipotle stock rose 0.3% to 822.48 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). CMG stock did briefly clear a short handle with an 825.70 entry on Friday, but the tepid, light volume move didn't last. Also, the handle doesn't appear on a weekly chart. So the left hand side of the consolidation is the most likely true resistance point right now for Chipotle stock.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has eased since late August, meaning Chipotle stock has lagged the S&P 500 index over that time, but that follows a 10-month run of outperformance. Shares found support at the 200-day line on Nov. 11. CMG stock on Nov. 26 reclaimed support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Chipotle stock has a 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 73 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/).


Chipotle earnings have been very strong, rising 28%, 60%, 39% and 77% in the last four quarters. Continued strong growth is expected for Q4, with analysts expecting Chipotle earnings to grow 29% next year after this year's forecast 53% surge. Sales growth over the past nine quarters has expanded from single-digit growth to growth in the low-to-mid teens.


Chipotle stock sold off after its last earnings report, despite beating views, as the company warned of slower store openings as it [focuses on drive-thru "Chipotlanes."](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q3-2019-due-chipotle-stock-buy-point/)

Best Idea For Next Year?
------------------------


Trends for the company have rebounded since last year, after Chipotle stock fell from 2015 through last year as it struggled to put food-safety issues behind it.


Chipotle stock was named one of Cowen's best ideas for 2020 late last month. At that time, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles upgraded CMG stock to outperform and raised his price target to $970 from $800.


"Our confidence is predicated on a growing mix of digital sales for pickup and third-party delivery that our fast casual benchmarking work suggests has room to nearly double from 18% of sales today to 34% in the next 5 years," Charles wrote in a research note.


He added that Chipotle stock could move higher on new menu additions, after success with carne asada and lifestyle bowls. Charles also said the company is looking to raise the quality of the beverages it serves to align with its "food with integrity" mantra.


However, he said the stock's lofty valuation is "the most obvious risk, placing increased pressure for results to meet or beat expectations."


Other Restaurant Stocks
-----------------------


Among other restaurant stocks, **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), down 0.1% to 286.57, is in a big [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) on a daily chart, according to [Marketsmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). On a weekly chart, Domino's stock is in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), which starts at middle of the double-bottom pattern. In both cases, a newly formed handle offers a 299.08 buy point.


Chipotle stands out vs. the likes of Domino's, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and many other chains, which are reporting single-digit earnings growth or declining profits.


The bullishness around Chipotle's fast-food prospects for delivery comes as fast-food delivery competition heats up. A growing number of third-party deliverers have pressured the likes of Domino's and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)).


Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney, on the company's most recent earnings conference call, said delivery had become "commoditized."


Grubhub stock was up 2.1% on Friday, but has tumbled more than 70% from its September 2018 peak.

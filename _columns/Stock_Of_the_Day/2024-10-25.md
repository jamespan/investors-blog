**On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the fast-growing athletic apparel company offered a buying opportunity after rebounding off a key support level and punching through a downtrend.


Founded in 2010, the Swiss company behind the popular On Running shoes decided to expand globally at a measured pace, entering Germany in 2011, then the U.S. and Japan in 2013. The company moved into China and Brazil in 2018. Now, On Holding also has high-profile partnerships â€” including such notables as Roger Federer and Zendaya.


The footwear and apparel maker went public with a stock price of 24 in September 2021. It currently trades 110% above that price, and just below its record high from November 2021.




On Aug. 13, On Holding reported second-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share, just short of FactSet views for 19 cents. Revenue leapt 29% to a record $653.8 million, ending a string of five quarters of decelerating sales growth.


The company also maintained its full-year forecast for at least 30% net sales growth on a constant currency basis. That implies net sales of about $2.65 billion.


Meanwhile, the consensus view has Q3 profit at 22 cent per share, running flat compared to a year ago, while sales are expected to grow 32% to $711 million. Analysts project On Holding to report third-quarter financials in November.


For the full year, analysts see earnings surging 147% to 99 cents a share, according to FactSet. Looking ahead, predictions have earnings of $2.51 per share by 2028, a 527% jump from 2023 levels.


On Holding is challenging athletic footwear and apparel stalwarts like **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)), Hoka-parent **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) and others.

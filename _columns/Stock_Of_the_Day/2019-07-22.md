As chip stocks such as **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **AMD** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and memory specialist **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) rallied in recent days and weeks, one of the biggest challenges for investors was how to take part in the rally. AMD stock has been a group leader, but is extended from a buy point. Intel stock and Micron stock are rallying off the bottom.




One way to avoid stock-specific risk is to opt for an ETF, which offers a diversified portfolio of stocks. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it sits in buy zone while the sector charges higher.


Chip Stocks Show Strength In Uncertain Market
---------------------------------------------


Chip stocks were big winners to start the year on hopes for a semiconductor industry recovery in the second half of 2019. But in May chip stocks were notable losers due to the escalating China trade war and the U.S. ban on Huawei. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), an important partner for the Chinese telecoms firm, recently warned about the outlook for the second half of 2019, citing continued geopolitical uncertainties. That, along with other factors, raised doubts about an industry rebound this year.


Chip stocks have rebounded again on a China trade war truce, with President Donald Trump pledging to ease the U.S. ban on Huawei.


Last week Dutch equipment maker **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) soared on earnings despite weak guidance. **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) also delivered strong results last week, with the chip foundry calling an industry bottom.


"We have also passed the bottom of the cycle of our business and began to see demand increases," Taiwan Semiconductor CFO Lora Ho said.

Goldman Hails Micron Stock, Memory Revival
------------------------------------------


The sector got another boost Monday when Goldman Sachs upgraded Micron stock from neutral to buy and hiked its price target to 56 from 40.


Analyst Mark Delaney said he is now "more positive on global memory stocks" due to recent industry trends.


"We now believe that inventory at the memory companies ... is being depleted faster than we previously expected. In addition, we continue to expect the underlying rate of production to fall below longer-term demand growth in 2020," he said in a research note.


Goldman Sachs also upgraded several chip equipment makers, some of which are big suppliers to Micron and other memory players.


AMD Stock Is Group Leader
-------------------------


Among leading chip names, AMD stock is extended. Shares rose just over 1% on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been making good progress since October. AMD stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 83, with its strong stock market performance reflected in its Relative Strength Rating of 97.


Intel stock is in the midst of a consolidation. While starting to move up the right side of a base, Intel stock remains far from a buy point. The Dow Jones tech giant only recently retook its 200-day line. Intel earnings are due Thursday night.


**Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) reports Tuesday night with 5G chipmaker **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) due late Wednesday, and Intel earnings slated for Thursday. Other chipmakers due to report in the coming week include **Silicon Laboratories** ([SLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLAB)), **STMicroelectronics** ([STM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STM)) and **Power Integrations** ([POWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWI)).


Buying a stock ahead of earnings is very risky. Owning a group or sector ETF like SMH provides an opportunity to get exposure to the sector during earnings season.


Some unexpected events have also delivered momentum, such as last month's power outage at a Japanese plant run by Toshiba, which reduced NAND flash memory supply. There are also supply worries due to trade tensions between Japan and South Korea. These led to the Japanese putting export controls on materials key to the production of chips. With no clear resolution in sight there are fears DRAM titans Samsung and Hynix may have to scale back on production.


IBD Stock Of The Day Reduces Risk
---------------------------------


The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF aims to match the price and yield performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. This is a pure-play index made up of firms engaged primarily in the production of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.


Top holdings for SMH include the likes of Intel stock, AMD stock, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), Texas Instruments stock and Taiwan Semiconductor stock.


Nvidia stock closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since last October. Texas Instruments is in buy range from a cup-with-handle base. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is closing on a buy point in a cup base.


The five stocks from AMD to Texas Instruments mentioned above make up about 40% of the ETF's assets. SMH is up 36% so far in 2019.


SMH ETF Technical Analysis
--------------------------


The SMH ETF rose 2% to 118.82 in Monday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/), in buy zone from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) base. The entry point is 116.06, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been making progress, moving well above its handle high and nearing its consolidation peak. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, tracks the performance of a stock or ETF vs. the S&P 500 index.



Investors can buy an ETF like a stock, via breakouts. Buying ETFs after pullbacks to key support levels also is an option.


The SMH ETF is faring slightly better than iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)), which is the biggest semiconductor ETF by assets. This fund is up 35% so far in 2019, and cleared its own cup-with-handle buy point of 208.87 on Monday. While the two funds tend to share many of the same stocks, SMH holds fewer names (25 vs. 30) and skews more global than SOXX.


Investors with conviction in the space will have done well, with the triple-leveraged Direxion Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares ETF ([SOXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXL)) up 113% so far this year. SOXL also moved above a buy point, this one at 171.70, on Monday.


Keep in mind that chip stocks are volatile. Buying an ETF like SMH or SOXX will reduce stock-specific risk but won't avoid big group swings. That's especially true of the triple-levered SOXL ETF.

**Yatsen Holding** ([YSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YSG)), which sells beauty and skin care products in China, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) — [for the second time in roughly three weeks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/yatsen-stock-near-ipo-base-buy-point-china-beauty-market/). Yatsen stock surged through a buy zone on Wednesday, and was holding up on Thursday.




However, even as YSG stock hovers in buy territory, IBD advises investors to tread lightly.


Yatsen Stock
------------


Yatsen stock fell 3.8% to 21.36 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), pulling back into the buy zone. However, on Wednesday, shares jumped 17%, clearing a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 21.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis shows. It's a first-ever consolidation so it qualifies as an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/). YSG stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) is just off highs.


However, investors are advised to take a small position at first. Like many IPOs, Yatsen, which went public in November, has been volatile. YSG stock has had several double-digit daily moves in its brief history.



Yatsen Sales Growth Strong
--------------------------


Yatsen stock has a 41 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is weaker at 7, out of a possible 99, as the company lost money through most of last year. Analysts expect more losses this year.


However, sales have grown rapidly, up 75% in the latest quarter to $186.5 million. Analysts attribute the gains to its digitally oriented business, which sells to customers directly and has proved popular with China's younger customers. Yatsen has said that model is new to China's beauty market.


Yaten's flagship brand is Perfect Diary, a color cosmetics line. Yatsen also sells Little Ondine, an eyeliner and mascara brand, and Abby's Choice, a moisturizing-mask maker.


Goldman Sachs analyst Christine Cho, who covers Yatsen stock, said sales of those and other beauty products will depend on social media.


"A key driver behind the rapid online beauty sales will be the rise of social e-commerce which integrates social platforms with e-commerce capabilities, such as WeChat, TikTok, Bilibili and Kuaishou, in our view," she said in a research note in December.


However, Yatsen marketing expenses, she noted, could stay high, which could hurt profitability.


Several top Fidelity funds own Yatsen stock, a positive sign of institutional support.

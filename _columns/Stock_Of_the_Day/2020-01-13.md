**Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)), a fertility benefits manager, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). A profitable recent IPO, Progyny stock is racing toward a new buy point, amid hopes that workplace fertility coverage will go mainstream.




Progyny Stock Sets Up
---------------------


Shares spiked 8.7% to 31.81 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). Progyny stock is working toward a 32.10 buy point of a short consolidation. If PGNY stock stays within the current price range this week, it will have formed a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


After launching out of the gates in October, when it debuted, Progyny stock formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) in November. Third-quarter Progyny earnings, reported after the close on Dec. 4, beat expectations. [Progyny stock jumped](https://www.investors.com/news/progyny-stock-progyny-earnings-q3-2019-ipo-base-buy-point/) on Dec. 5, breaking out to a record 32 on Dec. 6


But Progyny stock reversed sharply lower the next session, ultimately sliding to 22.90 on Dec. 19. Since then shares, have rebounded. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Progyny stock is close to record highs.


The relative strength line gauges a stock's performance against the S&P 500. When the line rises, the stock is beating the benchmark index.


Shares have a 68 [Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader). Progyny stock's [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 24. The so-so Composite Rating and woeful EPS Rating reflect the lack of long-term earnings. However, the company is profitable, making it the rare IPO to actually debut in the black. Analysts expect Progyny earnings to surge 190% in 2020.


Revenue growth has been in the triple digits for the last six quarters.


'Tipping Point' For Coverage?
-----------------------------


Progyny offers treatment plans that help people at large employers — **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Google being among the biggest — achieve pregnancy.


As a December [IBD New America profile on Progyny](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/progyny-stock-ipo-fertililty-treatment/) noted, couples are waiting longer to have children. Single mothers and same-sex couples increasingly want to have children as well.


"Employers are waking up and saying, 'Look, if we want to be viewed positively, as the type of employer that values its female workforce, that values its other employee populations like the LGBT population, like single moms by choice, we should be providing benefits like this,' " Progyny CEO David Schlanger told IBD.


Progyny tries to remove barriers to coverage — like authorization requirements and cost limits — that restrict fertility treatment under traditional plans. The company faces competition from other startups, and could face steeper competition from large health insurers, like **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)).


But some analysts say competing with Progyny would require health insurance giants to significantly redesign their benefit plans and rethink how they do business.


"By the time (managed care organizations) enter the market in a meaningful way, we think it would be cheaper for them to buy PGNY rather than build themselves," SVB Leerink analyst Daniel Grosslight said in a recent note.

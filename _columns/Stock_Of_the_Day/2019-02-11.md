Insperity stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after strong earnings and guidance sent shares of the outsourcing specialist flying above a buy point.




The Texas-based human resources and payroll services provider bested analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines. **Insperity** ([NSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSP)) earnings per share jumped 25% to 69 cents, 4 cents better than consensus views, as revenue vaulted 17% to $967 million, edging above estimates for $964 million.

"As a result of our successful fall selling and retention campaign, we are starting 2019 with 15% worksite employee growth and are well-positioned to continue our strong financial performance," CEO Paul Sarvadi said in a news release.

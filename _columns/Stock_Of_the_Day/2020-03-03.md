**RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) has plenty in common with red-hot **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)). For one, both RingCentral stock and Zoom stock have shot up this year.




Two, neither stock has faltered in the face of the rapidly spreading China coronavirus. The reason is both offer communications software that sets up meetings over the internet, now in demand as travel has been limited.


And three, Zoom was an [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/zm-stock-climbs-on-coronavirus-spread-with-earnings-guidance-due-next-week/) one week ago. Today, it's RingCentral's turn as [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


RingCentral stock is extended from a 178.09 entry point, soaring by 40% thus far this year. Shares ended Monday trading at 239.89, up 1.8% for the day.


Still, now it could be forming a new base that provides a fresh buying opportunity. It will take at least a few more weeks to identify a pattern. So far, the price consolidation is shallow enough to become a flat base.

RingCentral's software lets customers set up business meetings using voice calls. The software also enables customers to integrate chat, app, and other workplace collaboration tools.


Belmont, Calif.-based RingCentral has made it easier for companies to set up business meetings using its product.


RingCentral Stock: Video To Create Competition?
-----------------------------------------------


But now a rivalry brews with Zoom. RingCentral has quietly developed its own videoconferencing product to rival that of Zoom's. A Morgan Stanley analyst commented on the budding rivalry between the two companies in early February after attending a user conference hosted by **Avaya Holdings** ([AVYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVYA)). Avaya is a new sales channel partner for RingCentral.


At the conference, Avaya signaled that its new business meeting software platform would use RingCentral's video tools, displacing Zoom. RingCentral has yet to launch its video solution commercially. But it's coming "sooner rather than later" Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall said in a recent note to clients.


"While we expect that RNG's video solution will be impressive, we believe Zoom's video product will continue to be the premier product in the market," Marshall said in the report. He added while "Zoom's current revenue trajectory and valuation can be sustained, but would expect competitive questions to linger."


Zoom on March 3 announced that its phone product is available in 11 more countries, bringing the total to 17.


"We have a very good partnership with Zoom," said RingCentral spokeswoman Mariana Leventis in an email. "In cloud software, coopetition is a very standard model as it gives customers maximum choice. With a massive $50 billion market opportunity,  different vendors are approaching the market from different areas. For example, Zoom with video-first approach and RingCentral with cloud PBX-first approach. So different swim lanes with some overlap."


Boosted By Avaya Announcement
-----------------------------


RingCentral stock, meanwhile, has been boosted by the Avaya alliance announced in early October and an expanded distribution deal with **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)).


Prior to the Avaya announcement, RingCentral stock had consolidated with an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) of 146.48. RingCentral stock jumped some 46% over several trading sessions in the wake of the Avaya deal.


More companies are ditching decades-old internal calling centers and switching to cloud-based communications systems hosted in remote data centers. RingCentral customers access its services via high-speed internet connections.


Further, that's where the Avaya alliance comes in. Incumbents such as Avaya manage communications gear at customer locations. RingCentral will have the inside track to sell its remote, cloud-based products to Avaya's large customer base.


RingCentral Maintaining A Startup Mentality
-------------------------------------------


One of the reasons for RingCentral's success is the insistence by Chief Executive Vlad Shmunis to maintain a startup mentality at the company. Shmunis started the company with just a handful of people in 1999 and has grown it steadily to 2,000 employees in more than 100 countries.


"We have a fairly large company now and it would certainly not be possible for me, or for anyone, to run it in a top-down hierarchical manner," Shmunis said in a [recent interview with Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/ringcentral-ceo-vlad-shmunis-dials-up-a-startup-mentality/). "We try to get people to be their own bosses and I think it is working."


RingCentral officials did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.


That came in handy as the company's stock stayed upright through the coronavirus crisis. After the company reported earnings on Nov. 4, RingCentral software stock again consolidated through the end of 2019, forming a new buy point of 178.09. By mid-January, shares in RingCentral were extended amid lofty historical valuations for many software stocks.


RingCentral Stock Prospers
--------------------------


As investors tracked the spread of the coronavirus from China to other countries, RingCentral stock and Zoom stock gained in early February. Since Feb. 20, though, RingCentral stock has cooled off as analysts weigh its valuation and upside from the coronavirus, also called Covid-19.


When RingCentral reported earnings on Feb. 10, it forecast 2020 revenue in a range of $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion, above estimates of $1.097 billion. RingCentral didn't mention the coronavirus on its earnings call with analysts, according to a transcript.

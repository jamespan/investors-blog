The new **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)), armed with midband spectrum from its merger with Sprint, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). T-Mobile stock popped on Friday after the wireless service provider reported second-quarter earnings, updated guidance and told analysts it's ready to rumble with rivals **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)).




Ahead of the T-Mobile earnings report, the stock forged a new proper entry point of 111.68 coming out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). T-Mobile stock moved into a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) Friday as shares jumped 6.5% to close at 115.09.


T-Mobile stock owns a solid [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 82 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). That means it has outperformed 82% of all other stocks. The best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of at least 80.


T-Mobile stock also has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of B-minus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock during the prior 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.

T-Mobile stock has surged over 35% since its merger with Sprint closed on April 1.


T-Mobile Stock: Spectrum Edge Boosts 5G Network
-----------------------------------------------


The new T-Mobile owns more radio spectrum than AT&T or Verizon. That could provide an important edge as [5G wireless services](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/) are rolled out.


Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft initiated coverage of T-Mobile on July 29 with a buy rating.


"We believe T-Mobile has a massive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and free cash flow growth opportunity in front of it â€” driven by merger synergies, improved scale, an industry-leading spectrum position, a turnaround of the legacy Sprint operations, and continued subscriber momentum in the pre-existing T-Mobile operations," Kraft said.


RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin, though, downgraded T-Mobile stock to sector perform on July 28. He says investors have already priced long-term merger synergies into T-Mobile's valuation.


In addition, Atkin says aggressive promotional offerings are expected when the new T-Mobile/Sprint launches a combined brand this month. Competition will likely intensify even more when **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) launches 5G iPhones early in the fourth quarter.


Postpaid Phone Subscriber Growth Leads Industry
-----------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, T-Mobile continues to lead the wireless services market in subscriber and revenue growth.


In the June quarter, T-Mobile added 253,000 high-spending postpaid phone customers, the most among the big three wireless firms. The wireless firm has forecast postpaid net adds in a range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million in the second half of 2020.


T-Mobile has been a subscriber and revenue share gainer since late 2013 when it unleashed its "Uncarrier"-branded marketing campaign along with aggressive price discounts. T-Mobile also upgraded its wireless network, closing a performance gap with Verizon.


Much of the management team that led T-Mobile's revival, however, is gone. Chief Executive John Legere and Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter left after the Sprint deal closed. T-Mobile's new CEO is Mike Sievert, who also led the "Uncarrier" branding campaign.


When reporting earnings on Aug. 6, T-Mobile said it has overtaken AT&T as the second-biggest U.S. wireless services provider. T-Mobile said it has 98.3 million subscribers post-merger. AT&T recently reported nearly 93 million subscribers, but it counts customers and lines differently.


Migrating Sprint Customers To T-Mobile Network Is Key
-----------------------------------------------------


With the merger closed, one goal is reducing customer turnover at Sprint.


The key to that is improving service quality by shifting Sprint subscribers to T-Mobile's network, analysts say. T-Mobile says 10% of Sprint subscribers have already been moved to its network.


"The migration will free up enormous amounts of capacity, which can be turned to the 5G opportunity and what we strongly believe will be network advantage versus Verizon and AT&T," MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a report published Thursday. "That, in turn, should translate to further share gains, particularly in enterprise, and with greater scale and higher margins."


T-Mobile on Aug. 6 said it expects between $800 million and $1 billion in merger-related expenses in the second half of 2020. The company forecast cash EBITDA in a range of $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion in the second half of 2020, up about 4% from the year-earlier period.


Former Sprint-parent SoftBank offloaded most of its stake in the new T-Mobile as expected in June. Debt-laden SoftBank needed to raise cash. **Deutsche Telekom** ([DTEGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DTEGY)) is poised to increase its stake in the new T-Mobile to more than 50% from 44% under a complex deal. Deutsche Telekom's options run through June 2024.

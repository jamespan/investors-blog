The **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) F-150 continues to be red-hot with consumers, and it's one reason why **Ingevity** ([NGVT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NGVT)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The maker of specialty chemicals and carbon materials seeks to commercialize adsorbed natural gas (ANG) for vehicles, capitalizing on the global push toward sustainable fleets.







Ingevity began trading publicly as a tax-free spinoff of **Westrock** ([WRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRK)), formerly MeadWestvaco, in May 2016.


As an independent company, Ingevity gained flexibility to expand its focus from paper and packaging materials to asphalt paving, oil exploration and production, agrochemicals, adhesives, lubricants, printing inks — and automotive components to reduce gasoline vapor emissions.


In August, Ingevity showed off one of its two 2018 bi-fuel Ford F-150 trucks at the Sustainable Fleet Technology Conference in North Carolina. Based on ANG technology, they greatly enhance onboard natural gas fuel storage compared with peers running on compressed natural gas.


ANG storage cylinders, located in the bed of the Ford trucks, contain Ingevity's FuelSorb carbon "monoliths."


Shares dipped 0.3% to 99.87 in Wednesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), but are just below their all-time intraday high and have been trading tightly as they test support at the 10-week moving average.


Ingevity also has delivered a roughly 20% gain to investors who bought the stock as it cleared an 83.80 cup-with-handle buy point 10 weeks ago.


The stock boasts solid fundamentals, which are reflected in its superior [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 94. But bear in mind it has already risen by around 56% from a closing mark of 64.05 this time last year, reducing the odds for another big run-up.


The relative strength line is near a 52-week peak but average volume has been light in the past 50 days.

Ingevity Earnings
-----------------


The South Carolina-based company has beaten Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines for the last seven quarters.


In July, Ingevity reported net sales of $308.6 million, up more than 18% vs. a year ago. Diluted adjusted earnings per share jumped 44% to $1.12.


But analysts see annual earnings vaulting more than 40% to $3.72 in 2018 and then accelerating roughly 25% to $4.67 in 2019.


Annual EPS growth above 25% for the past three years is a key [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) requirement.

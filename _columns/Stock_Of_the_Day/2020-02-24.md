Shares in **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), climbed again Monday despite a global market sell-off sparked by fears over the rapidly spreading China coronavirus. ZM stock has soared on views that less business travel will increase demand for its videoconferencing products.




Zoom stock rose 3.2% to to close at 105.01 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). With the gain, ZM stock moved above a 107.44 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after forming a deep cup chart pattern over eight months. The Zoom rally began in late January amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus known as Covid-19.


Buying a stock on a big [gap-up gain](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) sometimes can be a sound investing strategy. However, there are reasons to be cautious on Zoom stock, with earnings and guidance due next week.


The Zoom initial public offering in April 2019 raised $752 million, with shares priced at 36. After a huge run through mid-June, ZM stock swooned in the back half of 2019.

Zoom stock corrected 43% while forming the deep cup base. Not many stocks roar back after such a run and steep correction. It usually takes time for them to digest those gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs.


ZM Stock: Guidance Expected Amid Coronavirus Spread
---------------------------------------------------


In addition, investors should be cautious ahead of Zoom earnings, which are due out on March 4. [Options trading](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/19/options-trader-bets-zoom-video-run-higher-may-just-be-getting-started.html) on Zoom stock has increased ahead of the earnings report. And Zoom stock could be volatile after it reports earnings.


Further, buying shares in a broad market sell-off isn't advised. Zoom insiders have been selling the stock amid the big run-up tied to the China coronavirus. Chief Executive Eric Yuan sold $12.5 million in stock at an average price of 89.17 on Feb. 13, [said one report](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1039845/zoom-video-communications-inc-zm-ceo-eric-s-yuan-sold-125-million-of-shares).


ZM stock hit an all-time intraday high of 110.75 on Feb. 20.


The company's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to jump 250% to 7 cents a share. Company revenue will soar 67% to $176.5 million, analysts estimate.


Zoom management commentary on the coronavirus, which continues to spread outside of China, will be key. Zoom also is expected to issue full-year 2020 guidance.


South Korea has raised its threat level to "red alert," the highest national threat level. Outside of Asia, Italy has been the hotbed for the virus.


Salesforce.com An Investor In Zoom Stock
----------------------------------------


San Jose, Calif.-based Zoom gets about 20% of revenues outside the U.S. Zoom's cloud-based software sets up audio and videoconferencing, with chat tools also available. Customers also can easily share content.


Zoom competes with **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Skype for business, as well as LogMeIn and Fuze.


Aside from research and development in the U.S., Zoom has engineering staff in China.


**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) invested $100 million in the company just before the ZM stock April IPO.


Salesforce, a leader in software-as-a-service, first partnered with Zoom in 2015. Zoom's tools also work with **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), data-storage firm **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) and others.


'Freemium' Business Model
-------------------------


One key to Zoom's success has been a "freemium" business model. It lowers the cost of customer acquisition.


Zoom's basic video-calling package is free. Zoom puts limits of the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings. Paid Zoom plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats.

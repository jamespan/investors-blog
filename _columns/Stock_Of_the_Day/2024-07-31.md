Texas Roadhouse is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. Shares are trading in a narrow range near a buy point atop a 43% rally so far this year.




**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) is coming off another strong quarterly beat that marked three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth.


The Louisville, Ky.-based restaurant chain on July 25 reported a 47% increase in earnings to $1.79 per share, clearing views for $1.64. Total revenue jumped 14.5% to $1.341 billion. FactSet expected $1.338 billion in revenue.


Comparable sales at Texas Roadhouse company locations rose 9.3% for the quarter, outpacing estimates of 9% growth. Domestic franchise restaurants saw same-store sales increase 8.3%.


Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales also improved, to 18.2% from 15.7% last year, primarily driven by higher sales. The company noted it benefited from higher average customer checks and improved labor productivity.


Average weekly sales at restaurants during the quarter rose 8.4% to $158,991. Meanwhile, average to-go weekly sales climbed nearly 8% to $19,975.


CEO Jerry Morgan noted that strong traffic trends and "some" relief on commodity inflation led to higher profitability across all its brands.


Texas Roadhouse reported that company restaurants saw an 8% increase in comparable sales during the first four weeks of Q3 compared with last year.


However, restaurant stocks in general have struggled over the past few months. The likes of **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), **Cava Group** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) and **Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)) have pulled back after hitting record highs in June.


Meanwhile, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and Olive Garden-parent Darden **Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)) are [among those that have tumbled this year on slowing traffic and higher food prices](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-restaurants-cava-sweetgreen-mcdonalds-starbucks-inflation/).

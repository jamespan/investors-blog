**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as more than a dozen Wall Street analysts initiated coverage on the cybersecurity services company Monday. CrowdStrike stock initially surged on the news but ended the day lower.




The widespread initiation on CrowdStrike follows the end of a self-imposed quiet period after its [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-ipo-prices-shares-above-raised-views/) on June 11. The IPO priced CrowdStrike stock at 34, above an already-raised price range. The stock jumped 71% on its first day of trading and raised $612 million.


CrowdStrike stock climbed for much of the session on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), but ended the day down 0.5% to 66.91.


Wall Street price targets for CrowdStrike stock range from 66 to 90. The majority have a rating of buy or outperform.

Founded in 2011, the company maintains its base in Sunnyvale, Calif. Its mission is to "reinvent security for the cloud era" and claims to take a fundamentally new approach to cloud-based security. It leverages the network effects of crowdsourced data with artificial intelligence and cloud computing.


"We believe we are defining a new category called the Security Cloud, with the power to transform the security industry," the company said in the [CrowdStrike IPO filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1535527/000104746919003508/a2238988zs-1a.htm#ca10701_prospectus_summary) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Realizing that the nature of cybersecurity problems had changed but the solutions had not, we built our CrowdStrike Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches."


CrowdStrike Stock Action
------------------------


CrowdStrike stock hit a record high of 79.79 on June 19. Shares fell back to 61.17 on June 25, then began to steady. CrowdStrike now sits in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), with a 79.89 buy point.


When it comes to investing in IPO stocks, new issues don't play by the usual rules. Learn these time-proven rules on [when to buy IPOs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), as well as when to sell shares to maximize profits and minimize losses.


Investors studying IPO bases have to operate partially blind. New issues don't have enough trading history to generate some IBD tools. So an Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as compiled in IBD's proprietary research tool, [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), doesn't exist yet. Volume comparisons are difficult, too.


What CrowdStrike does have is an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 66 out of a best-possible 99. It also has a Relative Strength Rating of 92 out of 99, which measures the performance of its shares against those of other stocks. Plus, CrowdStrike rates highly among several top-performing companies in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group. The group ranks 14th out of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-27-2018/).


The leading stock in software security group is **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), followed by **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)). CrowdStrike is No. 15 out of 33 companies in the group, according to the Stock Checkup.


FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi initiated coverage Monday with a rating of outperform and price target on CrowdStrike of 80.


"We estimate that CrowdStrike will be growing its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 46%, about five times the growth rate of its total addressable market," Seyrafi said in a note to clients. He estimates the market is around $25 billion.


CrowdStrike Revenue Growth
--------------------------


CrowdStrike primarily competes in the $6.9 billion endpoint security market. He says it consistently ranks as the top priority for investment among chief information officers.


In fiscal 2019, CrowdStrike reported revenue of $250 million. That was up 110% from the year-ago period, with a net loss of $140 million. Revenue has grown at a triple-digit rate for seven of the last eight quarters. It will report fiscal first quarter results on July 18 after the market close.


Oppenheimer analyst Shaul Eyal initiated coverage on CrowdStrike with a rating of outperform and price target of 90. His bullish stance is based on CrowdStrike's "innovative technology which layers on artificial intelligence and machine learning to crowdsourced threat intelligence to stay ahead of adversaries," he wrote in his report to clients.


Eyal thinks CrowdStrike will continue to disrupt competitors and gain market share.

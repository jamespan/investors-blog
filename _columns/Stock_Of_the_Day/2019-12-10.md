**AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as same-store sales growth accelerated. AutoZone earnings for the fiscal first quarter beat Wall Street estimates Tuesday, with management affirming healthy fundamentals in the auto parts retail industry. Intraday Tuesday, AutoZone stock cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), while rival **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) trades bullishly.




Auto parts retailer AutoZone's Q1 beat defied investor concerns about macro and trade risks. Sales rose 5.7% for the quarter, a slowdown from 12% growth the prior quarter. But domestic same-store sales gained 3.4%, an improvement from 3% growth in the prior quarter.


Among future growth drivers, AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes cited initiatives to improve inventory, drive DIY sales and increase commercial sales "substantially faster than industry growth."


AutoZone Stock
--------------


Shares jumped 6.9% to 1,250 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), setting a record high intraday of 1274.41. AutoZone stock topped a 1,186.70 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) buy point. It's just barely extended from the 5% chase zone, which extends to 1,246.04.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is also making a new high, which is a bullish sign. The RS line tracks AutoZone stock's performance against the S&P 500. It's the blue line in the chart provided.


One upside for AutoZone, as well as O'Reilly stock, is that both showed impressive action during the late 2018 stock market correction. Bull market or bear, Americans still need to fix up their cars.



The overall [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), combining key fundamental and technical metrics, is a mediocre 70 out of 99. That's due in part to a slowdown in earnings growth, though Tuesday's AutoZone stock action should help.


AutoZone stock's EPS Rating of 90 is above the minimum 80 or higher that investors would want to see. Earnings growth averaged 13% over the past three years, which is decent for a large-cap stock like AutoZone.


For Q1, AutoZone earnings per share climbed 6.2% to $14.30, though that was the fourth straight quarter of slowing growth. Sales rose 5.7% to $2.79 billion. Analysts had expected AutoZone earnings per share of $13.69 and sales of $2.76 billion. In the prior quarter, AutoZone earnings jumped 22% and sales rose 12%. Analysts have expected an 8% EPS increase in all of fiscal 2020, followed by a 9% gain in fiscal 2021.



Auto Parts Retailers Rally
--------------------------


AutoZone's surge Tuesday lifted most other auto parts retail stocks. O'Reilly stock gained 0.5% to 441.90,**Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) popped 3%. **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) faded to lose 0.2%. **Monro** ([MNRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNRO)), which got an upgrade from Guggenheim, jumped 3.5%.


O'Reilly stock is extended from a 407.30 flat-base entry cleared in October. Shares have been almost flat for weeks but are trading tightly, with a potential 454.41 entry. O'Reilly stock has outperformed AutoZone stock over the long term.


AutoZone Fending Off Amazon Threat
----------------------------------


AutoZone has been making investments in wages and technology to help employees sell more efficiently, according to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.


Concerns about the potential for **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) to take share have declined meaningfully from two years ago, the analysts wrote in October.


The Amazon threat whacked AutoZone stock and other auto parts retailers broadly in 2017.


AutoZone has not yet experienced meaningful cost pressure from tariffs from President Donald Trump's trade war, Bank of America added. But the auto parts retailer has raised pricing on products where costs have risen.

Discount retailer **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Dollar General stock has traded tightly over the past few weeks following a breakout and is potentially setting up another buying opportunity.




Among specialty discounters, **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) is just below a buy point, while **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) is showing similar action. So is big-box discounter **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), while **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is in a buy range.


Dollar General Stock
--------------------


Shares of Dollar General broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) on Aug. 29 after the chain reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales that beat Wall Street expectations. Dollar General also raised its full-year sales outlook.


After an 11% earnings gap on Aug 29, Dollar General stock kept rising to 162.34 on Sept. 9. Since then, shares have been consolidating tightly but for not long enough to be a proper base. Still, investors could treat 162.44 as an entry point.



Shares rose 1.6% to 158.71 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today).


Dollar General stock has a 92 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measures accelerating profitability, stands at 88. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is just off its early September peak.


Analysts say a strong economy and minimum-wage increases in many parts of the U.S. have given the discount consumer more spending power. The dollar stores tend to be smaller and closer to consumers than **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), making them more convenient for quick grocery stops. Dollar General also has introduced a new program geared toward stocking more of its stores with fresh food.


BMO analyst Kelly Bania also notes that Dollar General's more upbeat full-year forecast included the impact of U.S. tariffs on some goods from China. The forecast from rival **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), Bania said, did not.


Discount Retail Stocks Remain Solid
-----------------------------------


Dollar Tree stock has a 75 Composite Rating and a 58 EPS Rating. The stock is consolidating and rebounding from a dip in August. Shares rose 2.1% to 113.42 on Monday, just below a 113.47 buy point. Dollar Tree stock hit 113.94 intraday.



IBD's Retail Discount & Variety industry group, of which the dollar stores are a member, holds a ranking of No. 73 out of the 197 groups tracked. Weaker performances from stores like **Ollie's** **Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) have dragged the group lower.


However, **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), a discount retailer geared toward teens and tweens, has a 96 Composite Rating and a 93 EPS Rating. The stock's relative strength line has flagged somewhat this year, after a long run higher that began in 2016.


Five Below stock climbed 1.4% to 128.27 on Monday. Shares have a 138.06 handle buy point.


Burlington Stores stock reversed lower, closing down 0.8%. It's been consolidating near record highs since the end of August following the off-price apparel retailer's own strong earnings report.


Meanwhile, among discount giants, Target stock rose 2%, consolidating near record highs after surging on earnings. Walmart stock climbed 0.55%, right at record highs and still in buy range.

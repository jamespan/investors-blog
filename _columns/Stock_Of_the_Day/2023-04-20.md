**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker prepares for an expected PC sales recovery in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, AMD stock has found support at a key level.




In afternoon trades on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), AMD stock rose 1.3% to 91.08. During a recent pullback, it returned to the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) of its recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/).


On March 15, AMD stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 89.04, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. It climbed as high as 102.43 on March 23 before retreating.


In a positive sign, AMD stock found support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). It is now bouncing off that key support level.


AMD Earnings Report Due
-----------------------


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company plans to report first-quarter results on May 2 after the market close.


Analysts polled by FactSet expect AMD to earn 56 cents a share on sales of $5.31 billion in the March quarter. That would translate toÂ year-over-year declines in earnings and sales of 50% and 16%, respectively.


When AMD reported [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-chipmaker-beats-q4-targets/) on Jan. 31, the company predicted that the PC market would bottom in the first quarter. Demand for personal computers dried up after consumers and businesses binged on new PCs during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.


In recent quarters, AMD's sales have been buoyed by robust demand for data-center processors.


Analysts Forecast Better Times Ahead
------------------------------------


BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya rates AMD stock as buy with a price target of 98. He is positive on AMD because of its product roadmap this year and its exposure to cloud-computing providers who are spending heavily on artificial-intelligence projects.


"AMD is overall better positioned (than rival **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC))) given its high exposure to cloud vendors who should ramp up CPU (central processing unit) and accelerator investments on AI tailwind," he said in a recent note to clients.


TD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay sees "muted" first-half 2023 results for AMD followed by a second-half rebound and a stronger 2024 and 2025. He rates AMD stock as outperform with a price target of 120.


"Near term, we continue to see a choppy first-half 2023 giving way to strong momentum in second-half 2023, with further acceleration to carry into a stronger 2024/25 as macro, cloud capex, and enterprise spending recover," Ramsay said in a recent note.

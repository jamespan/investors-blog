Website developer and [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Friday.




The company offers a cloud-based website development platform, enabling businesses and organizations, artists, and individuals to take their businesses, brands and workflow online.


Founded in 2006, Wix had 142 million registered users worldwide at the end of 2018, up 19% from the previous year. Four million of those are paid subscribers, up 24%, with the rest using its free services. More than half its customers are in the U.S.


Israel-based Wix, a rival of **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)), recently expanded its product offerings, rolling out its new Ascend-branded marketing tools aimed at small businesses. Ascend is a suite of 20 products.

Biggest Stock Market Winners
----------------------------


Wix, in its cup-with-handle breakout, moved above its buy point of 123.34. The [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) is one of the bullish chart patterns that the biggest stock market winners form at the start of their rallies. Wix stock rose 2.8%, closing at 125.02 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Volume started off strong but was fading, up just 7% vs. the 40% you ideally want to see.


The company has posted double-digit revenue growth per quarter going back more than four years. For its fourth quarter, Wix reported revenue of $164.2 million, up 39% from the year-ago period. It posted adjusted earnings of 42 cents per share, up 162%.


Revenue for the full year 2018 was $603.7 million, up 42%


While fourth-quarter revenue and earnings beat estimates [Wix stock plunged](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wix-earnings-wix-stock-q4-2018/) on Feb. 20 as first-quarter and 2019 guidance was weaker than expected. Though Wix profits are expected to slow a bit this year, 2020 earnings look good.


Institutional investor action is also good. Fidelity Contrafund recently reopened a position. T. Rowe Price has been a steady investor.


Wix has a healthy [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94, meaning the stock currently tops 94% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.


A Weakness In Wix Stock
-----------------------


One weak spot is the company's EPS Rating of 75, which tracks quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth. Look for that to improve to 80 or better to show it's in the top 20% of all stocks.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/rs-line-is-a-must-tool-for-complete-investor/) is not at a peak but it's close. The RS line on [IBD stock charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), shows how a stock is doing in relation to the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance. A declining line confirms a lagging performance.


Wix holds the No. 16 rank among about 60 companies in the IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) are currently the top-rated stocks within the group.


Wix said it put out more products in 2018 than ever before.


"Our 2019 outlook reflects continued growth from existing and new products as we plan to make additional investments this year to bring new products to market and expand into new markets," said Lior Shemesh, chief financial officer, in prepared remarks with the company's fourth-quarter earnings report.


Additional Investments Planned
------------------------------


Wix plans to make some additional investments in 2019 including increasing advertising activities, building an account sales team targeting agencies, and increasing customer support head count to drive growth in subscription conversion and monetization.


Jefferies analyst Brent Thill has a buy rating on Wix stock and a price target of 145. That's about 66% above where Wix stock currently trades.


"Wix remains a premium small-cap story providing investors some of the best growth in our coverage while still trading in line with peer averages," Thill said in a note to clients this week. "We see plenty of room for upside to current estimates."

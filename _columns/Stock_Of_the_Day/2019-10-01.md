Premium furniture chain **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). RH stock is closing in on a buy point after a big post-earnings jump.




[RH's second-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-stock-buy-zone-rh-earnings-q2-2019/), reported after the close on Sept. 10, topped expectations. The chain also nudged its full-year sales forecast higher and raised its profit outlook. Shares sprinted 5% higher the following day, uppercutting through a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 149.86 entry.


RH Stock, Williams-Sonoma Stock
-------------------------------


But in the days since the trading of RH stock, which tends to flail wildly after earnings, has been rangebound. On Tuesday, that trading trajectory qualified as a so-called [three-weeks-tight pattern,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) presenting another possible buying opportunity with an entry point of 175.39.


Shares closed down 0.2% at 170.55 on the [stock market today.](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) Normally, IBD advises investors with existing positions in a stock to consider buying off a three-weeks-tight pattern. But because RH stock is still relatively near its earlier 149.86 entry, new investors could take a position in the stock as well.


RH stock also has a high-growth, low price-to-earnings ratio, a pairing increasingly favored by the market, as well as a best-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measures RH's ability to grow profits, is also strong, at 97. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which rises the more a stock outpaces the S&P 500, is near the record highs it reached last year. IBD encourages investors to focus on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s.


Meanwhile, rival **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) is also nearing its own buy point. On Tuesday, shares slipped 0.25% to 67.81, working on a cup-with-handle buy point of 70.68.

Avoiding Trade War, Embracing Traditional Retail
------------------------------------------------


As other retailers try to figure out how to operate in the digital world carved out by **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), RH has doubled down on refined physical retail spaces — sometimes with their own restaurants — and thick print catalogs more common in decades past. RH had 85 stores at the end of the second quarter.


The furniture retailer in recent years has also fattened profits through an annual membership program that offers discounts. RH CEO Gary Friedman has said the company has remained "cautiously optimistic" about the second half of this year, hoping for a rebound from last year's higher interest rates, market volatility and a high-end housing market he characterized as "depressed."


However, RH got around 41% of its products from China during the last fiscal year, based on total dollar volume of purchases. The high concentration of sourcing from China makes RH stock vulnerable to the U.S.-China trade war. Management has said it would raise some prices and move production out of China as a result.

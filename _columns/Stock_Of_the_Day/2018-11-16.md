Like other medical-research players, PRA Health stock is benefiting from its ties to [Big Pharma and biotech](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/).

Bullish View On Organic Growth
------------------------------


Kreger calls for a growth speed bump in the third quarter to ameliorate in 2019. During the quarter, organic growth slowed to 8.2% from 11.7% in the prior quarter. That was also below his estimate for 10.8% organic growth.


"We believe this is likely due to a slower ramp-up of studies that clients reprioritized earlier in the year," he said in a recent note to clients. "We view this as only a temporary step-down, and believe that double-digit organic growth in 2019 is likely."


PRA Health maintained its view for 10%-12% organic growth for the full year. That implies 10% growth in the fourth quarter, Kreger said. The firm kept its 2018 sales prediction for $2.87 billion to $2.92 billion, and raised its adjusted profit view to $4.22-$4.27 a share.


Kreger reiterated his outperform rating on PRA Health stock.


"Overall, we believe the business is performing well, and we are encouraged by continued robust new awards," he said.


Double-Digit Sales, Earnings Growth
-----------------------------------


On a reported basis, PRA Health's quarterly sales have grown by a double-digit percentage for the past 12 consecutive quarters. The medical-research player also has several years of double-digit growth in quarterly profit under its belt.


To that point, third-quarter earnings jumped 28% to $1.13 per share, excluding certain items. That topped Kreger's view for $1.11 and analyst predictions for $1.07. That also beat the view of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Sandy Draper for $1.05.


Draper raised her price target on PRA Health stock to 120 from 110 in a recent note. She has a buy rating on PRA Health stock.


Highly Rated Medical-Research Stock
-----------------------------------

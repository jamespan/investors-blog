Cybersecurity firm **CrowdStrike Holdings** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) ahead of its earnings report due on Sept. 2. CrowdStrike stock has formed a double-bottom base chart pattern, giving the cybersecurity firm a new entry point.




Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike uses machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, and a specialized database to detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks. Many cybersecurity firms are turning to  [AI software to improve products](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).


Demand for endpoint security has increased amid the corporate shift to remote work. Analysts say CrowdStrike has been gaining share from legacy security providers, such as **Broadcom**'s ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) Symantec unit and McAfee.


CrowdStrike stock has forged a new [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 116.28 owing to the [double-bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). That pattern is an alternative interpretation of a seven-week consolidation with a buy point of 118.68, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).

From a technical view, the double-bottom pattern looks sort of like the letter "W." It features two distinct sell-offs and often sets the stage for a new breakout.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), CrowdStrike stock rose 3.1% to 117.11. Earlier in the session, it notched a record high of 119.94.


CrowdStrike Stock: July-Quarter Earnings Due
--------------------------------------------


The cybersecurity firm holds an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94 out of a possible 99. That means it has outperformed 94% of stocks over the past 12 months.


Meanwhile, CrowdStrike's second-quarter earnings are due Sept. 2. Analysts expect the cybersecurity firm to report a 1-cent per-share loss vs. an 18-cent loss a year earlier.


CrowdStrike's revenue is seen jumping nearly 82% to $188.5 million, based on analyst estimates.


With CrowdStrike earnings due soon, investors may want to be cautious. One trading strategy for investors heading into company earnings reports is using [call options](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/stock-market-strategies-using-options-around-earnings-helps-minimize-risk/).


CrowdStrike IPO Raised $659 Million
-----------------------------------


The CrowdStrike initial public offering in June 2019 raised $659 million with shares priced at 34. CrowdStrike stock has jumped about 138% this year amid the coronavirus pandemic as companies instruct many employees to work from home.


Older antivirus software looks for "signatures" of known malicious software. More advanced machine learning tools learn to identify malware traits rather than specific signatures. That enables them to detect new types of malware.


To process malware scans, CrowdStrike rents computing resources worldwide from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) unit Amazon Web Services, the biggest cloud computing service provider.


UBS analyst Fatima Boolani initiated coverage of CrowdStrike stock with a buy rating on Aug. 14.


"Endpoint security is a large, established category constituting over 10% of the overall $60 billion market for commercial cybersecurity software," Boolani said in a report. "This category has witnessed a spending renaissance in the last three years, owing to broader trends like cloud adoption and migration, device growth, and work-from-home that have metastasized and complexified the corporate cyberattack surface."



CrowdStrike Taking Share From Symantec, McAfee
----------------------------------------------


The UBS analyst added: "CRWD's behavioral-based detection mechanisms are much more efficient at watching for strange traffic behavior than the alternative of watching for every version of malware — an important distinction because hackers rarely rewrite attack programs."


In addition, research firm Gartner estimated that CrowdStrike had just over 6% of the endpoint market in 2019. McAfee and Symantec both had over 9%.


CrowdStrike stock, meanwhile, has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


CrowdStrike stock carries an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94 out of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group.

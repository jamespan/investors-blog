Lodging company **Target Hospitality** ([TH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TH)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, as the stock is finding support following its early-July breakout and a major gap-up.




Texas-based Target Hospitality operates hotels and temporary housing units for company workforces and government initiatives, as well as providing hospitality, maintenance, janitorial and food services. Its lodging network consists of 1,600 modular housing units for oil, gas and mining operations.


In total, it has more than 16,000 rooms across 31 sites in Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico and Texas. And its government services segment, which makes up a bulk of the company's revenue, offers hospitality services to support domestic humanitarian aid efforts.


Target Hospitality has beaten analyst estimates for nine straight quarters. For its second quarter, Target Hospitality posted record quarterly revenue of $110 million, up 46% from the year-ago quarter. And it reported earnings of 27 cents per share, up sharply from 2 cents a year ago.


Government Contracts
--------------------


In July, Target Hospitality announced it enhanced its lease and services agreement for its Expanded Humanitarian Contract, as part of the government's effort to support displaced persons. The expanded contract includes amenities, services and infrastructure solutions for roughly 6,400 people, representing a 60% population increase from the initial contract.


The recurring lease and infrastructure enhancement revenue will generate a minimum of $390 million for Target Hospitality annually. Along with the services revenue component, the contract could provide a maximum of $575 million in annual value. Roughly 73% of Target Hospitality's 2022 revenue will come from its government contracts.


Following the expanded contract, Target Hospitality boosted its full-year revenue outlook by 53%, bringing it to a record range of $500 million to $510 million.


Among traditional lodging firms, **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) and **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) are both gradually improving. But it's a tough market as the travel industry returns to normalcy following the coronavirus pandemic.


Hyatt Hotels posted positive earnings of 46 cents per share for its quarter ending in June. Its quarterly losses have slowed, and the company is posting positive sales growth. Airbnb is rounding the corner, reporting positive earnings in three of the last four quarters.

Brooks Automation Stock A Play On Chips, Life Sciences
------------------------------------------------------


Brooks makes life science and semiconductor manufacturing automation systems. It provides precision robotics, integrated automation systems and services for the semiconductor industry. It also serves the life sciences industry with automation and cryogenics systems used in drug development and advanced cell therapies. Brooks recently added capability for gene sequencing and gene synthesis services through its strategic acquisition of Genewiz.


On July 1, Brooks completed the [sale of its semiconductor cryogenics business](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brooks-finalizes-divestiture-of-semiconductor-cryogenics-business-to-atlas-copco-300878547.html) to Edwards Vacuum for $675 million in cash.


Earnings Seen Falling For Fourth Straight Quarter Ahead Of Rebound
------------------------------------------------------------------


On Aug. 1, Brooks plans to report results for its fiscal third quarter, which ended June 30. Analysts expect the company to earn 16 cents a share on sales of $205 million. That would translate to year-over-year declines of 65% in earnings and 8% in sales. Like other chip gear suppliers, Brooks is dealing with a cyclical downturn in demand.


If Brooks meets expectations, sales and earnings will have fallen for four straight quarters. Wall Street expects revenue and profit to increase again for Brooks starting in the September quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research. Estimates predict a near-doubling of earnings in the 2020 fiscal year.


Semiconductor Stocks Surge On Earnings News
-------------------------------------------


Chip stocks rallied on Wednesday after positive earnings reports from **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)), Teradyne and **Silicon Laboratories** ([SLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLAB)). TI stock rose 7.4%. Teradyne rocketed 20.5%. Silicon Labs increased 6.5%.


The **VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF** ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) climbed 2.7% on Wednesday. The chip ETF was the IBD Stock Of The Day on [Monday](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chip-stocks-in-buy-range-smh-etf-amd-stock-intel-stock-micron-stock/).

**Popular** ([BPOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BPOP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The holding company for Puerto Rico-based Popular Bank (Banco Popular in Puerto Rico) is closing in on a buy zone after reporting huge earnings growth.




Popular stock is rising after the bank topped analyst views on both earnings and revenue last week. Bank stocks overall are rallying thanks to rising interest rates and a new stock market rally attempt.


IBD Stock Of The Day Closes In On Buy Point
-------------------------------------------


Shares rose 1.5% to finish at 52.01 in Wednesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), after hitting a nine-year high of 53.02 intraday. Popular stock has a 53.10 buy point from a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). This particular pattern is also intriguing to [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) connoisseurs, especially amid a stock market correction.



A flat base reflects unusual strength. Instead of selling off in a down market, a stock forming a flat base is holding steady. This action tells you the stock wants to run higher.


Popular's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been hitting its best levels since January 2017, another bullish sign.


However, the stock market correction isn't over. Until a follow-through day confirms a new rally, investors should be wary of making any purchases.

Popular Earnings Growth Accelerates
-----------------------------------


Popular earnings growth has accelerated for the past two quarters, including a huge 626% year-over-year gain in the third quarter. That huge gain was helped by easy year-over-year comparisons as Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017.


While revenue has not accelerated, it has grown at a double-digit rate for the last two quarters.


Popular stock is ranked second in the [Banks-Southeast industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-30-2018/). It boasts an impressive, but not quite ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 93.


Popular stock has enjoyed a stellar 2018 so far. Its price has surged 49% so far this year, and it has built four bases within that time.


Banking stocks got more good news Wednesday as Federal Reserve governors proposed softer regulatory oversight for smaller banks. The plan would dial back rules for U.S. banks considered unlikely to pose a threat to the financial system. The move is intended to limit the toughest demands only to the largest lenders.

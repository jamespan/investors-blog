The [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) is **LHC Group** ([LHCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHCG)), a leading provider of home health care and hospice services that is enjoying rapid growth via consolidation and a joint venture. LHC Group stock overcame a weak day for the overall [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) to near a buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/).




LHC merged with Almost Family in an $800 million stock deal that closed last April. In 2017, it established a venture with hospital operator LifePoint Health to share ownership of home health and hospice providers across LifePoint's footprint.


In the third quarter, LHC saw revenue grow 88% from a year ago to $507 million, after soaring 95% in the second quarter. Overall home health revenue grew 83%, while organic home health revenue grew 9%.


Home health is a key area of growth for an industry that is looking to keep a lid on costs by providing care in the lowest-cost appropriate location.


LHC said in its third-quarter earnings statement that its "unique positioning is enhanced by a growing number of hospitals and health systems that recognize the inherent value of our business model and our ability to create high-performing post-acute networks for them."


Based in Lafayette, La., LHC has 32,000 employees providing home health, hospice and other services in 780 locations in 36 states.


LHC Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------


LHC stock rose 0.5% to 103.73 on Tuesday after climbing as high as 107.11 intraday. It has a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 107.61. LHC stock is currently in a [cup-without-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) base, but could be forming a handle just below the left side of the consolidation, which would give it a slightly lower entry point. A proper handle must be flat to downward sloping and at least five sessions long.

Rio Tinto stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the mining giant's shares break out of a base on rising metal prices, which are lifting other miners too.




The gains for the company and other mining stocks came as mining stocks rallied on Wednesday, as the price of copper, which **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) also mines, [regained the $10,000-per-tonne](https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-stocks-idUSL4N2MS1B2) level. Prices topped that milestone last week for the first time in 10 years.


On a per-pound basis, copper prices rose 0.1% to $4.53 Wednesday, nearly matching the decade high of $4.54 reached last week.


Mining stocks and metal prices have broadly been lifted by the economic rebound, which has created more demand for iron ore, copper and other metals that get used in other materials and devices. A potential infrastructure push from President Joe Biden has also lifted the sector.


For infrastructure, iron ore is a key ingredient in steel, potentially bolstering Rio Tinto stock and others that mine the substance. Copper, used by electric vehicles and wind and solar energy systems, could play a bigger role in any infrastructure plans that lean green.

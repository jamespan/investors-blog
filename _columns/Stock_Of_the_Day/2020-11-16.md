**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm on Monday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates amid an acquisition spree. PANW stock climbed into a buy zone as the cybersecurity firm raised January-quarter and full-year guidance.




The cybersecurity stock headed into the earnings report with an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 260.25. A 5% [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) extends to 273.26. Shares jumped 7.7% to close at 278.50 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Palo Alto stock owns an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of only 51 out of a possible 99. However, PANW stock has formed a bullish [double-bottom chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The double bottom looks sort of like the letter "W." It often sets the stage for a rally.


Founded in 2005, Palo Alto launched its initial public offering in 2012. The cybersecurity stock initially underperformed.

New CEO Makes Acquisitions
--------------------------


But Palo Alto stock boomed in 2014 and 2015 as it took share in the computer network "firewall" market vs.Â  **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and others.


Firewall appliances protect computer networks by blocking online intrusions and monitoring web-based apps. However, as corporate America shifts to off-premises cloud-computing services, sales growth has slowed for network firewall appliance makers.


In June 2018, Palo Alto brought in a new chief executive to make strategic changes. The new CEO, Nikesh Arora, was a former top executive at **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google and SoftBank Group. Arora embarked on an acquisition spree to build a broad, cloud-based platform branded "Prisma."


On Nov. 11, Palo Alto made its biggest purchase under Arora. It bought Expanse, a specialist in computer security vulnerability management, in a deal valued at $800 million.


Palo Alto Earnings Beat Expectations
------------------------------------


Palo Alto purchased startup CloudGenix for $420 million in cash earlier this year. It also bought the Crypsis Group, an incident response, risk management and digital forensics consulting firm, for $265 million in cash. In all, Palo Alto has spent over $2.4 billion on acquisitions since Arora took the helm.


While much of the old Palo Alto management team has departed, Arora brought in another Google veteran, Amit Singh, as president. Singh founded Google's cloud-computing business.


Palo Alto, meanwhile, has shifted much of its cloud platform to Google infrastructure. The close ties have led to speculation that Google could acquire Palo Alto.


Palo Alto earnings for the October quarter came in at $1.62 a share, up 54% from the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 23% to $946 million, the company said. Billings increased 21% to $1.1 billion vs. estimates of $1.04 billion.


Analysts expected Palo Alto earnings of $1.33 a share on sales of $921.6 million for the period ended Oct. 30. A year earlier, Palo Alto earnings were $1.05 a share on sales of $771.9 million.


Palo Alto Guidance Above Views
------------------------------


For the current quarter ending in January, Palo Alto expects earnings of $1.43, with revenue in a range of $975 million to $990 million. Analysts had estimated earnings of $1.35 a share on revenue of $971 million.


For fiscal 2021, Palo Alto raised its earnings outlook to a range of $5.70 to $5.80 a share vs. estimates of $5.60 a share. Palo Alto said it expects revenue in a range of $4.09 billion to $4.14 billion vs. estimates of $4.02 billion.


Also, the cybersecurity firm forecast full-year billings, a sales growth metric, in a range of $5.08 billion to $5.13 billion vs. estimates of $4.95 billion.


PANW stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.

**GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the contract chipmaker surges higher after an upbeat third-quarter earnings report. GFS stock is approaching a formal buy point.




Early Tuesday, GlobalFoundries beat Wall Street's targets for the third quarter and guided much higher for profits in the current period.


The Malta, N.Y.-based company earned an adjusted 67 cents a share on sales of $2.07 billion in the September quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expected GlobalFoundries earnings of 62 cents a share on sales of $2.05 billion. In the year-earlier period, GlobalFoundries earned 7 cents a share on sales of $1.7 billion.


For the current quarter, GlobalFoundries now forecasts adjusted earnings of $1.34 a share on sales of $2.08 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its outlook. Wall Street had predicted earnings of $1.05 a share on sales of $2.086 billion in the fourth quarter.

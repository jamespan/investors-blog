As [Hurricane Florence heads for the East Coast](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/09/09/florence-strengthens-to-hurricane-and-poses-extreme-threat-to-southeast-and-mid-atlantic/?utm_term=.fb07afe7dd74), residents are stocking up, lifting three hurricane plays. Generator maker **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), breaking out of a bullish pattern in huge volume Monday. Home improvement chains **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) are hitting record highs, with Home Depot stock still in buy range.




"Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Florence is forecast to become a major hurricane this morning, and is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday," cautioned the [National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT1+shtml/100853.shtml) on Monday. Winds have reached speeds of 105 mph, and the swells will likely create "life-threatening" surf conditions, the agency said.


The governors of Virginia, North and South Carolina have declared states of emergency. [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-florence-latest-path-forecast-landfall-from-carolinas-north-live-updates-2018-09-10/) reported that some store shelves have been emptied out as people stock up on supplies, including generators, water and plywood.


Generac Stock Generates Breakout
--------------------------------


Amid the preparation, shares of generator manufacturer **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) are rising sharply in Monday's stock market trading. Investors often eye home-improvement stocks and generator stocks as possible beneficiaries of such natural disasters. (Though as CNBC has pointed out, that is [not at all a sure thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/28/dont-expect-easy-money-from-hurricanes.html).)

Generac could get a big sales bump this week, with additional sales later to people without power or those who simply want to be prepared for the next big storm.


One Lowe's in Raleigh, North Carolina, [reportedly sold 100 generators in half a day](https://www.wjhl.com/top-news/regional/raleigh-nc-store-sells-100-generators-in-a-half-day-as-hurricane-florence-lurks-offshore/1430209370) over the weekend.

Generac stock shot up 5.6% to 58.83 in very heavy volume. Shares broke out past a 56.74 buy point from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) within a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). Generac stock is nearing its all-time high of 62.50 from early 2014.


Generac Earnings Growth Strong
------------------------------


Over the past year Generac earnings growth has revived, with double-digit gains in the past four quarters. That includes a 63% EPS gain in the latest quarter and 90% Generac earnings growth in the quarter before that.


Meanwhile, Generac's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is hitting new highs.


Generac in June closed the acquisition of Selmec Equipos Industriales, an industrial generator designer and manufacturer.


Home Depot, Lowe's Stocks Also Rise
-----------------------------------


also climbing Monday, both reaching new peaks.

Home Depot stock rose 2.2% to 210.69, hitting a new high but still in buy range after clearing a 204.35 flat-base entry point. Home Depot stock was rising in strong volume.


Volume was 27% above normal in the Sept. 4 breakout. That's OK, but investors should look for stocks clearing buy points in volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal.


Lowe's stock is also trading higher in heavy volume Monday, rising 2.6% to 112.40, a new high. Shares are extended from a 101.43 buy point in late August from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/).


Grocery stores in affected areas are also likely seeing higher foot traffic, as residents stock up on food and water.

[Twilio stock](https://www.investors.com/research/twlo-stock-buy-now/) is finding key support as it continues building a flat base despite downward pressure among software issues, and thus earns a spot as the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) shares were down nearly 6% in above-average volume in early afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) amid weakness in the overall software sector. But they improved from early morning action and continue to hold above the 50-day moving average. Twilio kicked off its current [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), which bears a 151.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), on June 20.


Twilio stock last cleared a 136.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a flat base in late April, triggered the [7%-8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) two weeks later, and quickly recrossed the entry. Another pullback and recovery followed before Twilio started forming the current base. The stock has routinely tested its 50-day line this year en route to a 57% gain.


The San Francisco-based company provides cloud communications software that enables businesses to engage with their customers. Earlier this month, Twilio added automation and email testing features to help businesses optimize their email campaigns.

CLOSE




Twilio in October paid $2 billion to acquire SendGrid, which operates a cloud-based email marketing platform. Twilio's core product is a software platform that allows app developers to embed voice, text messaging and video into their products.


Twilio Earnings Due This Week
-----------------------------


The San Francisco-based cloud communications software provider reports second-quarter results Wednesday after the close. Analysts expect earnings to stay flat at 3 cents a share on 79% higher sales.


That would extend its profit streak to a fifth straight quarter. Sales have held in the double digits for more than the past four years. Twilio turned its first annual profit last year, at 11 cents a share. Wall Street forecasts a 9% increase this year to 12 cents, then a 142% jump to 29 cents in 2020.


Investors should be wary of buying a stock ahead of earnings. You never know how a stock will react or what surprises a company's report will yield. For instance, despite an earnings and revenue beat in the first quarter — as well as higher full-year guidance — [Twilio shares lost more than 6%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twilio-earnings-twlo-stock-sendgrid-guidance/)after the April 30 earnings report.


Mutual Funds Like Twilio Stock
------------------------------


IBD Stock Checkup assigns Twilio a 98 Composite Rating, which combines key fundamental and technical ratings into a single score. That puts it among the leaders in the 66-stock enterprise software industry group. The group includes **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), a Sector Leader and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock. [Sector Leaders](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/sectorleaders) **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) and **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) also are in the group.


Twilio's 76 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) could use a little improvement. But keep in mind that 2018 marked its first profitable year, and the company is expected to grow earnings this year and next. A 98 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) means Twilio is beating 98% of all other stocks.


Its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates more recent net buying than selling by mutual funds. At least two highly regarded funds, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), held shares in the second quarter. And the number of mutual fund shareholders has steadily increased in the past three quarters, from 444 in the third quarter last year to 744 in the second quarter.

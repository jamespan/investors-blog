**L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the defense stock gaps up closer to a buy point amid increasing tensions in the Middle East.




Defense stocks got a broad boost Friday following the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran's most powerful military commander, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who headed Iran's elite Quds Force. The move has raised the risk of serious escalation with Tehran.


Soleimani had spearheaded the theocratic state's bolstering of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the expansion of its military presence in Iraq and Syria and helped lead Syria's offensive against rebel groups in the country's long civil war.


[It emerged Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/us-to-deploy-more-troops-to-the-middle-east-after-iranian-gen-soleimani-killed.html) that about 3,500 additional American soldiers are being sent to the Middle East following the killing. They are being deployed to Iraq, Kuwait and other parts of the region. Their role is to serve as a response to threats in the region following Soleimani's death.

Stock Of The Day Makes These Key Systems
----------------------------------------


L3Harris is the result of last year's merger between Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies. The firm is expected to come up with $18 billion in annualized revenues when its integration is complete.


The company makes battlefield communications systems, night-vision devices, sensors and satellite communications. It also makes a computer processor for **Lockheed Martin**'s ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) F-35 stealth fighter.


Defense stocks overall had a strong 2019 as the Trump administration looks to invest heavily in new U.S. capabilities while the expanding Pentagon budget enjoys rare bipartisan support in Congress.


Defense Stock L3Harris Pops
---------------------------


Shares closed up 3.5% at 210.47 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), trying to break out from a 15-week flat base with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 217.41, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The defense stock retook its 50-day moving average Thursday and decisively gapped above it Friday.


But the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which compares a stock's performance to the broader S&P 500 index, remains well below recent highs. While it made progress overall in 2019, it started to decline from mid-August but ticked upward a bit at the end of December.



L3 Harris stock has an [IBD Composite Rating of 95](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), which puts it in the top 5% of names tracked. The [Stock Checkup Tool shows earnings growth](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-l3harris-technologies-lhx.aspx) has been strong, swelling by an average 31% over the past three quarters. However, it slowed to 26% growth in the most recent quarter.


In late October, the company reported [mixed quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/mercury-systems-earnings-l3harris-earnings-defense-stocks/), beating earnings estimates, but missing slightly on revenue. But L3Harris also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $10 from a prior target of $9.60-$9.70, and analysts see strong growth ahead, with EPS seen popping 34% in 2020 and 15% in 2021.


The [CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) call for growth of 25% or more over that time period. Growth has not been as strong over the longer term, averaging 21% over the past three years.

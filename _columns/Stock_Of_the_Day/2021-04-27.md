**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after blowing away first-quarter estimates Tuesday with soaring profits and giving strong sales guidance. Crocs stock jumped into buy range.




The shoemaker has seen its popularity soar during the Covid-19 pandemic as Americans shed their work attire for a more comfortable wardrobe.


Its foamy rubber clogs have a cultlike following on the Gen Z-focused TikTok social media app. Fans were eager to grab co-branded Justin Bieber and Latin Pop star Bad Bunny clogs with the shoes selling out in just over an hour.


Crocs also has collaboration deals with rapper Post Malone and country singer Luke Combs.


Early Tuesday, Crocs reported adjusted earnings shot up 577% to $1.49 per share, crushing estimates for 88 cents. Revenue surged 64% to $460.1 million, also beating estimates for $415.4 million. Digital sales jumped 75.3% as customers turned to online shopping during the pandemic.


Looking ahead, Crocs sees Q2 sales growing 60%-70% year over year, well above the 40% growth rate analysts forecast. It also sees 2021 sales growing 40%-50%, nearly double views for 24.6%.

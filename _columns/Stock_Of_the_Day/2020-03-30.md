**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the graphics-chip maker is showing strong relative strength during the coronavirus-fueled market downturn. Wall Street analysts see Nvidia stock as a likely leader after the market recovers.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Nvidia stock rose 5.1% to 265.59. Last week, it rose above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), an upbeat indicator. It appears to be forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


But buying stocks is highly discouraged during a market correction. Investors should wait for a confirmed uptrend. Check out [IBD's Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) for the current market direction.


Market downturns are a good time to assemble [watchlists of quality stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-prepare-watch-list-new-leaders/). Stocks holding up well during a tough market often outperform once the market goes back to a confirmed uptrend.

Nvidia Stock Upgraded To Buy
----------------------------


On Friday, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino upgraded Nvidia stock to buy from hold. He kept his 12-month price target at 300.


"While we acknowledge near-term uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, we expect Nvidia's data center business to be more resilient than most end markets, reflecting a resurgence of orders from cloud customers and momentum for Nvidia's (artificial intelligence) inferencing capabilities," he said in a note to clients.


Also, sales of Nvidia graphics chips for video games should pick up later this year, Zino said.


Plus, Nvidia's pending purchase of **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) should provide an additional catalyst for the company, he said. Mellanox makes high-speed networking products for data centers. Nvidia expects to close that [$6.9 billion acquisition](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion) in the coming weeks.


Nvidia stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 97% of stocks over the past 12 months. Plus, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is in record high territory as it outpaces the broader market.



Called 'Desert Island' Stock Pick
---------------------------------


Nvidia stock has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-corp-nvda.aspx) tool. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Semiconductor stocks have been top performers lately. The [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top growth stocks includes seven semiconductor industry players. Nvidia stock ranks No. 5 on the list.


Nvidia makes graphics processing units, which have applications in data centers, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. Its GPUs also are providing [critical processing power for researchers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-shows-resilience-coronavirus-market-correction/) seeking solutions to the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said in a report last week.


Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said Nvidia stock is one of his "desert island picks" during the Covid-19 coronavirus crisis.


He is upbeat on the company's prospects because of strong data center demand, upcoming 7-nanometer products, and its "long-term sustainable advantage in AI," he said in a note to clients last week. Caso rates Nvidia stock as outperform.

Google stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares of parent company **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) approach multiple buy points.




The search engine powerhouse is benefiting from increased adoption of digital advertising and online shopping amid the pandemic, Phillip Capital analyst Jonathan Woo said in a December report. He also noted the "blistering 110% spike in earnings this year," and called for 20% growth in 2022.


Alongside that, Google is making strides in commercializing YouTube with digital ads and monetary incentives for content creators, Woo said. He also noted the cloud business is expected to outgrow the company's 21% compounded annual growth rate based on its "aggressive" go-to-market strategy.


He initiated coverage of [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) with an accumulate recommendation and a price target of 3,380.

Google Stock: Multiple Entries
------------------------------


In midday trading on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Google stock rose 2.9% near 2945.39.


Shares are eyeing multiple possible entries. According to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), Google stock is above its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 2,925.17 out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). On the daily chart, a bounce off the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) — which occurred Tuesday — could also be actionable for a [Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen).


But investors could also look at a [four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) entry at 3,019.43 on the weekly chart. Shares could also just be weeks away from forming a new base.


Google stock was added to Investor's Business Daily's [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


Outperforming Other FANG Stocks
-------------------------------


On a year-to-date basis, Google stock has rocketed nearly 68%. That has helped it outperform fellow FANG stocks [**Meta Platforms**](https://www.investors.com/research/fb-stock-buy-now-facebook-stock/) ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) (formerly Facebook), [**Amazon.com**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-buy-now/) ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and [**Netflix**](https://www.investors.com/research/netflix-stock-buy-now/) ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


In the current quarter, analysts expect Google to earn $27.45 a share, minus some items, on $72.02 billion in sales. Earnings would soar more than 23% as sales pop nearly 27%. Both measures would be in line with [CAN SLIM advice](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), which suggests investors seek companies with at least 20%-25% recent [earnings and sales growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/in-can-slim-quarterly-earnings-are-most-important/).


Phillip Capital's Woo notes Google has a monopoly of search engine traffic at 92% share. But strength will come from advertising tied to that.


"Macro shifts in trends towards more digital forms of advertising, as well as an increasing amount of digital transformation projects globally should provide tailwinds to support (adjusted profit) growth," he said.


YouTube Helps Ad Growth
-----------------------


YouTube fits into that strategy as Google's fastest growth product. Revenue from the video service has more than doubled over the last three years to $20 billion, accounting for 12% of total revenue, Woo said. YouTube now counts more than 2 million content creators, 2 billion monthly users and more than 2 billion hours of video watched daily.


"We expect YouTube revenue to continue growing at this rate and hit $36 billion by 2022, led by strength in its advertising reach and effectiveness, and supported by increases in consumer preference for short-form and on-demand video," he said.


Helping support this is a robust cloud business, Google stock analyst Woo said.


The cloud business has grown at an annual compounded rate of 48% over the past three years. Cloud sales were $13 billion in 2020.


"We expect this segment to continue its strong growth pattern and double revenue by end of 2022, as the company rides tailwinds from early-stage growth in the overall cloud industry," he said.


Google Stock Is Highly Rated
----------------------------


Bullishly, Google stock ranks highly across [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital) ratings. Shares have a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. This puts Google stock in the leading 4% of all stocks in terms of technical and fundamental measures.


Shares also have a nearly perfect [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 98, putting Alphabet's earnings growth in the top 2% of all stocks regardless of industry group. Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 puts Google stock's 12-month performance in the top 9% of all stocks.

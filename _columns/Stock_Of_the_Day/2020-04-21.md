**Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as Big Pharma's drugmaking partner stays resilient amid the coronavirus pandemic. Repligen stock is now approaching a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




Shares of Repligen crashed to a five-month low on March 23 alongside a broader Street skid on worries a [coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) slowdown would rout the economy. The economic concerns are undeniable. However, Repligen stock has ramped up nearly 33% in the aftermath, slightly outperforming even a bullish 30% gain for its medical products peers.


Janney analyst Paul Knight expects the company to be "recession-resistant." Repligen provides the tools necessary for [biotech and pharmaceutical companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) to make drugs.


"As a world leader in purification, filtration and process monitoring of biotechnology production, Repligen represents a prime recession-resistant tool stock," Knight said in a report to clients. The analyst has a buy rating and 119 price target on Repligen stock.

Repligen Stock Is Nearing A Breakout
------------------------------------


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Repligen [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) inched up to 104.23 in low volume. Shares are nearing a buy point of 110.04 out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). The stock is also well above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/).


Repligen sells protein and filtration products, and tools for chromatography, a process of separating a mixture. All are necessary to create medicine.


Many biotech and pharma companies have temporarily delayed clinical tests amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This will undoubtedly impact Repligen stock. But some 30% of the company's sales are tied to already approved therapies, Janney's Knight estimates.


Meanwhile, about 70% of Repligen's revenue stems from clinical research customers, he says. Knight noted around three dozen biotech and pharma companies announced delays in new patient screening, recruitment and enrolling for clinical studies due to the pandemic.


"We view any disruption is likely short-term and does not change the long-term outlook as biopharma will quickly ramp clinical (study) activity post-crisis," he said.


Representatives of Repligen didn't immediately return a request for comment.


Coronavirus Pandemic Could Slow Orders
--------------------------------------


SVB Leerink analyst Puneet Souda is also bullish on Repligen stock amid the pandemic. He sees midteens organic revenue growth long-term and a potential for $400 million to $500 million in sales by 2023, up from just $270 million in 2019.


In a report issued to clients, Souda quotes Repligen Chief Executive Tony Hunt saying commercial and clinical-stage customers are doing their best to "stay open."


Although much of North America and Europe remains subject to stay-at-home orders, Repligen has seen countries in the Asia-Pacific region emerge from the pandemic and become "more active" in recent weeks, Souda said in his note.


It's important to note, this region only accounts for 12% of Repligen's sales.



Also, Repligen is on deck to launch several key products in the latter half of 2020, Souda says. Further, the medical company is likely to be at the forefront in processing cell and [gene therapy products](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/gene-therapy-blazes-amid-fda-approvals-pharmaceutical-companies-getting-hungry/).


"Repligen is helping manufacturers in the regenerative medicine space be more efficient and improve manufacturing yields — two major bottlenecks," he said. "Customers are flocking to their prepacked chromatography columns and filtration products."


Sales of products to cell and gene therapy customers accounted for 15% of Repligen sales in 2019. But that segment doubled year over year and is expected to grow 30% in 2020. Souda has an outperform rating on Repligen stock.


First Quarter Likely Within Views
---------------------------------


Repligen's first-quarter earnings will likely come in line with expectations, William Blair analyst John Kreger said in a report. This is because the company has an average 10-week lead time for its products.


"That said, we believe the pandemic has likely caused customers to focus on ensuring that current production schedules and operations remain on track, which may lead to a slowdown in orders while we are in the thick of the crisis," he said.


Kreger says it's likely Repligen could see an impact from the pandemic in the second and third quarters. But he eventually expects orders from biotech and pharma companies to resume their usual cadence when the pandemic's grip loosens.


He maintained his outperform rating on Repligen stock.


Repligen Stock Ranks Highly
---------------------------


Repligen stock ranks fifth in its industry group of medical-products companies, trailing **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), which is holding onto its No. 1 position. The group itself ranks No. 18 out of 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily.


Shares of Repligen have a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's key technical and fundamental growth. This puts Repligen stock in the top 2% of all stocks.

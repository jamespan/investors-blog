Graphics Processors In Short Supply
-----------------------------------


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is benefiting from strong demand for graphics processors for gaming PCs and data centers. Its processors are used in high-performance computing environments, including artificial intelligence applications.


Graphics processing units, or GPUs, are in short supply as 2021 begins, Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said in a note to clients Saturday. This situation is positive for Nvidia and rival **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), he says.


"While we would attribute gaming as the primary driver of demand, the sudden increase in cryptocurrency valuations has added another element to GPU consumption that should keep conditions tight and add to any benefit Nvidia is set to realize from its launch of Ampere into the notebook space this quarter," Bryson said.


Bryson rates Nvidia stock as outperform with a price target of 600.

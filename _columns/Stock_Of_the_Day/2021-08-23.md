Numerous Features On Snapchat App
---------------------------------


Snap calls itself a camera company. By downloading its Snapchat app to a smartphone, users have access to a wide range of features. The Snapchat app, which is free, initially hit the market in 2011.


Uers can discover and purchase fashion items, buy tickets, play games, catch up on news and entertainment and share their content with other Snapchat users. Snap is continuously adding new features and partnerships with other companies.


Another page on Snapchat, called Stories, holds a library of news reports, prank videos and chronicles of other strange occurrences. Snap also is developing original content.


During the second quarter daily active users of Snapchat jumped 23%, or 55 million, to 293 million.


Snap's IPO Was Largest Since Facebook
-------------------------------------


Snap burst onto the scene in 2017, with an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) that raised $3.4 billion and gave it a market valuation of $24 billion. That made [Snap the largest U.S.-listed IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) among tech companies since **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


But the party didn't last long as Snap stock tanked. It was a big target of Facebook, which had the Instagram platform. Facebook routinely copied the most popular features on Snapchat and applied them to Instagram.


Things have improved for Snap. Employing continuous innovation, Snap stock turned a corner long ago and now trades near record highs.


Snap's latest innovation is in the cutting-edge field of augmented reality, which overlays digital images and other information into a person's field of view. Applications for the technology include navigation, education, games, commerce and more. The good news for Snap is that not only is augmented reality entertaining, [it's also a revenue driver](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/snap-stock-climbs-as-it-engages-young-crowd/). Snap recently introduced an augmented reality feature it calls "TrueSize," which consumers can use as a shopping experience. Clothing company **FarFetch** ([FTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTCH)), for example, uses Snap's AR technology in a way that consumers can virtually try on and shop a variety of jackets.


Watchmaker Piaget uses it so that consumers can try on a variety of timepieces. Privately held Zenni Optical uses True Size technology to help Snapchat users try on lens frames.


**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) has integrated Snapchat's technology as part of its "Play New" advertising campaign.


Snap Stock Third-Quarter Outlook: Double-Digit Growth
-----------------------------------------------------


For its third quarter, Snap expects revenue in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion. That's an increase of about 58% to 60% and above estimates of $1.01 billion. It expects daily average users to grow 21% to 301 million.


In mid-May, Snap introduced its first [augmented reality smart glasses](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/augmented-reality-snap-beats-apple-to-market-with-ar-smart-glasses/) called Spectacles. The company previously released camera-embedded sunglasses under the same name. But the new Spectacles aren't for consumers yet. The company is making them available to software developers to see what sorts of applications they can create with them.


Other features on Snapchat include a news feed and games.

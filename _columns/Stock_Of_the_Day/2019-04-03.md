**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the maker of computer-aided design software received positive reviews for its annual investor day last Thursday.

Autodesk Stock Pivoting To Growth Story
---------------------------------------


Autodesk did a good job of explaining how the company is becoming a growth story after its multiyear transition to software-as-a-service from licensed software, he said. It also provided a deep dive into the opportunity it sees in providing [workflow software for the construction industry](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/autodesk-stock-construction-industry/), Hedberg said.


"We like the pivot to a growth story and potential for increased resiliency in a down cycle with about 95% recurring revenue," Hedberg said in a note to clients.


Oppenheimer analyst Koji Ikeda maintained his outperform rating and price target of 190 on Autodesk stock after the company event.


"We see Autodesk well positioned with its portfolio of applications, technology vision and referenceability to gain share in a large (roughly $59 billion) design-and-make total addressable market," he said in a report.


Relative Strength Line At New High
----------------------------------


Autodesk stock broke out of a 24-week consolidation period at a buy point of 160.04 on Feb. 13. However, the stock dropped out of the buy zone on March 1 after Autodesk reported [fiscal fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autodesk-earnings-q4-2019-autodesk-stock/).


The cloud software company delivered better-than-expected sales and earnings in the quarter ended Jan. 31, but gave mixed guidance. Its outlook for sales in its fiscal first quarter topped views, but earnings per share came up short.


Autodesk stock powered back into the buy zone on Monday. In a bullish sign, its relative strength line has hit a new high. Sponsorship in the stock also is good.

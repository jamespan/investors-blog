**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Chinese car-buying site surges past a buy point in heavy volume. The bullish move for Autohome stock provides investors a chance to get exposure to China amid renewed optimism for a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war.




Autohome Stock Action
---------------------


Autohome stock surged in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), blasting out of a cup-with-handle base with a 95.25 buy point. This [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) formed within a deep consolidation that dates back to last June.


Heavy trade accompanied Autohome's move. [Strong volume](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-read-stock-charts-price-and-volume/) is key for a breakout because it signals support from institutional investors.



While the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) for Autohome stock is still well below all-time levels reached last summer, it's passing a short-term peak from Dec. 11 — the day before the cup-with-handle base began to form.


Since the RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500, seeing the line at its highest level since the beginning of a base is bullish. Also, the RS line for our Stock Of The Day is passing its Feb. 27 high, which coincides with the start of Autohome's handle. That's another positive sign.


Autohome Also SwingTrader, Leaderboard Stock
--------------------------------------------


With this bullish move, Autohome stock was added to IBD's [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). In addition to strong technical action, today's Stock Of The Day has solid fundamentals. According to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com), earnings growth ranged between 32% and 53% over the last four quarters. That helps Autohome stock earn a near-best EPS Rating of 98.


[Annual earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/earnings-per-share-growth-stocks/) are projected to slow to 20% in 2019, followed by 18% bottom-line growth in 2020. While those numbers would mark a slowdown, that's still solid growth.


Trump Trade War Impact
----------------------


[Autohome CEO Min Lu noted](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4244410-autohome-inc-athm-ceo-min-lu-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) on the company's Feb. 26 quarterly conference call that "for 2018 and into 2019, trade war tension and the relative softness in Chinese economy and the automobile industry continued."


But with a potential Trump trade war resolution in sight as talks continue, Autohome's breakout could offer investors an opportunity to gain exposure to a potential rally in Chinese shares.


Positive Action Among China Stocks
----------------------------------


Autohome stock stands out compared with other China stocks showing positive action. **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) is staging a breakout over a cup-with-handle buy point of 42.05 Friday. But rather than forming a smaller cup-with-handle within a larger consolidation like Autohome stock, Huazhu's cup-with-handle base began last June and has a depth of 50%. Our research shows that bases deeper than 40% have a high chance of failing.


**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) has similar action to Huazhu stock. Shares have risen strongly this week, but the stock's base is very deep at 54%. And **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) is battling its way higher after selling off as much as 56% from June to October of last year.


While Huazhu, New Oriental and TAL Education are showing positive trading action, they're not in buy areas like Autohome is.

Coffee chain **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Starbucks stock is close to forming a flat base, and has outperformed a market shaken by recession anxieties and the U.S.-China trade war. Several other restaurant stocks are holding up well, including **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) and **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)).




Starbucks Stock
---------------


[Starbucks stock jumped](https://www.investors.com/news/starbucks-earnings-q319-due-starbucks-stock/) late last month to a record high after the coffeehouse giant reported strong quarterly results, boosted by sales growth in the U.S. and China. The company also raised its same-store sales and profit outlook.


Digital efforts, such as Starbucks' loyalty program and delivery platform, helped sales. The chain also saw growth in cold beverages. Starbucks' alliance with Nestle — which gave Nestle the rights to market packaged Starbucks products — also helped expand worldwide recognition for the coffee giant.


In Beijing, Starbucks has also built its first Starbucks Now store, geared toward mobile ordering. The new format could help Starbucks compete with Chinese rival **Luckin Coffee** ([LK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LK)), whose smaller, largely cashierless stores also cater to an on-the-go crowd ordering more things through their phones.


Starbucks earnings growth accelerated to 26% in the latest quarter, the best in years. That follows Starbucks earnings gains of 13%-15% in the prior four quarters. Sales growth was 8%, after gains of 5% and 9% in the prior two periods.


After the Starbucks stock earnings gap-up, trading has settled into a [three-weeks tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). A three-weeks-tight offers existing holders that opportunity to buy a few more shares. But by the end of the week, Starbucks stock could form a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/). The buy point would be 99.82.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which measures a stock's performance against the S&P 500, has ramped higher this year and is currently at all-time levels.


Starbucks stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 95.

**Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) following a surprise earnings gain for the iconic RV manufacturer. Fiscal first-quarter revenue growth was also much stronger than expected. Winnebago stock gapped higher, breaking out past a buy point.




Winnebago earnings unexpectedly rose 4% to 73 cents a share. Wall Street expected Winnebago earnings to slide 10% to 63 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Meanwhile, revenue jumped 19% to $588.46 million, well above views for $530 million. Organic revenue climbed 12%, driven by strong growth in the towable segment and modest growth in motor homes.


The firm is continuing to chase growth. Winnebago announced in September it would acquire RV firm Newmar for $344 million. The privately-owned firm manufactures premium motor homes and had revenue of $661 million over the last 12 months. The newly-acquired business added $35.7 million of revenue to Winnebago's Q1 sales.


Low gas prices and [high consumer confidence](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-deal-dow-jones-lift-economic-optimism-index/) form a good combination for RV dealers. The industry's products are mostly U.S. made, but many parts and materials are sourced from overseas and subject to trade-war tariffs. So pricing has felt some impact, according to the RV Industry Association.

Winnebago Stock Analysis
------------------------


Shares popped 8% to 51.98 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), just clearing a [buy point of 51.97](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).  Winnebago stock had built an eight-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Shares rose to 53.54 intraday and closed near session lows.


WGO stock recently found support at the 50-day/10-week moving average, but have now blasted well clear of these key technical benchmarks.


Winnebago stock has doubled so far in 2019. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) also has been making progress throughout 2019, and its strong results saw it drive back toward recent highs.


Winnebago stock has a strong, but not ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 90. This puts it in the top 9% of stocks tracked. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-winnebago-industries-inc-wgo.aspx) is flashing mixed signals, though its Relative Strength Rating of 96 underlines excellent recent stock market performance.



Winnebago earnings growth has averaged 6% over the past three quarters, which is well short of the [25% sought by the CAN SLIM cognoscente](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Longer-term earnings performance has been impressive however. Winnebago earnings have grown by an average of 29% over the past three years.


Analysts expected Winnebago earnings to rise 14% to $3.90 in fiscal 2020 even before the Q1 beat. Fiscal 2021 EPS should climb 20% to $4.68.


Institutional support for WGO stock is strong. This is important, as it makes up another key piece of the CAN SLIM jigsaw. In total, half of its shares are currently held by institutional investors. In addition, Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- shows big money has been snapping up Winnebago stock over the past 13 weeks.


RV rival **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), which reported mixed quarterly results earlier this month, rose 2.1% to a 13-month high Friday. It is now extended beyond buy range.


Analyst Cautious On Winnebago Stock
-----------------------------------


CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his hold rating on Winnebago stock following earnings, though he raised his price target by 7 to 52. He continues to have concerns about the firm's performance.


"The gross margin contracted 100 bps to 13.4% due to a change in mix as a result of the Newmar acquisition (Motor home adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 250 bps to 4.1% in the quarter) and purchase accounting-related impacts," he said in a research note. "We maintain a Hold, as the stock's strong recent performance keeps us on the sidelines, and we see the Newmar acquisition continuing to weigh on margins, as it increased WGO's Motor home exposure."

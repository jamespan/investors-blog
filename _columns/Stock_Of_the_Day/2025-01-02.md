Pipeline company Kinetik Holdings is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Thursday as oil and gas prices climbed to three-month highs. Among other oil and natural gas stocks, **EQT** ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)) and **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) are near buy zones. Meanwhile, [Warren Buffett holding](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks-january-2025/) **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) is close to regaining a key technical level.




[Oil prices climbed early Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-natural-gas-prices-near-breakouts-eqt-lng-oxy-rise/) to their highest level since October. The Energy Information Administration reported a sixth straight weekly decline in storage levels, although the draw was smaller than expected.


West Texas Intermediate futures rose 2.5% to $73.50 a barrel, after earlier rising to $73.73, the highest level since mid-October. WTI hit a 2024 high near $87 in April.


Crude has been more or less range-bound below the October highs and lows around $67. But Thursday's move sparked by American Petroleum Institute data showed the commodity breaking out of its recent range.


API data released late Tuesday showed crude oil stockpiles fell by 1.442 million barrels in the week through Dec. 27, following a 3.2-million-barrel decline the prior week. Energy Information Administration data released at 11 a.m. Thursday showed crude oil inventories down 1.2 million barrels, though some forecasters expected a 2.8-million drop.


Natural gas futures prices rose 1.8% to $3.70 per million Btu. Thursday's move carried natural gas prices clear of the January 2023 interim high.

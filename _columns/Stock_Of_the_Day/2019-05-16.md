**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it closes in on a buy opportunity, thanks to an eight-month-long base.




The buy point of 1,964.50 will kick in if Amazon stock breaks out past that entry in a long [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) that began forming in September. Amazon stock rose nearly 2% to 1,907.57 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The stock underwent a 36% correction during the base formation, from the left-side high to the bottom of the base, which is on the steep side. But trading has smoothed out in the past few months, with Amazon stock climbing off the 50-day moving average the past three days and moving toward the buy point.


Among recent [buyers of the stock is Warren Buffett](https://www.investors.com/news/warren-buffett-amazon-stake-q1-2019-13-f/), revealed in the **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BKRB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKRB)) 13-F report on Wednesday. It showed a new $900 million stake in Amazon, as the investment group picked up about 483,000 shares.

Amazon Stock Checkup
--------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows that Amazon has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99 out of a best-possible 99, meaning the stock ranks highest in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 87, which reflects strong [stock market performance.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/) has been trending higher.


Amazon stock has a stellar 99 [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1), which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth against all other stocks.


[Amazon reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/tech-leaders/amazon-stock-earnings-one-day-shipping/) on April 25 that smashed Wall Street estimates. Its adjusted profit of $7.09 a share surged 117% from the year-ago period and trounced views for $4.72.


Revenue was up 17% from the year-ago period, beating estimates. But that was its slowest growth rate in 16 quarters.


Slowing Earnings Growth
-----------------------


The company has produced triple-digit or higher earnings growth the past five quarters, but growth is expected to slow to 8% in the second quarter. Amazon stock rose 2.5% in reaction to the earnings report.


Among the report's highlights, Amazon Web Services reported revenue of $7.69 billion, up 41% from the year-ago period, with operating income of $2.2 billion for the cloud-computing unit. Its cloud unit is poised to sustain a growth rate of more than 40% for the tenth straight year.


For its second quarter, Amazon expects net sales in the range of $59.5 billion to $63.5 billion, or growth of 13% to 20%. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $3.6 billion, compared with $3 billion in the year-ago period.


Amazon Business Expansion
-------------------------


As growth in Amazon's core e-commerce business slows, the company actively pursues new business opportunities. These include its expansion into groceries and apparel. Amazon also has a sizable presence in India, where it started doing business in 2013 and has invested about $6 billion.


Amazon also has plans to offer free one-day shipping to its Amazon Prime customers. The e-commerce giant hasn't said when the change will kick in, but it's spending $800 million as part of the push. It's also exploring the health care market, having acquired online pharmacy company PillPack last year for just under $1 billion.


Amazon currently holds the No. 1 ranking among its peers in IBD's Retail/Internet industry group. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is second, then **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)). The group ranks 19th among 197 sectors in recent performance.

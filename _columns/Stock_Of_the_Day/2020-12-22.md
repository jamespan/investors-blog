**Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the wireless chipmaker is seen getting a lift from 5G smartphone sales.

Qorvo Stock Named Top Stock Pick For 2021
-----------------------------------------


Last week, BofA Securities named Qorvo as one of its [11 stock picks for 2021](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-bank-america-names-11-top-stock-picks-2021/).


On Dec. 8, Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman said Qorvo stock was one of his firm's "best ideas" for 2021.


The Greensboro, N.C.-based company will benefit from the "once-in-a-decade shift" to next-generation cellular technology. It is exposed to both 5G smartphones and infrastructure, Ackerman said in a note to clients.


The shift to 5G remains in its early innings, he says. Qorvo is seeing a 40%-plus content lift in smartphones vs. 4G wireless, Ackerman said. Qorvo provides chips to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), Samsung and other smartphone vendors.


Ackerman rates Qorvo stock as outperform with a price target of 225.


5G Wireless Transition Once-In-A-Decade Shift
---------------------------------------------


"The once-in-a-decade shift to 5G is on full display with content increasing considerably above smartphone units," he said. "It's not just smartphones; 5G infrastructure, smart speakers, automotive and wearables are all benefiting from the convergence of 5G cellular and Wi-Fi 6."


Qorvo stock is tied for second place in IBD's semiconductor manufacturing industry group. It shares an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a possible 99 with **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) is the top-ranked stock in the group with a Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating.


Qorvo stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 81 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 81% of stocks over the past 12 months.Â The best growth stocks typically have RS Ratings of at least 80.


It has an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, indicating moderate institutional buying of shares.

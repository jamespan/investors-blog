**Clarivate** ([CCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the global provider of intellectual property data builds a flat base following its agreement to merge with CPA Global, forming an industry powerhouse. Clarivate stock faces a test of its 10-week moving average.




Shares popped nearly 22% on July 29 after it announced the $6.8 billion deal with CPA Global. With a seven-week flat base forming, Clarivate stock has forged a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 30.05.


Shares are getting close to the stock's [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), but that line is moving up, a bullish sign. Shares climbed 2.4% to close at 29.45 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


CPA Global sells IP software and technology-enabled services to law firms and corporate customers such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)), and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)). CPA shareholders will own 35% of the combined company.


Clarivate Stock: CPA Global Merger Synergies
--------------------------------------------


The merger is expected to close in the December-ending quarter of 2020.


"We see CPA as highly complementary to Clarivate's existing IP franchise, which currently represents 33% of total revenue," RBC Capital analyst Seth Weber said in a recent note to clients. "The combination creates the leading provider of global IP services spanning patents and designs, trademarks, case law and domains."


Weber added: "The transaction more than doubles the size of Clarivate's IP business, and, while revenue synergies are not part of the outlook, we see good opportunity to leverage CPA's software/tech to bundle and cross-sell."

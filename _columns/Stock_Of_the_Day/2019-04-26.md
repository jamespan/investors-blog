**Strategic Education** ([STRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRA)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The for-profit university operator is trading near a buy point ahead of earnings following a big merger last year. Strategic Education stock gets high marks from IBD ratings.




Strategic Education Earnings Due
--------------------------------


On Wednesday, Strategic Education reports first-quarter earnings. Analysts expect earnings to rise 16% to $1.43 a share while revenue soars 107% to $240 million. The revenue gain is almost entirely due to a merger completed last August with industry peer Capella Education Co.


Prior to the merger, Strategic Education was known as Strayer Education.


The company makes money via enrollments at Strayer University, an educational institution founded in 1892 that offers courses at physical campuses and online for subjects like business administration, accounting and IT. Strayer University has more than 70 physical campuses, largely in the eastern U.S.


Strategic Education also draws money from Capella University, the online postsecondary education firm it got via the merger with Capella Education.

CLOSE




Strategic Education Stock
-------------------------


Strategic Education stock rose 2.6% to close at 144.82 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). Shares are moving toward a 151.28 buy point of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/).



The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of Strategic Education stock is 94 out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a measure of profit growth, is a weaker, at 79. That's due to a 5% three-year EPS growth rate and an average annual decline of 5% over the past five years.


Stock Of The Day Earnings Growth Improves
-----------------------------------------


But more recent earnings growth has been better, with gains of 36%, 15%, 29%, 34%, 171% and 43% in the past six quarters.


Strayer Education stock soared 11% on March 1 following that 43% EPS gain, forming the start of the current handle.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which measures a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is trading close to the short-term handle high, but still below its consolidation peak.


Other School Stocks Looking Strong
----------------------------------


The largest stocks in the Commercial Services-Education group are China-based **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)). Both stocks rallied this week on earnings, despite weak revenue guidance. TAL Education cleared a buy point from a deep base Friday.


As for U.S.-based education plays, Grand Canyon University stock rose 1.75% to 122.42 on Thursday, hitting its best level since last November. **Grand Canyon University** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)), which offers a physical campus and heavy online offerings, this week moved back above a 120 buy point from an awkward-looking cup-with-handle.


Chegg stock climbed 2.2% to 40, rebounding from its 50-day line. **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), which sells textbooks and has online offerings, is in a flat base with a 41.79 buy point. Late Monday, Chegg stock reports earnings.


New Oriental Education stock, which is extended from a buy point, has a 96 Composite Rating. TAL Education has a 94 CR. Chegg stock is at 93 and Grand Canyon stock at 91.


Consolidating A Scattered Industry
----------------------------------


Strategic Education served more than 90,000 students across the U.S. as of the end of 2018. The deal also helped consolidate what the Strategic Education has described as a competitive but fragmented postsecondary education market.


When the deal closed, the companies said the combination would enable both Strayer University and Capella University to speed "innovations that improve affordability and enhance academic and career outcomes for students."


For-Profit Regulation Eases
---------------------------


But the merger, which announced in late 2017, came after a crackdown on for-profit colleges by the Obama administration. The Obama administration was concerned about the schools' recruitment practices. It also tried to ensure that the schools weren't misleading students in their advertising and heaping debt on them without adequate education and training.


The for-profit industry [has rebounded since President Donald Trump took office](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/charter-schools-education-betsy-devos/), thanks largely to the appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. DeVos has taken a lighter approach to scrutinizing the industry.


During the fourth quarter, which Strategic Education reported in March, student enrollment at Strayer University rose 8.9% to 52,447. Enrollment at Capella University 2.4% to 38,409 students.

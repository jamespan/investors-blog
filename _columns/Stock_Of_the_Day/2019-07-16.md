[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) built its initial public offering around what is billed as an easy-to-use, highly reliable videoconferencing platform.




For jittery investors, there's worry that the hot IPOs of 2019 could suddenly sell off. Zoom stock bulls, however, point to its first earnings report as proof that there's staying power in its business model.


Zoom stock soared 72% on its first day of trading on April 18. That kind of gain raises questions over whether the company left money on the table by pricing its IPO shares at 36. Shares rallied further, boosted in part by better-than-expected earnings reported on June 6. Zoom stock hit an intraday high of 107.34 on June 20, up 198% from its IPO price.


Shares pulled back 11% on June 24, a day that many hot technology IPOs and software growth stocks retreated.

To form a proper entry point, Zoom stock now needs to [form a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's in a similar position to another hot IPO, **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)). Beyond Meat stock was Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day.


Hot IPOs can be volatile, so it's important for investors to look for a consolidation that indicates institutional buying has kicked in.


It could take Zoom stock a few more weeks to form a proper base.


If Zoom stock hits a new high before forging a proper base, aggressive investors could treat 107.44 — 10 cents over the previous high — as an entry point.


Zoom Stock: Videoconferencing In Early Innings?
-----------------------------------------------


That's the technical picture. Zoom stock bulls, meanwhile, point to the fact that it's already profitable on an adjusted basis, unlike many of this year's tech IPOs. One of them, **Slack Technologies** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)), is an [important partner of Zoom](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-stock-ipo-collaborative-philosophy/).


Zoom's revenue comes from cloud-based software that sets up videoconferencing, with chat tools also available. Customers also can easily share content.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx), Zoom Video has an IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97 out of a possible 99.


Goldman Sachs on June 30 downgraded Zoom Video to sell, citing its lofty valuation. Zoom Video's trading multiple exceeded that of high-growth enterprise software companies, Goldman Sachs said.


William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri, in a July 12 report, said Zoom Video merits a high valuation because videoconferencing for businesses one day will be as routine as audio calling.


"Zoom is benefiting from a secular shift to video communications — still in early innings — which should continue to drive robust growth and best-in-class operating metrics for years to come," he wrote.


Zoom Stock: Can Cisco Match Video Quality?
------------------------------------------


Zoom's ability to interoperate with many third-party software applications helps it compete against incumbents in videoconferencing software: **Cisco System**s ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)).


There is a concern, though, that Cisco or Microsoft could upgrade their videoconferencing products and match Zoom's user experience.


Zoom's basic video-calling package is free. Zoom puts limits on the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings. Paid Zoom plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats.


First-quarter revenue for Zoom jumped 103% to $122 million, topping estimates of $111.7 million. That was the eighth straight quarter of triple-digit top-line growth.


For the current quarter ending in July, Zoom forecast revenue of $129.5 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of $123 million. The company said it expects full-year sales of $537.5 million. Analysts had projected $525 million.


Some analysts expect upside from international. In the April quarter, international sales made up 20% of Zoom's revenue and grew at 127% year over year.


Zoom stock fell 2.7% to close at 97.10 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

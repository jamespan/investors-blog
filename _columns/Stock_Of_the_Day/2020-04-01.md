Zscaler stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm's relative strength reaps gains against the S&P 500 amid a work-from-home boom driven by the coronavirus pandemic.




Many companies have deployed virtual private networks, or VPNs, a type of business connection, to support [employees working from home](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/working-from-home-will-social-distance-outlast-coronavirus-emergency/). **Zscaler**'s ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) Private Access, or ZPA cloud service, is an alternative to VPNs.


Dougherty & Co. on March 27 initiated coverage on Zscaler with a buy rating.


"WFH (work from home) solutions are getting top priority and driving demand for remote access solutions, such as Zscaler's ZPA product, over legacy VPN," Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick said in a report to clients. "We expect ZPA sales to increase as its main use case is VPN replacement."


She added that some large deals may not have closed yet, though.


San Jose, Calif-based Zscaler owns a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) of 94 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. An upward-trending [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


Another plus is that Zscaler stock has moved above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Despite a sharp market downturn, shares climbed 1.9% to close at 61.99 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

Zscaler Stock Fell On Palo Alto Network Worries
-----------------------------------------------


Even so, the stock market is now in a correction. It's not a good time to be buying most stocks. Zscaler stock has clawed back during the coronavirus emergency, and has been [forming a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) over the past seven weeks. Investors should be cautious on Zscaler given its chart, which shows a deep correction.


The initial public offering for Zscaler stock in March 2018 raised $192 million. Zscaler stock hit an all-time high of 89.54 on July 26. The stock then broke down amid worries over increased competition with **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) as well as sales turnover.


Palo Alto on Tuesday [made an acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-stock-sd-wan-cloudgenix-acquisition/) that could impact Zscaler, some analysts say.


CEO Blog Touts Cloud ZPA Service
--------------------------------


Zscaler Chief Executive Jay Chaudry, in a March 15 [blog post](https://ir.zscaler.com/investor-relations), said the company saw increased demand for the ZPA service.


"In recent weeks, as COVID-19 spread, enterprises have reached out to us to help them achieve this same level of productivity by providing access to all internal and external applications as quickly as possible," Chaudry wrote.


He went on to say: "Since Jan. 1, our overall traffic has more than tripled, driven in large part by existing customers fully taking advantage of ZPA; our China traffic has increased more than 12 (times); Seoul is up 6 (times); Tokyo has more than doubled; and our newly opened Milan data center quickly became one of the busiest sites across the Zscaler cloud."


Zscaler's cloud-based cybersecurity services have been installed at 150 data centers worldwide.


Customers Adding Capacity
-------------------------


For the most part, Zscalar says existing customers have added capacity. One multinational company that it didn't name went from 20,000 to 100,000 work-from-home employees between March 15 and March 20. It plans to ramp to 300,000.


Zscaler stock has benefited as more companies shift to software-defined wide area networking, or SD-WAN. The new computer networking technology enables companies to tap bandwidth on the public internet rather than lease private data connections.


Many Zscaler customers deploy SD-WAN to help employees in branch offices. They also use it to get access for remote workers to software apps such as Microsoft Office 365.

Credit-card giant **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Even with a stock market correction underway due to the escalating China trade war, Visa stock remains near record highs. Shares rebounded from a key support level Tuesday. So did archrival **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)).




Visa Stock Is A Buy, Except For This
------------------------------------


As of Tuesday, that support appeared to be robust. Visa stock rose 1.8% to 160.21 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), getting a bounce off its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Mutual funds and other big institutions often step in to support top stocks at this key support level. Visa stock broke out from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base on Feb. 1.


This is the [first test of the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) or 10-week average after that breakout. Normally that would represent a buying opportunity for existing holders and aggressive investors. But Monday's big sell-off triggered a stock market correction call as Beijing retaliated vs. new U.S. tariffs in an escalating China trade war. IBD research advises investors to avoid buying in a correction.


Perhaps Visa stock will form a short flat base or other consolidation in the coming weeks and break out with a better stock market climate.


Already, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) of Visa stock touched a record high on Tuesday, indicating broader outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index. Stocks that hold up well during a correction can sometimes be the next leaders once the market turns north.


The Dow Jones stock boasts a 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a measure of accelerating profits, stands at 94. One concern is that Visa earnings growth has decelerated for the past three quarters, from 40% to 18%. Analysts expect a 10% gain in the current quarter. But they see 16% Visa earnings growth in fiscal 2019 and 2020.


Mastercard Stock Also Bullish
-----------------------------


Mastercard stock also has a 98 Composite Rating. The Visa archrival also has an RS line at a record, with shares not far from all-time levels. Mastercard stock rallied 1.9% Tuesday, rebounding from its 10-week line. That would be a buying opportunity for Mastercard stock, were it not for the stock market correction.


Both Visa and Mastercard stocks belong to IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors group, which holds a No. 14 ranking out of 197 industry groups tracked.


Visa Payments Options Expand
----------------------------


Visa stock has risen steadily since the company went public more than a decade ago, as consumers spent more during the long economic rebound and began using electronic, digital and mobile payments. The company has also grown and tried to keep apace with payments trends via partnerships and acquisitions.


In the latest quarter, Visa earnings topped expectations. Visa stuck with its full-year sales forecast but raised its EPS growth forecast. Payments and cross-border volume rose. The company also cited growth in contactless cards in markets like the U.S. and Canada.


William Blair analyst Robert Napoli said the company was on solid ground.


"We believe technology is driving growth and spurring the secular shift to electronic payments as access to Visa's network expands," he wrote in a research note in April. "We believe Visa is able to provide solutions to help companies navigate the accelerating pace of change.


"Management has previously said the Internet of Things, the growth of connected devices, growth of push payments, and payment tokens are expanding the 'ways to pay' and 'ways to be paid.'"

**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the online payment giant tried to muscle into the buy zone Wednesday. PayPal stock rose 1.7.% to 85.96 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It hit 86.97 intraday, a new all-time high and briefly topping an 86.42 buy point.




PayPal's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500, hit an all-time high. That offers bullish confirmation PayPal's breakout attempt.


PayPal previously cleared a flattish [double-bottom-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) entry of 84.09 last month, but the move came in light volume, which is not a great sign.


Wednesday's rally also appears to be on below-average trade.


PayPal Acquisitions Touted
--------------------------


Analysts said Wednesday that [PayPal is gaining scale against rivals](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-acquisitions-square-adyen/) such as **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) thanks to recent acquisitions. PayPal on Tuesday said it would buy Hyperwallet Systems for $400 million. In May, PayPal agreed to buy iZettle, a European mobile-payment rival to Square and others, for $2.2 billion.


PayPal Stock Fundamentals
-------------------------


A key to PayPal stock's ongoing success is its stellar fundamentals. It currently holds an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 97, which puts it in the top 3% of stocks tracked. PayPal also holds an excellent EPS Rating of 95 and a muscular Relative Strength Rating of 85.



It is also one of the top members of the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry. The firm is just behind group leader **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Wex** ([WEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEX)), **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), and **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), a recent IBD Stock of the Day.

**Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as one Wall Street analyst says the streaming music giant is on pace to reach 1 billion monthly active users worldwide by 2030. Spotify stock is near a buy point.




In a client note Sunday, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson predicted that Spotify could achieve over 1 billion monthly active users and over 400 million premium subscribers by 2030. Those estimates are above Wall Street's forecasts by 3% and 4%, respectively, he said.


"We believe this supports at least 15% annual (revenue) growth, with potential to achieve Spotify's 20%+ target as new products ramp," Patterson said. "With consensus looking for just 11% annual revenue growth, we believe 2030 (estimated) earnings power is materially understated."


Spotify ended the [second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-q2-2024-earnings/) with 626 million monthly active users and 246 million premium subscribers. Spotify offers an ad-supported service in addition to its commercial-free subscription service.


Patterson reiterated his overweight rating on Spotify stock and raised his price target to 440 from 420.

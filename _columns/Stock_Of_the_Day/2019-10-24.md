Pinduoduo Stock Soars On Earnings Report
----------------------------------------


Pinduoduo reported [second-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinduoduo-earnings-second-quarter-stock/) on Aug. 21 that crushed Wall Street estimates. Pinduoduo stock vaulted 16% in reaction to the report.


Second-quarter revenue soared 169% from the year-ago period, in Chinese currency, to $1.06 billion. That beat expectations of $878.8 million. It reported an adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, Wall Street expected an adjusted loss of 19 cents.


Pinduoduo has yet to show a profit but is expected to move into the black next year. Revenue has grown at a triple-digit rate for the past four quarters. Wall Street expects revenue this year of about $4 billion, more than double that from the prior year.


The company's e-commerce platform offers a wide range of products, including apparel and shoes, products for moms, furniture, household goods and electronics. It also sells food and beverages.


Annual spending per active buyer in the 12-month period ended June 30 jumped 92% to $213.80. Over the same time period, gross merchandise volume processed on its site soared 171% to more than $103 billion. Average monthly active users soared 88% to 366 million.


Backers Include Tencent Holdings
--------------------------------


Backers of Pinduoduo include China-based **Tencent Holdings**, ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) a leader in messaging, mobile payments and mobile gaming in China. Tencent supports Pinduoduo with services such as payment solutions, cloud services and user engagement via Tencent's WeChat mobile platform.


Pinduoduo is different from Alibaba and JD.com in that the social networking features on its e-commerce site, helped by Tencent, enable a team approach to buying, at discounted prices. It enables sellers on the platform to receive bulk purchases, providing economies of scale that can lower costs.


A big positive for Pinduoduo stock is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which is at a record high.

That's a bullish signal. That means it has outperformed 99% of all stocks.

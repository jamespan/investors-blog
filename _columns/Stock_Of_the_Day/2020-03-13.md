**Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as MASI stock outlasts the coronavirus correction that's slamming other medical players.




This month, MASI stock had climbed 10% as of Thursday's close. In comparison, its peers in the medical-systems and equipment industry group have collectively slumped 14%. Still, the group is ranked 10th out of 197 groups Investor's Business Daily tracks. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), MASI stock added 4.1% to 186.78.


Needham analyst Mike Matson says MASI stock stands a chance of benefiting from worries over Covid-19, a [new form of coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-hunt-sends-biotech-companies-scrambling-treat-covid-19/) discovered four months ago in China. Masimo sells noninvasive patient monitoring systems.


"We think that Masimo is the least vulnerable to a Covid-19 pandemic since it has limited exposure to China, moderate exposure to Europe, could actually see increased demand from Covid-19 and has the strongest balance sheet," Matson said in a recent note to clients.

MASI Stock Outlasts Coronavirus Woes
------------------------------------


Since its discovery, the [new form of coronavirus](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) has sickened more than 137,000 people across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins. More than 5,000 people have died, though it's also important to note that almost 70,000 have recovered.


Amid coronavirus worries, international markets and supply chains have slowed. The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) also has been slammed. Over the last week, the S&P 500 tumbled 7% twice in a span of hours. That prompted temporary 15-minute halts each time.


But MASI stock continues to hold its own. Shares remain above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 160.35 out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) achieved in early January and above the 50-day moving average. But IBD urges investors to avoid buying stocks during a market correction. The medical stock is now roughly 12% above its entry.


That's because Masimo has limited exposure to the markets where the [new coronavirus, dubbed Covid-19](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/gild-stock-pops-coronavirus-treatment-reportedly-shows-promise-japan/), has taken a dominant hold, Needham's Matson said. The lion's share of cases are in China and Italy. Cases are growing in Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, France and the U.S.


How MASI Stock Could Benefit
----------------------------


Further, Matson notes Masimo could actually benefit from Covid-19. Masimo sells tests for pulse oximetry. [Pulse oximetry](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/pulse-oximetry) measures the oxygen level in a patient's blood. But this method of testing is often plagued by false readings, Masimo says.


Masimo says its tools have solved this problem and deliver fewer false alarms.


In a study of [pulse oximetry tests](https://www.masimo.com/technology/co-oximetry/set/) in infants, Masimo's tools missed 1% of true events and delivered false alarms in 2% of cases. One rival missed 4% of true events and 43% of its alarms were false. Another missed 6% of true events and delivered false alarms in 12% of cases.


"Masimo's SET pulse oximetry products are frequently used on patients admitted to hospitals and it has seen stronger growth during severe flu seasons," Needham's Matson said.



Representatives of Masimo didn't immediately return a request for comment from IBD.


Fourth-Quarter Earnings Were Robust
-----------------------------------


Business trends also remain strong, UBS analyst Matthew Taylor said after Masimo delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.


[During the quarter](https://investor.masimo.com/news/news-details/2020/Masimo-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Financial-Results/default.aspx), revenue popped nearly 11% to $247.5 million. Adjusted income of 91 cents a share also beat Masimo's own guidance by 4 cents, Taylor said. On a year-over-year basis, Masimo earnings advanced more than 12%.


The medical company also guided to $1.04 billion in full-year product sales. Product sales — which excludes royalties and other revenue — would rise almost 11% vs. the prior year. After the earnings report, MASI stock briefly dipped back into a buy zone.


UBS analyst Taylor is bullish on MASI stock. He has a buy rating and raised his price target to 207 from 190.


"We continue to view Masimo as a unique growth asset with a very leverageable business model and exciting new products that can sustain growth," he said in a report.


MASI Stock Has High Ratings
---------------------------


Shares of MASI stock have a nearly perfect IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. This puts MASI stock in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical growth metrics.


Further, MASI stock has an IBD [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 96. The RS Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. So, MASI stock ranks in the top 4% of all stocks on this measurement.

Expedia is the [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Thursday as the travel industry continues rebounding from October lows.




Online travel and booking site **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) has successfully turned around its earnings after reporting a net loss of $8.78 per share amid the Covid pandemic. In subsequent years, the owner of Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity and Trivago reported earnings of $1.65 per share in 2021, growing to $6.79 per share in 2022.


Expedia in November [reported Q3 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/expedia-stock-rallies-as-resilient-travel-demand-fuels-earnings-beat-record-revenue/) well above estimates on record revenue for the period due to resilient travel demand, and analysts broadly expect that trend to continue.


A number of firms hoisted their price targets on EXPE stock in January following its late 2023 rally.


B. Riley on Jan. 4 raised its price target on Expedia to $200 from $160 on expectations of "sustained healthy growth" for the business, and margin expansion over the short and medium-term. The company also announced a $5 billion stock repurchase plan in its Q3 results and sports "strong and growing" free cash flows, analyst Naved Khan wrote in a research note. B. Riley maintained a buy rating on EXPE stock.


Argus on Jan. 4 named Expedia one of its top picks for 2024, noting that its risk vs. reward profile is more favorable than its leisure competitors. The firm has a $171 price target on EXPE shares and a buy rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target on Expedia to $180 from $135 on Jan. 8 and maintained a buy rating on the stock. Elsewhere, Mizuho on Jan. 17 lifted its price target on EXPE to $130 from $110 with a neutral rating.


Meanwhile, the Leisure-Travel Booking industry group rebounded more than 31% from its late October lows. EXPE stock rallied 60% since the beginning of November.

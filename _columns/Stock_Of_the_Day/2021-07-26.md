AI-Powered Cybersecurity
------------------------


SentinelOne makes cybersecurity solutions powered by artificial intelligence. Its offerings cover prevention, detection, response and hunting across endpoints, containers, cloud workloads, and Internet of Things devices from a single autonomous platform.


At least 13 Wall Street firms initiated coverage of SentinelOne stock on Monday. Of those, 11 gave it buy ratings while two were neutral.


"A rapidly changing threat environment requires an adaptable, data-driven approach to security, which SentinelOne provides with its AI-powered 'XDR' platform," Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala said in a note to clients. XDR stands for "[extended detection and response](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/extended-detection-response-xdr/)."


Legacy cybersecurity tools have not kept pace with the fast-changing threat landscape, he said. SentinelOne's platform better adapts to evolving threats by evaluating threat data in real time using machine learning and artificial intelligence, Fodderwala said.


Competes With CrowdStrike
-------------------------


The shift to cloud computing and remote work has increased the need for more capable cybersecurity solutions, he said.


Fodderwala rates SentinelOne stock as overweight, or buy, with a price target of 56.


SentinelOne competes with **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and others in the next-generation cybersecurity market.


Wells Fargo Securities analyst Andrew Nowinski started coverage of SentinelOne stock with an overweight rating and price target of 55.


"We believe SentinelOne can drive revenue growth for the foreseeable future simply by continuing to take share from the legacy endpoint security providers (McAfee, Symantec/Broadcom, Trend Micro), which have not kept pace with the innovation of SentinelOne," Nowinski said in a note to clients.


SentinelOne Stock In Hot Industry Group
---------------------------------------


SentinelOne currently ranks No. 24 out of 36 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-sentinelone-inc-cl-a-s.aspx). That group ranks No. 45 from the top of the list of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/) recommend focusing on top-rated stocks in leading industry groups.


SentinelOne stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 47 out of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group.


It has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 61 out of 99. That means SentinelOne stock has outperformed 61% of stocks over the past 12 months. But that score is relatively low due to SentinelOne's brief trading history.

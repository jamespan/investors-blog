United Rentals Earnings Beefing Up
----------------------------------


United Rentals reported Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $9.27, up 41% vs a year earlier. Quarterly sales grew by 18%, slightly less than the 21% to 23% range in the prior three quarters.


Management raised the low end of its full-year 2022 revenue guidance and raised its adjusted EBITDA in the Oct. 26 earnings release.


Analysts are projecting annual EPS of $32.61 in 2022, a 48% increase. Another 12% growth is expected in 2023.


URI has a 31% return on equity, a measure of profitability and how well a company uses its assets. This exceeds the desired minimum of 17% ROE in the [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) investing strategy.


Equipment Stock Strong In The Fourth Quarter
--------------------------------------------


United Rentals stock rose 0.5% to 347.29 in Tuesday's market trading. Shares have been consolidating for the past few weeks. But that follows a strong run-up in the first half of the fourth quarter, helped by strong third-quarter earnings released in late October.


URI stock gapped up on Nov. 10 in heavy [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/), on positive inflation news and jobless claims numbers, and an announcement it will partner with **Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)) for their all-electric trucks. United Rentals will provide EV trucks to Shell's Geismar, La., chemical manufacturing site as part of a pilot program.

Breaking the downtrend of the handle could offer an early entry, with a move above Friday's high of 358.56 providing a specific trigger.



URI stock rose above theÂ [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) following the Q3 earnings report.

Shares are up a whopping 28% in the fourth quarter-to-date. Shares are about 6% off 52-week highs. The stock has an 89 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), meaning it has outperformed 89% of the stocks in the IBD database in the last 12 months, showing its dominance.


Heavy Equipment Stocks Pull Their Weight
----------------------------------------


Heavy equipment manufacturers such as **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), **Terex** ([TEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEX)) and **Titan Machinery** ([TITN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TITN)) have also proved strong in the fourth quarter. CAT is up over 41% and DE is up over 30% this quarter, while TEX is up over 50% and TITN is up 48%.


The overall industry sees strong demand and higher prices as a headwind for stock prices, with potential higher infrastructure spending.

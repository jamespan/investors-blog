**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as ANET stock has formed a bullish chart pattern.




The provider of computer networking gear has formed a double-bottom base with a handle, a [bullish chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) commonly formed by top stocks, alongside the venerable [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Spotting a good double bottom just may lead to rewarding gains if it shows a [strong breakout in big volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


The ANET stock pattern shows a buy point of 132.97. Shares dropped 2.7% to close at 123.03 on Friday, which proved to be a difficult day for markets overall.


At its core, the [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) is shaped like the letter W. But an important distinction is that the second leg down should undercut the first, which it does in this case.

How Arista Beat Wall Street Views

Arista reported [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/anet-stock-arista-earnings-arista-stock-q22022/) on Aug. 1 that beat estimates on earnings and revenue. Arista earnings rose 59% from a year earlier to $1.08 per share, topping estimates of 92 cents.


Further, revenue grew 49% to $1.05 billion vs. forecasts for $979 million, topping the $1 billion mark for the first time.


For the third quarter, Arista said it expects revenue in a range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion. ANET stock analysts had predicted revenue of $996 million.


"We like Arista's long-term growth opportunity but remain on the sidelines on valuation," Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron wrote in a note to clients following the earnings report.


KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Thomas Blakely reiterated an overweight rating and price target of 170.

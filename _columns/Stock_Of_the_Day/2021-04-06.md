Yeti stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ibdtipp-poll-economic-optimism-index/) as the maker of coolers, backpacks, beverage containers and other outdoor gear briefly moved into a buy zone intraday.




The advance follows a year in which more people tried to find solace in the outdoors, after coronavirus restrictions kept people away from gyms, bars and restaurants.


**Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)), when it reported fourth-quarter earnings in February, said it expected the trend of more outdoor activity to continue this year.


Indeed, airlines have expanded aggressively to new routes, with a focus on popular destinations for outdoor activity. The pace of vaccinations is also lifting air travel, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave a conditional OK for vaccinated people to take to the skies again.


Known for high-end coolers that cost as much as $1,300, Yeti also launched a new line of travel bags and luggage in February.


Yeti Stock
----------


Shares pared gains to close up 3% at 75.06 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), after topping a 76.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) intraday from a consolidation pattern. Yeti stock also broke a short-term downtrend, another bullish signal, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Shares began a long rebound last March. That advance hit an intraday high in January, and cooled off afterward. Over that time, the stock has seesawed above and below its 50-day line. The stock has been above that line since late last month.


Yeti stock has an 89 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The stock's [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 81. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) of Yeti stock has moved sideways since January.


Along with Yeti stock, companies like **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) have benefited from a migration to outdoor activity during the pandemic. But the pandemic has also driven people toward at-home fitness options, like those offered by **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) and **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


Dick's last month gave [cautious full-year profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/dks-stock-dicks-sporting-goods-earnings-q4-2020/). But its fourth-quarter results beat forecasts.

Other Benefits, Risks To Yeti
-----------------------------


In February, when Yeti reported fourth-quarter earnings, its profit outlook for the year came in above Wall Street's expectations. Results for the quarter also beat estimates. Demand for new drink container products and coolers helped lift the results.


During Yeti's fourth-quarter earnings conference call, CEO Matt Reintjes said the company had benefited from "a more active lifestyle and a greater appreciation for outdoor activities and recreations."


"The pandemic furthered these behaviors," he said, "including a well-documented increase in vacations closer to home."


William Blair analysts, in a research note in February, said that growing consumer awareness — which still remained low — as well as strong growth abroad allowed room for growth.


Challenges for Yeti stock, they said, included drawing in new customers and entering new product categories. And Yeti's products were so durable, they said, that customers might not need to buy new ones so frequently.

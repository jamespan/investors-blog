**STMicroelectronics** ([STM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the European chipmaker holds up well amid the recent sell-off in tech stocks. STM stock has formed a flat base pattern.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), STM stock rose 1.6% to 49.12.


Over the past seven weeks, STM stock has formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 52.25, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. It has been looking for support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) during the current market turmoil.


If STM stock gets above Monday's high of 50.24, it would signal an early entry for aggressive investors, based on [IBD trading criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/). At that point, it will have cleared short-term resistance.

Chips For Electric Vehicles A Key Sales Driver
----------------------------------------------


Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay named STM stock as one of his favorite semiconductor stocks for 2022 in a Dec. 12 note to clients.


Geneva-based STMicroelectronics should benefit from "accelerating content growth" in electric vehicles, he said. Other beneficiaries of the trend include **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) and **Wolfspeed** ([WOLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOLF)), Ramsay said.


"We believe the automotive industry is going through the most dramatic transformation in its history, driven by the simultaneous disruptive forces of electrification and intelligence/autonomy," Ramsay said. "Our Best Idea for 2022 is the accelerating content growth opportunity for power semiconductors in the drivetrains of tomorrow's electric vehicles."


STMicroelectronics supplies chips to **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and other automakers.

[**Nvidia**](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/) ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the graphics-chip maker continues to dominate conversations about cloud service provider investments in artificial intelligence. Also, NVDA stock cleared a short consolidation on Monday.




In morning trades on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), NVDA stock popped out of a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 281.20, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. Nvidia jumped 4.2% to close at 289.10.


With Nvidia's positive move Monday, investors could start a small position or add to an existing position in NVDA stock.


However, if the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) fails, investors should use the stock's April 25 low of 262.25 as an exit point. That exit also would be below the stock's [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), a key support level.


NVDA stock has been surging this year as investors take note of the company's key position in providing [technology for artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvda-stock-nvidia-artificial-intelligence-strategy-impresses-analysts/). Year to date, Nvidia shares are up 97.8%.


NVDA Stock Called 'Top Pick'
----------------------------


Earlier Monday, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann named Nvidia as one of seven semiconductor stocks likely to benefit from the surge in spending by tech companies around artificial intelligence. Nvidia sells graphics processing units, accelerators, software tools and other offerings for AI projects.


"The compute requirements for the next phase in AI is massive and with no end in sight," Mosesmann said in a note to clients. "Today's training of large AI models is easily a $100 million-plus proposition."


Mosesmann rates NVDA stock as buy with a price target of 320.


Also on Monday, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse called Nvidia a "top pick" in a note to clients.

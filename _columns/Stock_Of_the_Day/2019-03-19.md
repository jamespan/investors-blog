Columbia Sportswear stock currently holds the top spot in the competitive Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group, which is No. 27 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Columbia is now sitting above the likes of rival **VF Corp.** ([VFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VFC)) (whose brands include Timberland and North Face), **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)), **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) and **PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)).


The stock holds a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 97. And while earnings haven't been screaming higher, growth has been steady.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-columbia-sportswear-co-colm.aspx) shows earnings have been growing at a 20% rate over the past three years. Sales growth has been less impressive, coming in at 5% over the same period. Columbia Sportswear stock has been performing well on the stock market, which is why it has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength3) of 91.


The firm has been outpacing Wall Street expectations. It has beaten consensus views for eight straight quarters on the top line and for 24 straight on the bottom line..

**MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it continues to show strength amid an ongoing market correction, even closing in on a new entry.




Once known as Morgan Stanley Capital International, the firm provides investment decision support tools. These include indexes, portfolio construction and risk management products as well as environmental, social and governance research and ratings.


MSCI is behind several closely watched indexes, including the MSCI BRIC, MSCI World and MSCI EAFE Indexes. The EAFE index measures the equity performance of developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada, with constituents including Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Hong Kong. The firm announced in 2017 that it would gradually add mainland Chinese shares to its emerging markets index, and they now make up 33% of the index.


A strong earner, MSCI generated operating revenue of $1.43 billion in 2018. The firm operates under three segments, with its index and analytics segments generating more than 90% of revenue.

MSCI stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is approaching a new high, while the stock itself is just 2% off its highs even as the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/what-is-the-stock-market-how-does-the-stock-market-work/) struggles.


The firm is a moderate grower that tends to do well compared to the market overall. It has performed especially well in the last six years. The firm's shares have managed to outperform the broader industry so far in 2019.


MSCI stock boasts a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 97, which puts it in the top 3% of stocks tracked. Earnings accelerated in the last quarter. And while the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-m-s-c-i-inc-msci.aspx) shows that average EPS growth of 22% over the last three quarters is a few points shy of the 25% desired by CAN SLIM investors, its three-year growth rate is 32%.


Sales growth has slowed, but is expected to pick up in both the third and fourth quarters.



Putting The I In CAN SLIM
-------------------------


[CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) are always on the lookout for stocks with strong investment from big money backers. This is why the I in the acronym stands for Institutional Sponsorship.


While the total number of shares institutions are holding has dipped in the most recent quarter, the number of funds that are buying has seen a slight net gain. Most notably, the highly rated Fidelity Magellan and T. Rowe Price New Horizons funds have both increased their positions.


In total, almost 43% of MSCI stock is currently held by institutional shareholders. The Vanguard Group has the biggest stake, with 10.5% of shares, while Fidelity comes next with 5.4%. Other big holders include BlackRock and T. Rowe Price.


Legendary stock trader William J. O'Neil, who founded Investor's Business Daily, believes institutional sponsorship is a key component of a winning stock.


"Buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters," he wrote in his classic tome [How To Make Money In Stocks](https://www.amazon.com/Money-Stocks-Complete-Investing-System/dp/0071752110/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3NYGZM6M3Z4V6&keywords=how+to+make+money+in+stocks+william+o%27neil&qid=1558455463&s=books&sprefix=How+to+Make+Money+in+Stocks%2Cstripbooks%2C198&sr=1-4).

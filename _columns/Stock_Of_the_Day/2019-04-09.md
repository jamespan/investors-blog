**Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the supplier to the **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) F-35 stealth fighter enjoys strong earnings growth amid robust defense spending. Mercury Systems stock is closing in on a new buy point.




Rising and shifting Pentagon spending should benefit Mercury Systems, which is a supplier to **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)) as well as Lockheed Martin. The Trump administration seeks to hike next year's defense budget by 5% to counter growing threats from abroad. The U.S. is shifting its focus to near-peer adversaries like Russia and China. That raises demand for high-end weapons systems.


Mercury Systems Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------------


Shares fell 1.3% to 64.96 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Lockheed stock and other key suppliers fell after [Japan grounded its F-35 jets](https://www.investors.com/news/lockheed-f35-japan-grounding-operational-squadron/) after one went missing.


Mercury Systems stock is working on a 67.95 buy point from a short [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), as part of a base-on-base formation, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Mercury Systems stock has more than doubled from its May 7 low of 30.11 to its Feb. 21 peak of 67.85.


After a strong prior uptrend, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is consolidating near record highs as Mercury Systems stock works on its base. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



Mercury Systems is trading above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), a key technical benchmark. And its 50-day line is well clear of the 200-day.


Mercury Systems Earnings Strong
-------------------------------


While sometimes uneven, the Pentagon contractor has been posting strong [sales and earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/in-can-slim-quarterly-earnings-are-most-important/) of late. Mercury Systems earnings shot up 68% in the latest quarter, with revenue rising 35%.


That last Mercury earnings report sent shares soaring 15% on Jan. 30, blasting out of a consolidation going back four months.


The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-mercury-systems-inc-mrcy.aspx) shows Mercury Systems earnings are strong, growing by an average of 40% over the past three quarters. In addition the three-year EPS growth rate of 21% is also very good, though not ideal for [CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).

The company has been growing by executing an acquisition-led strategy. This has been paying off so far, with Wall Street analysts revising earnings estimates higher.


Mercury Systems stock boasts a 98 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) out of a best-possible 99, reflecting earnings and various fundamental and technical factors. It's tied for first place in the competitive [Aerospace/Defense Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-08-2019/).


Budget A Boon For Mercury Systems Stock
---------------------------------------


Michael Ciarmoli, a senior research analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, wrote in a March 12 note that the 2020 budget request was "broadly supportive of our small to midcap defense coverage." He has a buy rating on Mercury Systems stock and a 63 price target.


The 2020 budget request did see a drop in the number of F-35 jets as well as KC-46 tankers, another plane for which Mercury builds parts. But David Williams, a senior equity research analyst at Drexel Hamilton, said that he doesn't see any specific program risk for Mercury even with the slight decline in orders.


"The (2020 Pentagon) budget is aligned to where their growth is coming from," Williams said of Mercury.


Mercury Systems bought GECO Avionics for $36.5 million during its fiscal second quarter. That was its fifth acquisition in the command and control market over the past two fiscal years. GECO Avionics has components in the Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter and the Boeing KC-46 refueling tanker.


Prior acquisitions include: Germane Systems in July 2018, Themis Computer in February 2018, Richland Technologies in July 2017 and Delta Microwave in April 2017.


In addition to supplying parts for the Lockheed F-35 and various Boeing aircraft, Mercury Systems is a subcontractor on Raytheon's Patriot missile defense system.


Late Tuesday, Mercury said it would offer an **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC))-based hardened security product with Lockheed for the defense and aerospace sector.

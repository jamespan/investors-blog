**Freshpet** ([FRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRPT)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) member advances above an official buy point amid a 26% surge since hitting recent lows in early August.


The Bedminster, N.J.-based pet food specialist boasts steam-cooked, grain-free and antioxidant-rich meals for canines as well as cats. Freshpet exclusively focuses on "fresh" pet food made with fresh meat, vegetables and fruits. Its products naturally carry a premium vs. the mostly "shelf stable" products from its more mature rivals, though some are starting to encroach on the fresh pet food market.




On Aug. 5, Freshpet pared its second-quarter net losses to $1.7 million from $17 million a year ago. That followed a surprise profit of $18.6 million in the first quarter vs. expectations for a $10.6 million loss. In both quarters, the company saw margins expand and hiked its full-year outlook.


The company is expected to turn profitable this year with earnings of 73 cents per share, according to FactSet. Profits are expected to jump 80% in 2025.


The company's rivals include **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)), **Nestle** ([NSRGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSRGY)) and **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)). Those packaged-food giants own the Blue Buffalo, Purina and Milk-Bone pet food brands, respectively.

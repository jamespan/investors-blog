**TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), the parent company behind T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Wednesday. TJX stock flirted with an early buy point after [beating first-quarter earnings forecasts Wednesday morning](https://www.investors.com/news/tjx-earnings-tjx-stock-bed-bath-beyond-opportunity/).




Earnings Beat
-------------


TJX earnings rose to 76 cents per share, leaping 55% from its diluted earnings of 49 cents last year and up 12% from adjusted year-earlier EPS of 68 cents. Total revenue rose 3.3% to $11.78 billion.


Analysts polled by FactSet expected first-quarter TJX earnings to rise to 72 cents per share on 3.6% revenue growth to $11.82 billion.


Total comparable sales for TJX rose 3% from last year, led by a 5% increase at its Marmaxx stores — the name of the combined Marshalls and T.J. Maxx locations. TJX noted "very strong" sales for its apparel and accessories product categories. HomeGoods comparable sales retreated 7% for the quarter.


However, the company's outlook was underwhelming for analysts. For Q2, TJX sees earnings of 72-75 cents per share, short of FactSet forecasts of 79 cents. TJX sees full-year earnings of $3.49-$3.58 per share, which includes a 10 cent per share benefit from an extra week in the fiscal calendar. FactSet projects earnings of $3.53 per share, improving from $3.11 per share last year.


Still, consumers are prioritizing affordable options as inflation takes a bite out of their wallets, which [analysts think provides a boost to TJX](https://www.investors.com/news/tjx-earnings-tjx-stock-bed-bath-beyond-opportunity/). Traffic trends at discount stores improved in April, analysts noted. And there's a whole to fill in the market after Bed Bath & Beyond filed for bankruptcy on April 23, providing an opportunity for TJX and off-price rivals **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and **Burlington** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)).


TD Cowen raised its price target for TJX stock to 89 from 88 on May 12 and maintained its outperform rating on the shares.


TJX Stock
---------



TJX stock jumped as high as 81.32 soon after the open, reversed slightly lower to 77.36 before closing up 0.9% to 78.98 Wednesday. In the morning, shares cleared an early entry at 79.81, just above weeks of tight action and close to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


TJX stock has an official 83.23 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) for its 19-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). Aggressive investors could find TJX ranks second in the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories Group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). It only trails **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)). TJX shares have an 87 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines various technical indicators into one easy-to-read score. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is off highs from early January and it has an 88 [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).


Ross Stores reports Thursday with Burlington due next week.

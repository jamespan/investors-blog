Avient is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cyclical stock trends toward a buy zone on the strength of its Q4 earnings report and upbeat outlook.




**Avient** ([AVNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVNT)), based in Avon Lake, Ohio, changed its name from PolyOne last July, upon closing its $1.45 billion purchase of the plastics-pigment unit of Switzerland's Clariant.


The deal is ahead of schedule in generating cost savings, while Avient's focus on growth opportunities is paying off.


Avient Earnings
---------------


On Feb. 9, Avient reported fourth-quarter earnings per share swelled 53% from a year ago, as the company's second-half rebound from early-year coronavirus woes accelerated. M&A-fueled revenue surged 51% to $997 million.


Avient is being somewhat conservative with its outlook for 8% revenue growth for 2021. Management isn't counting on a repeat from Avient's 2020 lift driven by Covid demand related to N95 masks and other applications. The lack of Q4's typical seasonal softness also is being treated as an anomaly.


Yet here's the good news: Despite restrained revenue guidance, Avient expects adjusted EPS growth of 24%, driven by new business gains, merger synergies and economic recovery.


Avient's higher-growth, higher-margin business is "hitting its stride," Stifel analyst Vincent Anderson wrote in a Feb. 10 note. Stifel hiked cyclical stock Avient's price target to 54 from 42, while upgrading the stock to buy from hold.


Avient Stock Analysis
---------------------


Avient stock fell 0.1% to 44.97 on Tuesday, reversing lower as the broader market sold off. Intraday, AVNT stock hit 46.32, just below a 46.48 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from an eight-week consolidation, according to a [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool) analysis.


Joining in the recent rally for cyclical stocks, Avient's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the charts provided, is near a two-year high. That may indicate the stock is poised to continue its recent outperformance vs. the S&P 500.


The cyclical stock formerly known as PolyOne hasn't quite made it back to its January 2018 all-time high of 47.48, which came just before the global synchronized boom began to soften.


Avient has an excellent 95Â [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating combines several key fundamental and technical factors into a single score. IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.



Why Avient Is Worth A Look
--------------------------


Avient is having success penetrating growth markets, such as composites for outdoor, high-performance applications.


The company is an ESG stock, with a long-term focus on sustainability. Its barrier technologies improve the shelf-life of foods and medicines. Its lightweight materials can replace heavier metal and glass, improving transportation fuel efficiency. It also focuses on technologies to minimize wastewater and improve recyclability.


Avient has an eye out for further acquisitions. "We create a ton of cash," CEO Robert Patterson said on the Q4 earnings call. The company has "the balance sheet flexibility to invest in future innovation and M&A this year."

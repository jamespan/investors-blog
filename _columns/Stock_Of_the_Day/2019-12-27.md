Next Spotify Stock Catalysts: CES, Earnings
-------------------------------------------



Spotify leads the streaming music industry with 113 million paying subscribers worldwide, as of Sept. 30. It also has 141 million users of its advertising-supported service tier.


Its success has attracted a bunch of competitors. Spotify's top rival is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) with its Apple Music subscription service. Other competitors include e-commerce leader **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) YouTube Music, and **Sirius XM Holdings** ([SIRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIRI)), which also owns Pandora.


The next catalyst for Spotify stock could be [CES 2020](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ces-2020-news-top-stories-from-worlds-largest-consumer-tech-show/), which runs Jan. 7-10 in Las Vegas. Spotify and other streaming media services will have a major presence at the consumer technology trade show.


Later in January, Spotify is expected to post its fourth-quarter results. The company has not yet set a date for its quarterly report. Analysts expect the company to lose 48 cents a share on revenue of $2.1 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. In the year-earlier period, Spotify earned 41 cents a share on sales of $1.71 billion.


S&P Global Market Intelligence says its consensus of analyst estimates has Spotify losing 22 cents a share on sales of $2.11 billion in the December quarter.


Spotify Earnings A Drag On Fundamentals
---------------------------------------


Spotify stock has a decent [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 71 out of 99. But the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Where Spotify falls short is on earnings. The company has not been consistently profitable. It has an [IBD EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 66 out of 99.


A knock on streaming music companies is that it's tough for them to make a profit because of high royalty rates owed to music publishers.


Rivals like Amazon and Apple can operate their streaming music services at near break-even levels or even as loss leaders. As a "pure play" in the space, Spotify doesn't have that ability.

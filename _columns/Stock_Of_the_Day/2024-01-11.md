**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Thursday, as NFLX stock reclaims a previous buy point. Netflix stock jumped early Thursday after the streaming giant's advertising chief touted the growth of its advertising-supported plan.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Netflix stock climbed 2.9% to close at 492.23. Last year, NFLX stock gained 65%.


The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company has 247 million subscribers across 190 countries for its TV, films and gaming streaming services.

With the gains early Thursday, NFLX reclaimed a 482.70 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Further, the stock hit 503.41 intraday, its best level since January 2021. Shares also rebounded from the 21-day and 10-week lines while breaking a short downtrend.


Netflix Ad-Tier User Boom
-------------------------


Netflix now has more than 23 million monthly active users for its ad-supported subscription tier, the company's advertising president, Amy Reinhard, [told Variety](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/netflixs-ad-tier-23-million-monthly-users-1235868024/). As streaming [competition intensifies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/streaming-services-face-judgment-day-netflix-in-lonely-spot/), Reinhard's comments showed the company's new product is growing quickly. Netflix said in a blog post in November that the ad-supported service had [reached 15 million monthly active users](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/streaming-services-face-judgment-day-netflix-in-lonely-spot/).


The company launched the lower-cost option in November 2022, in a bid to [reinvigorate subscriber growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-analysts-cautious-about-ad-subsidized-service/) that had slowed that year.


Users can pay $6.99 per month for a Netflix plan that includes advertisements, compared with $15.49 per month for its standard plan.


"The thing we're really excited about is the engagement," Reinhard told Variety. She added that 85% of ad-support plan users are streaming for more than two hours per day.


Some Wall Street analysts took notice of the new numbers. Evercore ISI estimated in a client note that 23 million monthly active users would translate to 12 million to 15 million subscriptions. That suggests the ad-supported tier has reached roughly 5% of Netflix's global subscription base, the firm noted.


"Not a significant number yet, but if this growth cadence continues, Netflix may well reach 50 million monthly active users and close to 10% of its subscriptions base by the end of 2024," wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney. "Now we're talking real scale — which could catalyze more significant and permanent ad budget shift to Netflix."


In December, research firm [Insider Intelligence estimates](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/netflix-outpace-disney-ad-revenues-despite-discrepancy-time-spent) that Netflix's advertising revenue will climb from $684 million in 2023 to just over $1 billion in 2024 and $1.1 billion in 2025. Rival Disney+, meanwhile, will grow from $786 million in 2023 to $912 million in 2024, according to Insider Intelligence.


Netflix Earnings Watch
----------------------


The next test for Netflix stock comes later this month, when the company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 23. Analysts expect the streaming giant to post earnings of $2.21 per share on sales of $8.7 billion, according to FactSet. In the year-earlier period, Netflix earned 12 cents a share on sales of $7.85 billion.


Analysts are largely positive. Of the 50 analysts following NFLX stock, 58% hold a buy or equivalent rating, according to FactSet.


That percentage had dipped as low as 27% in 2022. That year, Netflix sank 51% amid concerns about slowing subscriber growth.


Netflix Stock: Technical Ratings

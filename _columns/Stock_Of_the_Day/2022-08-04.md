**Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker drives higher after its beat-and-raise earnings report. MPWR stock is approaching a buy point.




Late Monday, the Kirkland, Wash.-based company trounced analyst estimates for the [second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mpwr-stock-monolithic-power-systems-trounces-q2-targets/) and pointed higher for the current period.

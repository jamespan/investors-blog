**Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as travel stocks benefit from the improved outlook by airline companies. Expedia stock edged down during afternoon trading on Thursday.




The stock has formed a [cup with handle,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a buy point of 204.08, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Expedia stock dropped 1.3% to close at 183.39 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Last week, shares popped 6.5% to 191.55, and it reclaimed its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Expedia is one of the largest online-travel booking companies globally. Its brands include Hotels.com, Vrbo, Trivago, Orbitz and Travelocity.


Expedia's main rival is **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)). Booking brands include Priceline.com, Agoda.com, Kayak, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable.


Expedia Stock Lifted By Airlines
--------------------------------


The improved performance in Expedia stock comes as airline and travel stocks have jumped on guidance from **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)), **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)).


United and American soared this week after both predicted booming travel demand despite first-quarter losses. United said it expects to return to profitability in the second quarter and full year despite surging fuel costs, even as its first-quarter results missed expectations.


Also on Tuesday, Delta offered up first-quarter revenue forecasts that were better than their earlier expectations.


"In the period following the peak in Covid-19 case counts associated with the omicron variant in January 2022, demand for travel has exceeded the company's previous expectations," United said in a regulatory filing.


Travel Stocks Breaking Out
--------------------------


While Expedia stock tried to break out Thursday, other travel stocks managed to push through this week.


These include **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) and **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)). The positive forecasts arrive some two years after the pandemic left U.S. airline industry and travel industry stocks reeling from steep losses.


Travel was one of the earliest and [most harshly affected sectors](https://www.investors.com/news/travel-stocks-airlines-cruises-hotels-omicron-labor-shortages/) in the coronavirus pandemic. Even with some uncertainty around omicron, people are ready to travel again.


Expedia Earnings Beat Estimates
-------------------------------


The evidence also was in the [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/airbnb-stock-jumps-ahead-of-fourth-quarter-earnings/) in late February that blew past Wall Street estimates.


Expedia said that gross bookings soared 131% to $17.5 billion from the year-ago period. Total revenue jumped 148% to $2.28 billion, driven by a strong recovery across all of its lines of business. In addition, adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share compared with a loss of $2.64 in the 2020 quarter.


Expedia stock is currently trading right about where it started the year. Meanwhile, Expedia reports first-quarter results on May 2.


As travel bans are lifted, U.S. spending on travel is expected to jump 21% this year to $1.06 trillion. That's a sharp recovery from the 42% plunge in 2020, according to Tourism Economics and the U.S. Travel Association.


Expedia Stock: Working To Cut Costs
-----------------------------------


Expedia, like most other companies during the pandemic downturn, worked aggressively to [cut costs and streamline business operations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tech-stocks-hit-it-big-as-covid-sparked-digital-shift-continues-with-no-end-in-sight/).


It has an IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 89 out of 99. That means Expedia stock is outpacing 89% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Further, Expedia stock earns the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Leisure-Travel Booking industry group. It's followed by Booking Holdings and **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)).

**KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it gives investors another opportunity to buy shares in a leading light of the hot homebuilding sector.




KB Home stock has enjoyed strong momentum in 2020 and is already up almost 15%. And it looks like the entry-level-home specialist could make a constructive move higher due to a rosy environment for housing stocks.


CEO [Jeff Mezger told IBD last month](https://www.investors.com/news/lennar-earnings-kb-home-earnings-q4-2019/) that 2020 will be KB Home's "best year in 15 years." He cited healthy job growth, the strong economy, low interest rates, and high demand. Meanwhile, costs have come down and are holding steady heading into the new year.


"We're still well below average activity levels for a 40- to 50-year period and we're below because of a supply constraint," he said. "The industry isn't putting enough lots on the ground to catch up, so we're still in catch-up mode where you have strong demand and the industry is working hard to generate more supply. This is why I can see this running for a while."

KB Home Stock Makes Bullish Moves
---------------------------------


Shares closed up 1.9% at 39.47, the highest since 2007, on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). KB Home stock has edged just beyond the buy zone after breaking out from a 10-week flat base, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The ideal buy point is 37.50, and the [chase zone runs to 39.38](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chase-zone-allows-buy-past-entry/).


KB Home stock also broke recent resistance at 39.38. The past week and a half has also seen shares rebound sharply off a test at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) on Feb. 5. Taken together, those moves could be seen as another buy signal.


Among other bullish traits, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has been looking strong since late December. KB Home stock has an [IBD Composite Rating of 96,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) and the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-k-b-home-kbh.aspx) shows EPS has grown by an average of 47% over the past three years. This is well clear of the [25% growth sought by CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).



It should be noted that earnings growth has not been as strong of late, averaging 3% over the past three quarters. But it did spike by a very strong 36% in the most recent quarter, rebounding from the two previous quarters of decline.


Other leading housing stocks are also hovering around multiyear highs, including **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)). IBD's builder-residential/commercial industry group ranks 25 out of 197.


Constructive Market For Housing Stock
-------------------------------------


The environment has become more constructive for housing stocks. A dovish Fed and demand from millennials has given the housing market a boost in recent quarters.


CFRA Research's Ken Leon sees momentum in 2020 for the housing market. The strong economy is one reason why demand will be strong.


"The foundation for a strong housing market is driven by employment growth, higher household income and high consumer confidence levels," Leon told IBD recently. "We're also seeing the secular change to millennial households beginning to acquire their first homes."


Leon said that stocks of housing companies that moved quickly to shift from building more expensive move-up properties to entry-level homes are benefiting from that secular trend. This is a specialty of KB Home.

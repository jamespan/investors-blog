**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the discount retailer shaping a [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) as earnings growth improves. Dollar General stock edged higher Thursday in light volume amid the holiday week.




Stock Of The Day
----------------


[Dollar General stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dollar-general-corp-dg.aspx)Â rose 5 cents to 98.15 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). That is 3% below a handle buy point of 101.28. That entry coincides with prior resistance around the 101 area, which Dollar General hit in the middle of April.


The buy point is within a larger consolidation that began in late January. Dollar General stock is now trading some 7% below that high.


The formation of a handle is a positive development. It offers a final chance for weak holders to get out, making it easier for the stock to blast higher. That quality makes patterns with handles some of the most successful breakouts.

If the Stock Of The Day breaks out over the handle entry, look for strong volume as that indicates institutional support.


Dollar General Stock
--------------------


Dollar General earns an IBD Composite Rating of 89 out of 99. That means its shares outperform 89% of all stocks based on key fundamental and technical metrics like earnings and sales growth, return on equity and price performance.


With the formation of the handle, which should be downward-sloping as the stock pulls back, the relative strength line is off highs. The relative strength line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. And if the line is trending higher, that's bullish.


As the IBD Stock Of The Day looks to clear the buy point, the RS line at a new high would be a positive indicator.

**Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Lockheed Martin stock cleared an additional buy point Tuesday. Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin have been outperforming the broader stock market, including fellow defense stocks **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)), **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)), **Aerojet Rocketdyne** ([AJRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AJRD)) and **Hexcel** ([HXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HXL)).




Raytheon stock, Northrop stock, Aerojet Rocketdyne stock and Hexcel stock are also near buy points. Meanwhile, **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) has fallen below a recently cleared buy point while Dow Jones giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) continues to struggle over its 737 Max woes.


Among [other top defense stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/defense-stocks-lockheed-martin-raytheon-buy-points-dow-jones-selloff/), **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), **L-3 Technologies** ([LLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLL)) and **Kratos Defense & Security Solutions** ([KTOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KTOS)) have surged to new highs.


Analysts see aerospace and defense stocks as a broadly defensive play in down markets, with less exposure than other industrial names to trade war and tariff concerns.

Lockheed Martin Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------------


Shares gained 1.4% to 349.35 in above-average volume on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), clearing a 344.90 buy point from a [four-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/).


A four-weeks tight, a longer variant of the three-weeks tight, is when a stock trades tightly over several weeks, usually after a prior breakout. Daily swings can be large, but the stock's weekly close must be within 1% to 1.5% of the prior week's close for three straight weeks. It's easier to see on a weekly chart, with tight patterns identified by [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).



The buy point is 10 cents above the high point of the tight pattern, not necessarily the left side of the pattern like a traditional base. Tight patterns offer a chance for existing holders to add a few more shares. Aggressive investors in healthy markets might see the 344.90 entry as a chance for a new position, given its handle-like formation just below the high of a broader consolidation going back to early October.


However, investors should hold off on buying during the stock market correction. Investors should build their watch lists and await a confirmed stock market uptrend.


Lockheed Martin stock already cleared a [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-cup-with-handle/) in mid-April, then gapped out of the buy zone a few days later on strong earnings.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) for Lockheed stock has been rallying for nearly two months, trading at a 13-month high.


Lockheed Earnings Growth Improves
---------------------------------


Lockheed stock has seen its [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) improve to an unbeatable 99 from 77 six weeks ago. While [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-american-express-co-axp.aspx) shows that Lockheed's earnings growth averaged a less-than-ideal 21% over the past three years, it has been at least 30% in each of the past five quarters. [Lockheed earnings and revenue growth crushed estimates](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/lockheed-earnings-defense-stocks-northrop-grumman-general-dynamics-raytheon/) April 23 and it raised full-year guidance.


Analysts see Lockheed Martin earnings growth slowing to 13% in 2019, then rebounding to 21% in 2020. That's short of the [25% minimum preferred by CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), but solid for a large, mature defense company.


Lockheed Martin Operations
--------------------------


Aerospace titan Lockheed operates in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems (which includes helicopters and early-warning radar) and Space.


Its aeronautics segment, the largest, accounts for 40% of revenue. Its largest program and biggest moneymaker is the F-35 stealth fighter jet.


The defense contractor recently issued a [bullish forecast for F-35 sales](https://www.investors.com/news/f-35-sales-estimate-4600-jets-lockheed-martin/).


Skunk Works, its program for future, next-gen aerial systems, is being closely watched. Lockheed's also taking a leadership role in [innovations such as hypersonic strike weapons](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/annual-reports/2018-annual-report.pdf), laser weapons systems, autonomy and artificial intelligence.


In April last year, the U.S. Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth up to $928 million to develop a Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon — a new air-launched missile that will travel more than five times faster than the speed of sound to tackle enemy defenses.


Defense Stocks Faring Well
--------------------------


The [Aerospace-Defense](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-may-31-2019/) group is rated No 16 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.


While Lockheed Martin stock is doing well, peers Kratos, L-3 and Heico stocks have been even stronger.


Northrop stock rose 1.7% to 312.27 on Tuesday. Northrop stock has a 317.60 handle buy point on a consolidation that goes back to early October or April 2018.


Raytheon stock advanced 1.6% to 179.06. It has a 188.90 buy point in a short [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) within a long consolidation. However, Raytheon stock has been trading below its 200-day line for most of the flat base.


[Boeing stock](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-737-defect-found-boeing-737-max-order-canceled/), which leads by market cap, remains stuck below its 50-day line amid 737 Max woes.

**Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as a bullish demand outlook and growth initiatives boost the Fort Wayne, Ind., steelmaker and its peers. STLD stock has a particularly timely setup, rising past a buy point from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) on Thursday.




IBD's [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) portfolio, focused on applying the rules of IBD's [CAN SLIM investing system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) to take advantage of short-term stock market trends, added STLD stock on Thursday.


Thursday's move by Steel Dynamics comes as **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)), the biggest steelmaker outside China, posted better-than-expected results late Wednesday and boosted forecasts for the steel global demand outlook.


The steel industry group also may be getting a lift from progress on a $1.2-trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal that cleared a key Senate hurdle on Wednesday.


**U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)), **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) and **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) also joined in the rally. Other industrial materials stocks also shone. Iron ore and copper stocks including **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)), **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) and **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) also advanced to or near early entry points. **Vale** ([VALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VALE)) stock dipped, just shy of an official buy point, after surging earnings apparently came up short.

STLD Stock
----------


STLD stock jumped 5.5% to 64.65, clearing a 63.28 buy point from a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool). The move, which included a gap higher, came on above-average volume.


While the seven-week base is fairly short, STLD stock's consolidation really began a month earlier. Steel Dynamics' relative strength line, which tracks progress vs. the S&P 500, has come off its highs amid the stock market's recent rotation to growth stocks.



However, its vitals look robust. STLD stock is a leader in one of the stock market's strongest group. [Steel-Producers](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-steel-dynamics-inc-stld.aspx) are ranked No. 7 among 197 industry groups, based on stock performance and momentum. Steel Dynamics has a stellar 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a single score factoring in both fundamental and technical strengths.


STLD stock has raced up from the bottom following strong Q2 results on July 19.


Steel Dynamics reported EPS surged 623% with revenue spiking 113% to $4.47 billion. The company sees strong demand lasting.


Steel Dynamics also provided a bullish update on its Sinton, Texas, flat rolled steel mill investment. Despite a weather delay, production should begin to ramp in the fourth quarter and add about $500 million in EBITDA in 2023.


ArcelorMittal, Other Steel Stocks Rally
---------------------------------------


Late Wednesday, ArcelorMittal reported Q2 EPS of $3.47 vs. a year ago loss and estimates of $2.70. Revenue rose 76% to $19.3 billion. The company said its results were the best since 2008, partly due to the end of export subsidies from China, which has stopped creating a global steel glut.


ArcelorMittal said it now expects global steel consumption to rise 7.5%-8.5% this year, boosting its forecast range from 4.5%-5.5%. The company hiked 2021 capex outlook to $3.2 billion from $2.9 billion, as it capitalizes on strong demand. Still, it launched a $2.2-billion share buyback after cashing in preferred shares of Cleveland-Cliffs, which bought its U.S. operations last year.


MT stock, the IBD Stock Of The Day on Tuesday, rose 2.45% to 35.13, striding further into a buy zone. On Wednesday, ArcelorMittal cleared a 34.06 buy point from a seven-week consolidation, according to MarketSmith.


Cleveland-Cliffs, the big U.S. iron ore and steel supplier, cleared a 24.87 buy point intraday, closing up 5.5% to 24.86. However, CLF stock looks extended from its 50-day line. Cleveland-Cliffs raced past an early entry point around 23.55 on Wednesday. CLF stock is part of the elite IBD 50 stock list.


On Wednesday, Cleveland-Cliffs said it had redeemed $1.2-billion worth of preferred stock held by ArcelorMittal. B. Riley analyst Louis Pipes said the transaction's favorable terms added $1.50-per-share in value to CLF stock, which he called "grossly undervalued."


Last week, Cleveland-Cliffs reported booming quarterly earnings.


Meanwhile, U.S. Steel and Nucor both broke clear of their 50-day lines on Thursday. U.S. Steel stock rose 3.75% to 25.47, clearing an early entry point around 25.38. Nucor climbed 4.1% to 103.45.

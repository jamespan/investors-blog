[IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is nearing a buy point despite the stock market correction, and its third-quarter earnings Wednesday could be a catalyst for a breakout.







Analysts expect Q3 EPS to jump 33.5% to $4.30, as revenue grows 6.5% to $2.49 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.


The Missouri-based auto parts retailer boasts a five-year earnings growth rate of 20%, along with a steady five-year sales growth rate of 8%. Its edge over rivals comes from a vast distribution network, spanning 27 distribution centers and 331 hub stores.


Morgan Stanley analysts call O'Reilly a "best-in-class operator," saying in an August note that its "omni-channel evolution"  to give customers a seamless online and in-store experience is progressing well. Plus, O'Reilly's network of stores and nationwide presence add up to auto parts availability that is hard to beat, analysts say.


Last week, news that **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) will partner to create an online automotive specialty store seemed to rattle investors already wary about the stock market correction.


But strong earnings and higher guidance from **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) helped set the eight-member auto parts group aright.


Shares of O'Reilly rose 1.5% to 344.82 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), nearing a 351.75 buy point after a successful test of the 50-day moving average last week. O'Reilly's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance against the S&P 500, is eyeing new highs. And the stock also boasts an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 94.


But with the stock market correction weighing on the outlook, investors should be extremely cautious about making buys until the outlook shifts back to a confirmed uptrend.


In addition, buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. An [earnings options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/) can help investors cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter*.*

Auto Parts Sector Has Moat Against Amazon
-----------------------------------------


For auto parts retailers, three key drivers of industry success — miles driven, average vehicle age and unemployment rates — all look favorable for now.


On the flip side, Walmart and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) have muscled into the business of selling car batteries, tires and lubricants. But the threat from e-commerce and nontraditional auto parts retailers may be overblown, according to Moody's Investor Service.


"Same-day delivery (measured in minutes and hours instead of days) is one of the primary advantages of the three major auto parts retailers AutoZone, O'Reilly and Advance Auto," Moody's said in a note last week.


"We believe that the advantage of proprietary, fully-scaled nationwide same-day delivery capability, which is critical to maintaining relationships with independent garages, provides a significant 'competitive moat' against online competitors such as Amazon."

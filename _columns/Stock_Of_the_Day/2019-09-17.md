**Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the semiconductor equipment supplier climbs on expectations for an improving chip market. Entegris stock notched an all-time high on Tuesday.




The Billerica, Mass.-based company makes specialty chemicals, microcontamination control products and advanced materials handling systems used in manufacturing semiconductors and other high-tech gear.


On Sept. 11, Entegris stock broke out of a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 45.22. It surged to a record high of 47.83 in morning trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). At the close, shares rose 0.3% to 47.43. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Entegris stock has been hitting new highs in a bullish sign.


Entegris has had trouble holding on to its gains, though. Since the start of the year, it has cleared four [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/). But after the three earlier breakouts, the stock reversed and undercut those buy points. Yet the stock has managed to stair-step higher.

Entegris Signals Second-Half 2019 Rebound
-----------------------------------------


On July 25, Entegris reported [fiscal second-quarter results](http://investor.entegris.com/news-releases/news-release-details/entegris-reports-results-second-quarter-2019) that missed Wall Street's expectations. It earned an adjusted 39 cents a share, down 20% year over year, on sales of $379 million, down 1%, in the quarter ended June 29. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 43 cents on sales of $383 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.


It was the sixth consecutive quarter of decelerating earnings growth and the first decline in earnings since first quarter 2016. Sales growth has decelerated for four straight quarters.


But the company signaled an improving business climate.


"The second quarter was soft for the industry and was somewhat softer than anticipated for Entegris," Chief Executive Bertrand Loy said in a news release. "In spite of the pervasive uncertainty, we are seeing increased evidence that our business will be stronger in the second half of this year."


On a conference call with analysts, Loy said he believed the second quarter would be the bottom for Entegris in the current chip cycle.


Company Benefiting From Node Transitions
----------------------------------------



Entegris is seeing "great momentum" for its advanced solutions for making chips at smaller node sizes, particularly with logic and foundry customers. More chipmakers are shifting to node sizes of 10 nanometers, 7 nanometers and even 5 nanometers. Circuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter.


"While this has been the most challenging year the industry has faced in some time, Entegris has weathered the storm relatively well," Loy said.


Entegris stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, meaning it has outperformed 96% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks fourth out of 34 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-entegris-inc-entg.aspx).


Industry peers with better Composite Ratings include **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **Cabot Microelectronics** ([CCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCMP)).


The chip-gear stock group now ranks No. 13 out of 197 industry groups. It has been climbing on expectations for a recovery in the semiconductor market later this year.

**Coherus Biosciences** ([CHRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHRS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares of the biotech company flirt with a breakout on expectations for a strong third quarter.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Coherus stock climbed 2% to 22.53. The move came in strong [volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/). At one point, shares jumped more than 8%, surging past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 22.89 out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) that began forming in early July.


The [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) focuses on [biosimilars](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/blockbuster-drugs-biosimilars-hammer-pharma-companies-sales/), nearly [identical copies of biologic drugs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceuticals-and-biologics-differences/). Like [generics](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/generic-drug-makers-face-pricing-issues-unlike-other-pharma-companies/), biosimilars [tend to be less expensive](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/drug-prices-what-we-know-about-rising-prescription-prices/) than their branded counterparts. Collectively, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Coherus sales of $94 million in third quarter.


But Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed says Coherus could outdo that. As of August, the biotech company had 18% share of the market for pegfilgrastim, a bone marrow-stimulating drug that **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) sells as the branded drug Neulasta. Coherus makes a [biosimilar](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biosimilars-rival-biologics-amgen-abbvie-roche/) called Udenyca.

"Assuming September Udenyca absolute volumes are equal to August, and slightly decreasing net price implies the third quarter can come in at $135 million (vs. consensus of about $100 million)," he said in a note to clients.


Biosimilar Udenyca Takes On Amgen Drug
--------------------------------------


The Food and Drug Administration approved Udenyca in November 2018. The [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) is rapidly gaining share for its version of pegfilgrastim. As of August, prescription tracker Symphony Health indicated Udenyca had 18% share of its market, up 2% from July.


Interestingly, Coherus' 2% gain in August came from **Mylan**'s ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)) biosimilar, Fulphila. [Fulphila gained FDA approval](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-neulasta-biosimilars-mylan-fulphila/) in June 2018. Meanwhile, Amgen maintained 76% market share for its [branded drug, Neulasta](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mylan-amgen-neulasta-biosimilar-approved/), in August, Syed said.


By year-end, [Coherus expects its biosimilar](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/coherus-stock-enjoys-gain-biotech-company-dives-into-biosimilars/) to have 20% or more of the market. Cowen and Company analyst Ken Cacciatore says that can happen even if **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) subsidiary Sandoz gains approval for its biosimilar of Neulasta. The FDA is set to make a determination on Sandoz's drug in October.



He also noted Mylan appears to be suffering from capacity issues, evidenced by flattening Fulphila prescriptions over the last eight to 10 weeks. This could create even more room for three biosimilars on the market if Sandoz gains approval.


"The bottom line is that we continue to believe that Udenyca will have a nice trajectory toward $500 million in sales with or without additional competition," he said in his report to clients.


Profitability Is Key For This Biotech Company
---------------------------------------------


Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect Coherus to post $94 million in third quarter sales, which would rise 12.7% sequentially. Udenyca is currently the biotech company's only product. Coherus is also planning to launch a biosimilar of **AbbVie**'s ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) [inflammation drug Humira](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abbvie-arthritis-treatment-biosimilar-humira-sales/) in 2023.


The Street expects Coherus to remain profitable in the third quarter. Then, it calls for Coherus to earn 36 cents a share, on an adjusted basis. That would rise from 32 cents per share in the second quarter — the biotech company's first profitable period.


Continuing profitability could drive more shareholders to Coherus stock, Cowen's Cacciatore said.


"As there is a greater appreciation that Coherus is more than just Udenyca/Neulasta — but a company with a sustainable pipeline — we do believe that the shareholder base may indeed broaden and become more diverse," he said.


He has an outperform rating and 35 price target on Coherus stock. Mizuho's Syed rates the biotech company with a buy rating and a 43 price target.


Coherus Stock Is Highly Rated
-----------------------------


The biotech company is also highly rated, per Investor's Business Daily's standards. It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating measures a stock's 12-month performance. This puts Coherus stock in the top 3% of all stocks. In addition, Coherus stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 83. The CR is a 1-99 score of a stock's key technical and fundamental growth metrics. Coherus stock ranks in the top 17% of all stocks regardless of industry group.

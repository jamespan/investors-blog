**Azek Company** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) The non-wood decking and outdoor building supplier is nearing a buy point as homebuilding hits a nearly 15-year high. Azek stock rose Friday.




U.S. homebuilding hit a recent high last month, with housing starts jumping 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units. Economists polled by Reuters saw housing starts rising to 1.613 million units in March.


But as housing starts pick back up, prices for raw materials like lumber have skyrocketed.


Chicago-based Azek offers a sustainable solution for homebuilders and businesses. It supplies nonwood decking, trim and other outdoor supplies from recycled material for the residential and commercial markets.


Overall, the housing market has stood up well during the Covid-19 pandemic and homebuyers are facing a very competitive market as inventory fell to a record low earlier this year. The pandemic has skewed what homebuyers are looking for as many opt for larger houses with more amenities for enjoying the outdoors outside urban centers.


Both Azek and **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)), which vies with Azek in the residential market, are setting up potential buying opportunities.


More broadly, the overall housing sector is faring well, from homebuilders to home improvement chains and home furnishing retailers.


Azek Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares rose 2.4% to 48.61 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Azek stock is on the cusp of a 48.89 conventional buy point. Aggressive investors could have started an initial position at 46.55.

Azek stock is currently finding support and bouncing off its 10-week line after dipping below. Azek's drop below its 10-week line was in lower weekly volume while the rebound has been in higher volume, a sign of strength.


However, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is off recent highs, a sign of weakness. But it's moving higher in the past couple of tweeks.



Still, institutional investors are buying into Azek. Top funds like Fidelity Contrafund and Lord Abbett are major buyers and the stock has a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which shows more buying than selling institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

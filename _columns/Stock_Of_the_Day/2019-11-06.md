Insulet is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the diabetes treatment player smashed third-quarter estimates and topped its 50-day moving average.




Shares of **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) gapped up at the open and rose as much as 11.6% to a session high of 161.59 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Shares ended trading at 159.99, up 10.5%. Insulet stock had faced some short-term resistance at 158.11. The move on Wednesday offers an early entry for aggressive investors ahead of a conventional [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 169.08.


Insulet makes insulin pumps for [diabetes treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-device-companies-ignite-revolution-diabetes-treatment/), a growing market due to the increasing number of diabetes patients worldwide. In the [third quarter, Insulet delivered](http://investor.insulet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/insulet-reports-third-quarter-2019-revenue-192-million-increase) "a big revenue beat and guidance raise," UBS analyst Matthew Taylor said.


"Trends in the quarter remained encouraging as Insulet discussed benefits from market access, the pharmacy channel, outside U.S. direct sales and patients starting on DASH," he said. DASH is a [management system](https://www.myomnipod.com/DASH_Update) that hooks up with Insulet's insulin pumps.

Insulet Stock Gaps Up On Earnings
---------------------------------


For the [third quarter, Insulet earned](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insulet-podd-surpasses-q3-earnings-221510103.html) 9 cents per share, on an adjusted basis. That easily beat the average estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment research for Insulet earnings of 3 cents per share, which would have matched the year-earlier period.


[Revenue also jumped](http://investor.insulet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/insulet-reports-third-quarter-2019-revenue-192-million-increase) 27% to $192.1 million, topping estimates for $179 million. That was better than the diabetes treatment player's own prior outlook for $174 million to $181 million in third-quarter sales.


For the year, the company now expects $722 million to $733 million in sales, which would mark a 28%-29% rise year over year. That's well above analysts' forecast for $710 million in full-year sales. Of that, the best growth is expected to come from insulin pump sales abroad.


Growing Market In Diabetes Treatment
------------------------------------


Insulet is benefiting from an increasing number of patients whose bodies don't make insulin or those who are now resistant to it. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body control a type of blood sugar called glucose. Spikes in glucose can be dangerous for diabetics.


There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 typically presents in childhood and is due to a genetic defect. These patients need insulin to survive. Type 2 is usually diagnosed in adulthood. These patients can worsen to the point they also need insulin.



Insulin pumps are more common in type 1 diabetes treatment because parents can struggle to give their diabetic children multiple shots each day. But Insulet "also noted increasing interest from type 2 patients, especially from Medicare, another key positive," UBS' Taylor said.


Still, Taylor kept his neutral rating on Insulet stock.


Pharmacy Sales Are On The Rise
------------------------------


The diabetes treatment company also noted an increase in U.S. patients receiving their insulin pumps from the pharmacy, Canaccord Genuity analyst Kyle Rose said in a report.


"The pharmacy channel materially reduces the operating frictions of all stakeholders, positions Insulet better in a risk-sharing environment, and potentially reduces out-of-pocket costs for patients," he said.


Further, more patients are now using the DASH management system. This is comprised of the insulin pump — dubbed Omnipod — and a handheld device that wirelessly controls the pump. Rose noted that Insulet is giving away the handheld device.


"But management noted it expects annual revenues per patient to remain unaffected as pricing on (Omnipods) will increase slightly to recoup the costs," he said. Insulet expects this to lower 2019 sales by $4 million to $6 million.


Half of all insured patients now have commercial coverage for the DASH system.


Insulet Stock Has High Ratings
------------------------------


Insulet stock hit a low point for the year at 80.43 in April. Since then, shares have ramped up more than 98% as of Wednesday's close.


Canaccord's Rose has a hold rating on Insulet stock, but raised his price target to 150 from 145.


"We expected to see a solid quarter from Insulet in the third quarter, and that is exactly what we got," he said. "That said, we continue to think the risk/reward is balanced at these levels with shares up almost 100% year to date and trading at 11 times our 2020 sales estimate."


Insulet stock has an Investor's Business Daily [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92. This puts shares in the top 8% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Shares also have a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 96, a reflection of the stock's performance over the past 12 months. Insulet stock ranks in the top 4% of all stocks.

Epam Stock: Specialist In Digital Services
------------------------------------------


Epam provides custom software development and platform engineering services. It specializes in digital services, with customers adopting new technologies such as cloud computing or big data analytics.


One of Epam's clients is **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google's cloud computing services.


Also, the company has expanded into higher-margin consulting services through acquisitions.


"Some 18% of Epam revenue comes from the software and hi-tech vertical," said Epam stock analyst James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group in a recent note to clients. He added: "when layering in other tech-intensive industries such as business information and travel, we estimate over 50% of Epam revenue comes from hi-tech customers."


The company hires most of its computer software developers in Eastern Europe, with most of its offshore centers in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Hungary.


Dobkin Epam Chief Executive Since 2002
--------------------------------------


Arkadiy Dobkin has been Epam's chief executive since late 2002. Dobkin began his career in Belarus and Russia, where he worked at several software companies.


He co-founded Epam in 1993. Originally the company was called Effective Programming for America.


Epam gets about one-fifth of revenue from the travel and consumer sectors, which have been hard hit amid the coronavirus pandemic. Customers include airlines and hotels. Those sectors are expected to rebound as coronavirus vaccines are distributed.


Consumer-focused companies like **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)) also have been among clients. In addition, Epam also has a number of clients in the financial services industry, including European banks. Epam more recently has been targeting the life science, oil-and-gas and automotive industries.


Epam Stock: Hiring Slows Amid Coronavirus
-----------------------------------------


In the September quarter, Epam profit rose 19% to $1.65 per share. Further, revenue climbed 11% to $652.2 million. That topped consensus estimates for EPS of $1.47 on revenue of $642 million.


"The results likely reflect strong expense management in response to COVID as well as management being able to hold the line on pricing," said Jefferies analyst Surinder Thind in an October report.


In addition, the IBD Computer-Tech Services group that includes Epam stock has held up better than some amid the coronavirus pandemic. It [ranks No. 80 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-23-2020/) tracked by IBD.

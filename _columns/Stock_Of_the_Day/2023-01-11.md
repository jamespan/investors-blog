CELH stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the energy drink maker offers an early entry and works on a new base in a rising health and fitness drink market.




**Celsius Holdings** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) boasts triple-digit earnings and revenue gains. The Boca Raton, Fla.-based company nearly doubled its sales in most recent quarter, but delivered a big surprise loss. Analysts expect a return to annual profitability for 2023.


In the third quarter, [Celsius doubled its amount](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/celh-stock-celsius-holdings-hot-growth-streak-could-disrupt-energy-drink-duopoly/) of product sold through **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). It also has a **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) distribution deal, while it continues to add stores that carry its products.


As CELH stock broke above a recent downtrend Wednesday, IBD added the energy drink maker to its [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) stock tracking portfolio. Celsius was also previously featured in a [Stock of the Day column](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/celh-stock-hot-market-energy-drinks-explosive-celsius-earnings-growth/) in December.

Celsius Holdings
----------------


[IBD's Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows that CELH stock earns a good-not-great 79 [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), out of a best-possible 99. It has a superior [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98 out of 99.


Its [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) is an underwhelming 24 due to recent earnings challenges.


The FactSet analyst consensus rating on CELH stock is overweight, with a consensus price target of $118.70, representing 14% upside from Wednesday's price level.


At least some Wall Street analysts think it may not be long before Celsius disrupts the longtime energy drink duopoly between Red Bull and **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)).


CELH Stock
----------


Shares of Celsius Holdings popped 5.3% to 106.57 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), bouncing above the 50-day moving average. The rebound offers a follow-on entry into Celsius stock. At the same time, shares cut back above a down-sloping trendline. This also allows aggressive investors to plot a higher-risk early entry to the stock.


The energy-drink maker is on track to have a new base with 122.34 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) by the end of next week.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for CELH stock rallied for much of 2022, the [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows. That strength indicator has pulled back a bit from December highs. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming vs. the S&P 500.


The 97 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) means that CELH stock has outperformed 97% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.


Monster bears an RS Rating of 84 and PepsiCo carries a 76.


PepsiCo is investing in Celsius as part of a long-term distribution deal. The beverage giant also acquired Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion in 2020.


By some calculations, [Celsius is growing faster](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/celsius-ceo-embraces-wellness-in-his-brand-and-in-his-life/) than giants Red Bull, Monster Beverage and Rockstar in the $53 billion energy drink category.


Energy drinks are one of the fastest growing beverage segments outside of alcohol.


Celsius Earnings
----------------


Over the past three quarters, Celsius earnings growth went from 800% to 140% to the third quarter's drop into a loss, FactSet shows. Revenue surged between 98% and 167% over the same period.


In the latest September-ended quarter, Celsius lost $2.46 per share vs. expectations for EPS of 10 cents. Results were hurt by a $155.4 million sales-and-marketing expense, a Q3 earnings release said.


That deep loss reflects a one-time charge as the company terminated existing distribution arrangements, while transitioning to PepsiCo's distribution system in the final quarter of 2022.


Celsius will replace the Bang brand drinks as the "exclusive healthy functional energy drink" in the PepsiCo portfolio for 24 months, Celsius executives said in August.


Analysts polled by FactSet predict Celsius earnings per share will rebound to $1.14 in 2023 from a loss of $2.42 in 2022. Revenue growth is seen slowing from 109% in 2022 to a still-impressive 51% in 2023.


In the past year, CELH stock surged 93% vs. a 16.4% decline for the S&P 500 index. Celsius stock is up nearly 33% from an early November low.

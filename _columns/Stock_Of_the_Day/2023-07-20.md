**Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) stock is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares bounded above their 50-day line within a flat base, giving investors a new entry.




In afternoon trades on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Novo shares jumped 2.65% to 164.48. Shares generally have trended higher this year on enthusiasm for Novo's efforts in weight-loss drugs.


Though the official [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is 172.97, shares of the pharmaceutical giant definitively retook their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since May, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Novo Nordisk stock also popped above its Monday high point at 161.85 as the stock rose above a trendline traced inside its [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/).


The move occurred on a relatively strong day for health care stocks. [**Johnson & Johnson**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-johnson-johnson-earnings-q2-2023/) ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and [**Abbott Laboratories**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/abbott-stock-abbott-earnings-q2-2023/) ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) popped on their second-quarter earnings beats. Shares of [**Eli Lilly**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/eli-lilly-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-breaks-out-with-tentpoles-in-two-key-markets/) ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), a key Novo rival, also extended a recent push, while [Tech Leader](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-tech-leaders-jul-19-2023/) **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) edged higher within a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).


Novo Nordisk Stock And Weight-Loss Drugs
----------------------------------------


Novo Nordisk sells two weight-loss drugs, Wegovy and Saxenda. It's also working on next-generation approaches to obesity treatment involving semaglutide. Semaglutide is the chemical behind Wegovy and Novo's diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus.


In May, Novo Nordisk unveiled the results of a once-daily, 50-milligram pill of semaglutide. Over 68 weeks, patients lost an average 17.4% of their body weight compared with a 1.8% weight loss for placebo recipients. More than 89% of patients lost at least 5% of their body weight compared with 24.5% of the placebo group, Novo Nordisk said.


The results bode well for Novo Nordisk stock and its future in [weight-loss drugs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/weight-loss-drugs-to-watch-rivals-ramp-up-to-unseat-the-undisputed-leaders/). Novo already sells a pill form of semaglutide called Rybelsus at 7- and 14-milligram dosages. But Rybelsus uptake has been slow. Pills could offer an alternative for patients wary of needles — Wegovy is an injection — but they must be timed out with food and water consumption to ensure proper absorption.


Novo is facing off with Eli Lilly in this segment. Lilly sells Mounjaro, a diabetes treatment that, in part, uses the same mechanism as Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus. Lilly is hoping the Food and Drug Administration will approve Mounjaro as a weight-loss drug later this year.


To stay competitive, Novo is also testing a combination using semaglutide and another drug that targets the hormone amylin. Amylin delays stomach emptying and decreases blood sugar. That drug, cagrisema, led to 16% weight loss over 32 weeks.


Diabetes Treatments Are Still Key
---------------------------------


Novo Nordisk stock analysts expect weight-loss drugs accounted for more than 18% of the company's second-quarter sales. Diabetes treatments Ozempic, Victoza and Rybelsus are expected to generate almost 60% of sales. It's important to note that diabetes treatments have widespread insurance coverage, while obesity treatments don't.


Overall, analysts call for adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share on $8.19 billion in sales. Earnings would grow 67.5% as sales surge almost 46% year over year. Novo is on deck to report its June-quarter sales on Aug. 10.


Bullishly, Novo Nordisk stock has a strong [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 94, putting its recent profitability in the top 6% of all stocks, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). Shares also have a strong 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which weighs a stock's fundamental and technical measures on a 1-99 scale.


The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is lower at 83, reflecting a recent pullback below the 50-day line. But Novo Nordisk stock was still up more than 18% year-to-date as of Wednesday's close.

**Ulta Beauty**'s ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) share price took a hit last year amid concerns of beauty market weakness, but the specialty beauty retailer's continued double-digit earnings growth seems to have bolstered investor confidence in the stock. That apparent beginning of a turnaround is giving Ulta [another appearance](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/kylie-cosmetics-kylie-jenner-ulta-beauty-stock-buy-zone/) as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




Strong Earnings Growth Lifts Ulta Beauty Stock
----------------------------------------------


The company clocked [34% profit growth](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-beauty-stock-buy-ulta-beauty-earnings/) in its most recently reported quarter, with earnings of $2.46, comfortably ahead of analyst estimates.


Revenue growth in Q2 rose 15%, a hair below estimates and the slowest rate in several years. Same-store sales growth — once in the teens but now in the mid- to high single digits — also disappointed.


But Ulta's earnings have been a consistent positive over the years: Quarterly profit growth hasn't dipped below 20% since 2014. And it was largely expected that comparable sales gains would moderate at some point.


Ulta Beauty Stock Has New Buy Point
-----------------------------------


Shares have since been on a nice run, up around 15% since its Q2 report, and well extended from a previous 260.60 entry point after breaking out from a flat base.


Investors can now look to the next buy point of 290.40 from a long cup-with-handle base. Ulta Beauty stock is still off its 314.86 record high from June 2017.


Shares rose 0.1% at 280.99 in the [stock market toda](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/)y, amid a broad market sell-off sparked by new U.S.-China trade-war fears and reports that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, will leave the Trump administration.


Ulta Beauty's relative strength line, which measures outperformance against the S&P 500, recently rose to a 12-month high, which earns the stock a Relative Strength Rating of 88.

The Kardashian Effect — This Time, Courtesy Of Kylie
----------------------------------------------------


Goldman Sachs and Conde Nast together named Ulta Beauty one of the top 10 "It Girl" brands in its annual love list.


"It Girls are more likely to shop at Ulta and Sephora, while mainstream women gravitate to purchases at Walmart, Amazon, and Target," noted the Goldman report.


The company is now enjoying the halo effect of no greater It Girl than Kylie Jenner herself.


Known to older millennials as Kim Kardashian's younger sister and to Forbes readers as a ["self-made" nearly billionaire](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2018/07/11/how-20-year-old-kylie-jenner-built-a-900-million-fortune-in-less-than-3-years/), Jenner announced during the last earnings call that her brand, Kylie Cosmetics, would be exclusively sold at Ulta, starting this holiday season.


The news sent Ulta Beauty stock higher, erasing any post-earnings nervousness about its results.


And despite concerns, the beauty sector as a whole seems to be doing just fine.


"Makeup continues to perform well, as our study found that more women are using it and they are also using more products, on average, in a typical day compared to two years ago," said Larissa Jensen, a beauty industry analyst at NPD Group in a July release. "At the same time, the consumer mindset today places greater emphasis on taking care of the skin in order to prevent flaws, rather than covering up flaws as they appear."


That shift in growth to skin care means that shoppers are still visiting beauty stores, which is good news for Ulta Beauty stock.


After the close, Ulta Beauty said Chairperson Charles Philippin will step down as of Sept. 30, citing medical issues. Robert DiRomualdo, a board member, will become chairperson. Ulta stock was little changed late.

**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker gains processor market share at the expense of industry leader **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). AMD stock is nearing a buy point ahead of its second-quarter earnings report.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMD stock dipped 0.6% to close at 90.26. It has formed a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 95.54, according to a weekly chart on [IBD's MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


AMD stock has been consolidating in a cup base for the past 26 weeks. However, aggressive investors could view AMD's chart as a double-bottom base with an entry point of 89.30. Even so, the handle offers a new entry in AMD's chart.


The next potential catalyst for AMD stock is the company's June-quarter earnings release, expected in late July.

Chipmaker Is Supply Constrained
-------------------------------


Raymond James analyst Chris Caso doesn't expect much from AMD's second-quarter report since the company is supply-constrained at its contract manufacturer. Foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) produces the chips that AMD designs.


"The potential for upside in the near term is much more dependent on the company's ability to secure incremental supply, rather than any changes in demand," Caso said in a note to clients Tuesday.


He rates AMD stock as outperform, or buy, for its long-term prospects.


Caso expects AMD to continue to take market share from Intel in central processing units for personal computers and servers. Intel has struggled with next-generation chips as evidenced by a recent delay in its new server chips.


AMD Stock Has Best-Possible Composite Rating
--------------------------------------------


Advanced Micro Devices has a mediocre [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 65 out of 99. The Relative Strength Rating shows how a stock's price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks. The best growth stocks typically have RS Ratings of at least 80.


However, AMD stock has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


In a positive sign, AMD has an [IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of B+. That indicates institutional buying of shares.


AMD stock is on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).

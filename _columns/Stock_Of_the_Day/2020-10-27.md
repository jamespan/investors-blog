**Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the China internet giant received a favorable ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals protecting its wildly popular WeChat app from an immediate ban on downloads. Tencent stock jumped.




On Monday, a three-judge panel for the appeals court rejected a Justice Department request to immediately ban **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google from offering Tencent's WeChat for downloads in U.S. app stores.


WeChat is a mobile app used for messaging, mobile payments and social media. It has 1.2 billion users, including 19 million users in the U.S.


Following the ruling, Tencent stock climbed 5.7% for a new closing high of 76.75 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), moving just above its buy range. Tencent stock is up about 58% this year.

Buy Point On Tencent Stock
--------------------------


During Tuesday's session, Tencent stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 73.05. The buy range extends to 76.70. An over-the-counter stock in the U.S., Tencent's main listing is on the Hong Kong exchange.



U.S. Commerce Department officials pursued the ban, which was initially set to take effect Sept. 20. It also sought to bar users from certain features in a move that could eventually make the app unusable in the United States.


The Justice Department argues that WeChat and Chinese short video sharing app TikTok threaten U.S. national security. In addition, the ban was supported by the Trump Administration with [two executive orders](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tiktok-ban-wechat-china-trade-war-elevates-orcl/) in early August. The lawsuit that sought to prevent the ban from taking place was filed by WeChat users.


Appeals court judges said the government had not demonstrated it would "suffer an imminent, irreparable injury during the pendency of this appeal, which is being expedited." The appeals court said the case will be placed on its January 2021 calendar.


Another concern is the ban could create problems for **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Alphabet and a host of other tech companies because it amplifies already high trade-war tensions between the U.S. and China that could reverberate across the technology landscape. Moreover, WeChat is a key element supporting Tencent stock.


China's Three Largest Internet Giants
-------------------------------------


Tencent is one of the largest internet companies in China, along with **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)).


Alibaba stock climbed 3.9%, near 318.88. Meanwhile, JD.com moved up 2%, near 83.


Fueled by its popular WeChat app, Tencent is China's leader in online messaging and payment services. It's also a leading provider of online gaming, and has a burgeoning business in cloud computing.


Tencent revenue has been growing at a steady double-digit pace. In its [second quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tencent-stock-second-quarter-earnings-results/) on Aug. 12, Tencent reported a 29% jump in revenue to $16.2 billion, slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates. That was its best growth in two years.


Adjusted earnings of 44 cents beat views of 41 cents. Tencent said online game revenue jumped 40% to $5.5 billion.

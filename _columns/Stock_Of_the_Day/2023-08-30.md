Dow Jones payments giant **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. Visa stock broke out for the third time since April as part of its 19% run-up this year.




Credit card giants Visa and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) are holding up even as [retailers caution of slowing consumer spending](https://www.investors.com/news/retailers-raise-red-flags-analysts-turn-cautious-amid-divergent-results-lululemon-dollar-tree-more-to-report/). Spikes in transaction volume and cross-border payments from the travel rebound [fueled earnings beats](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-mastercard-hover-in-buy-zones-ahead-of-earnings/) for both companies the past four quarters.


More broadly, the U.S. consumer has remained resilient in 2023.


For Q3 results in July, Visa reported 9% adjusted earnings growth to $2.16 per share on 12% revenue growth to $8.1 billion. Analysts expected earnings of $2.11 per share on $8.06 billion in revenue.


Payments volume increased 9% for the quarter while cross-border volume popped 17%.


Service fee revenues rose 15% to $3.66 billion, topping expectations of $3.63 billion. Data processing fees also rose 15% to $4.1 billion, beating FactSet estimates of a 10.8% gain. International transaction revenue swung 14% higher to $2.92 billion, but fell short of forecasts of $3.01 billion.


Elsewhere, Visa and Mastercard plan to raise fees that merchants pay when accepting customer credit cards, [the Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 30](https://www.wsj.com/finance/visa-mastercard-prepare-to-raise-credit-card-fees-ed779be1). The fee increases are scheduled to start in October and April, with many of the hikes for online purchases.


Unlike many other credit card companies, including **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Capitol One** ([COF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COF)), Visa and Mastercard don't carry card balances. Those are handled by issuer banks such as **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)).


Instead, the two payment giants make their money from processing fees.


Visa Stock
----------



Visa stock rose 0.5% to 246.50 on Wednesday, off session highs but nudging past a 245.37 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) for a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). The move marks Visa's third breakout since April. The flat base is just above a prior flat base, so this is a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) pattern.


Base-on-base patterns are especially bullish when the overall market is going sideways or struggling. While the market is now in a confirmed uptrend, the S&P 500 is still some distance below its 52-week high set in late July. As a result, the relative strength line for Visa stock has climbed over that span.


The most recent flat base settled more than 2% above 10-week support and shares are trading above their technical moving averages. The current [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/), which stretches 5% beyond the buy point, extends to 257.63.


V stock rallied nearly 19% in 2023 through Wednesday. Shares are approaching their record high of 252.67 from July 2021.


Visa stock has a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating combines various technical indicators into one easy-to-read score. Visa has a strong 90 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) based on its earnings track record. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) has fallen from its early January highs and it has an 83 [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).


Meanwhile, MA stock climbed 1% to 415.78. That's still in range of Mastercard's own flat base/base-on-base buy point of 405.19.

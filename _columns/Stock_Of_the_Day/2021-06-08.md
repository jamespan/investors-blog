**Olo** ([OLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLO)), the IBD Stock Of The Day, is a software developer that feasts on the booming market for food ordering and delivery. Olo stock recently has gone stratospheric.




As the saying goes, when you're hot, you're hot — and Olo stock is perhaps too hot to handle at the moment.


The recent initial public offering is widely extended, up 30%, from a 33.30 buy point from a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) that broke out eight trading days ago. Moreover, Olo stock is up in 16 of the last 17 trading days.


During afternoon action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Olo was up 2.7% to 43.06.

It's not a buy right now, but put it on your watchlist for the next setup. At some point big winners will pull back, such as in a market consolidation.


Top Mutual Funds Load Up On Olo Stock
-------------------------------------


The unusual strength of Olo stock is indicative of a great leader


That would help explain why some of the best-performing mutual funds have loaded up on Olo.


These include Lord Abbett Developing Growth ([LAGWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAGWX)), Janus Henderson Global ([JAGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAGTX)), Wells Fargo Emerging Growth ([WEMIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEMIX)) and Fidelity Growth ([FDGRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDGRX)).


Hungry consumers have multiple ways to order food. It can be done through apps from **Uber Eats** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) or **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)). It can also be done through a restaurant's website, a social media application, mobile applications and voice ordering by phone.


Working Behind The Scenes For Restaurants
-----------------------------------------


With Olo's software, restaurants can more easily manage these order and delivery platforms all on one platform and connect it with the company's point-of-sale system. The New York-based company provides a software-as-a-service platform that facilitates online ordering, pickup and delivery services. It processes about 1.8 million orders per day.


Building the software tools to streamline all of these platforms for a restaurant's point-of-sale system is not something many companies can do on their own. That helps explain why Olo provides so much value to these chains with dozens or even hundreds of locations. Olo, which stands for online ordering, works with more than 400 brands and 64,000 restaurants.


The Olo platform centers on strengthening and enhancing a restaurant's direct consumer relationships, according to the [Olo stock IPO filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1431695/000119312521049073/d867519ds1.htm#rom867519_12).


Users of the software include **Cheesecake Factory** ([CAKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAKE)), **Cracker Barrel** ([CBRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBRL)), **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) and **Denny's** ([DENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DENN)). In total, more than 64,000 restaurants use its software.


Keeping A Keen Eye On Olo Stock
-------------------------------


Investors have had a keen eye on Olo stock since [the time of its IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/olo-ipo-initital-public-offering-trades-wednesday-restaurant-software/) in March, which raised $450 million. Shares priced at $25, well above initial estimates in the range of $16 to $18. It popped 37% on the first day of trading, giving it a market valuation of $3.6 billion.


Olo has a track record of phenomenal growth. The total amount of dollars flowing through Olo's platform has nearly doubled in each of the last five years. In 2014, Olo surpassed $100 million in cumulative gross merchandise volume. In 2020, that number hit $14.6 billion.


And unlike other companies in the restaurant delivery sector, Olo is making a profit. In the first quarter, Olo reported a [125% jump in revenue](https://investors.olo.com/news/news-details/2021/Olo-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) to $36 million and a 4-cent profit. The company reported year-end revenue of $98.4 million in 2020, up 94% from the prior year. Also, it showed net income of $3.1 million, vs. a loss of $8.3 million a year ago.


Olo stock currently sports an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 77 and a Relative Strength Rating of 61.

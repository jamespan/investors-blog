Chicken-wing chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Wingstop stock is clearing a consolidation, after a long run higher as the coronavirus pandemic forced diners toward digital ordering and delivery — two businesses that analysts say Wingstop was built for.




Wingstop Stock
--------------


Wingstop stock jumped 9.2% to close at a new record high of 131.77 in the [stock market today,](https://investors.com/stock-market-today) breaking past a short consolidation with a 126.74 entry.


The stock's move higher on Friday also marks a strong bounce off support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), another bullish sign. As Wingstop stock consolidates, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) — a gauge of a stock's ability to stay ahead of the S&P 500 — has sagged since mid-May but spiked on Friday.


Shares have a 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and an 87 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). IBD encourages investors to focus on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s.


Northcoast on Friday kept its buy rating on Wingstop stock, citing the potential for continued digital sales gains through May, [according to The Fly](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3113539&headline=WING-Northcoast-reiterates-Buy-rating-on-Wingstop-after-compelling-checks).


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), another food delivery stock, edged up 0.8% to 378.41 on Friday. Shares were trying to clear a 387.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/).

Delivery Boost
--------------


Many full-service restaurants have clung to life as U.S. states, seeking to keep crowds out of enclosed spaces in an effort to halt the virus's spread, closed restaurants' dining rooms and left them with to-go orders only. But takeout and delivery orders [already comprised some 80% of Wingstop's sales](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/darden-restaurants-stock-wingstop-stock-coronavirus/) before the pandemic took hold in the U.S.


As with the broader market, Wingstop stock fell at the end of February, as worries deepened over the pandemic's impact on the economy. But shares began a long ascent in March, before cooling off in May.


Wingstop's fiscal first-quarter domestic same-store sales rose 9.9%. The company's fiscal first quarter, also reported in May, ended on March 28.


[CEO Charlie Morrison](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/wingstop-ceo-charlie-morrison-heats-up-success-simplicity/) said the second quarter was off to a "very strong start" in the company's first-quarter earnings release. April domestic same-store sales growth surpassed 30%, he added. Since the chain closed its dining rooms in mid-March, digital orders had made up nearly 65% of sales.


Consensus Might Be 'Missing' This Upside
----------------------------------------


Other analysts have also found reasons to like Wingstop stock.


Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, in a research note on Tuesday, said recent checks suggested May's same-store sales "ran steadily north" of April's. He also argued that current sales estimates for the company "are missing the sticky nature of digital sales."


However, he said there were "limited catalysts" for Wingstop stock beyond its quarterly earnings.


"We look for updates around menu promotions (and) digital initiatives, as well as the potential launch of chicken thighs," he said.

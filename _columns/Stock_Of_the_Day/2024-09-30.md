The Fed Rate Cut And Housing
----------------------------


The [Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/next-federal-reserve-meeting-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/) recently cut rates for the first time since the Covid crisis with Fed Chief Jerome Powell signaling more easing along with an economic soft landing.


For 2025, policymakers see another 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts, bringing the key rate down to a 3.25%-3.5% range.


Homebuilders for more than a year have said that housing affordability has been tested by interest rate movements. Many homebuilders have turned to incentives to keep home prices down and drum up demand amid increased interest rates. However, mortgage rates have fallen considerably over the past few months along with Treasury yields in anticipation of Fed rate cuts. That boosts affordability, so potential buyers may need fewer incentives to seal the deal, leading to higher profits for M/I Homes and others.

**Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) is Thursday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the aluminum play, which is benefiting from constrained industry capacity, leads a broad-based metals rally. AA stock cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/), but closed slightly below that level.




Metals stocks regained luster in the wake of Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting. While the Fed surprisingly penciled in three interest-rate hikes for 2022, policymakers offered a bullish view for strong near-term economic growth and a long expansion. That seemed to ease worries that high inflation could force the Fed to hike rates aggressively over the next few years, risking a potential recession.


Aluminum Price 'Inflection Point'
---------------------------------


Aluminum prices, though off their October peak, are up by about one-third over the past year. Alcoa has said that Chinese enforcement of curbs on aluminum smelting capacity this year to reduce carbon emissions represents an "inflection point" for the industry. The resulting higher prices have transformed the company's balance sheet.


Along with its Q3 earnings report, Alcoa announced a new 10-cent quarterly dividend and a $500-million buyback of AA stock.


The demand outlook for aluminum also looks favorable. "Aluminum is a big part of the solution of decarbonizing the world," Alcoa CFO William Oplinger said at a Goldman Sachs metals and mining conference on Nov. 17.


Thanks to its combination of light weight and strength, Oplinger estimated that the aluminum content of EVs is about 100 kilograms more than that of internal-combustion-engine vehicles.


"Aluminum is our favored commodity pick, with positive demand prospects for light-weighting and packaging, plus potentially severe limitations on supply," wrote Wolfe Research analyst Timna Tanners. She initiated coverage of AA stock with an outperform rating and 63 price target on Nov. 16.


She called 2021 a "breakout" year for the aluminum price. Given high energy costs in China and Europe, "we don't see it capitulating near term."


Tanners noted that restarts of mothballed Alcoa capacity are among the catalysts that could drive AA stock higher. In September, Alcoa announced that it would restart 268,000 metric tons of aluminum capacity at its Alumar smelter in Brazil. The ramp-up will begin in Q2 of next year. By 2024, the smelter will be powered by renewable energy.


AA Stock Analysis
-----------------


Shares rose 3.2% to 52.62 in Thursday's [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). AA stock jumped  as high as 54.15, briefly clearing a 52.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a double-bottom base, according to a [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool) analysis.


The buy point is 10 cents above the Nov. 12 midpoint of the [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/). The first leg of the base started after AA stock hit a three-year-high of 57.57 on Oct. 18.


AA stock has a 97 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) from IBD, meaning it has outperformed 97% of all stocks over the past year.


Thursday's move clearly came as part of a broader metals rally. On Wednesday, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) stock [dragged down the steel group](https://www.investors.com/news/nucor-stock-falls-near-buy-point-profit-warning/) after indicating that Q4 earnings should hit a record, but fall short of analyst estimates. But steel stocks closed well off their lows, joining in a post-Fed meeting rally. On Thursday, NUE stock rebounded 5.25%, **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) 6.1%, **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) 3.6%, and **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) 3.8%.


But U.S. Steel stock fell solidly late Thursday after the company gave disappointing guidance for the ongoing Q4. CLF stock and Nucor edged lower.


**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) climbed 2.8% on a bounce in the copper price, closing in on a cup-with-handle buy point.


While metals stocks rallied, the broader market generally retreated, with the Nasdaq tumbling more than 2%. That's a bad follow-up to Wednesday's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), which confirmed the new market rally

AA Stock Is An ESG Play
-----------------------


Alcoa said at its Nov. 9 investor day that it would only add aluminum capacity that is produced with zero carbon. For longer-term investors in AA stock, Alcoa is working on several green innovations that could pay off.


Alcoa has partnered with **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) in developing "no carbon smelting technology" that could see a commercial launch by 2024.


On a slightly longer time frame, Alcoa is working on converting post-consumer scrap into ultra-high-purity aluminum.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sotd-for-05-13-2019-desktop-2.png)Beyond Meat, the IBD Stock Of The Day, is leading a new trend in food with its plant-based burger patties and sausages. It hopes to expand its product offerings to include steak.






**Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is making an impressive gain amid a landslide in U.S. stock prices Monday. The new IPO is striving to form a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) that presents a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




The first base by a new initial public offering is called simply an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). Such a base can form in as short as seven trading days. But more commonly, successful bases can take at least five or six weeks to several months to complete.


At midday Monday, Beyond Meat sizzled as much as 8.7% higher to a session high of 71.96. At that price, the midcap growth stock traded an amazing 187% above its IPO price of $25 per share. Shares closed up 5% at 69.50 about 19% below an all-time peak of 85.45.


The stock has 59 million shares outstanding, a float of 33 million shares and a market value of just over $4 billion.


In a [narrow IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), you can spot the typical [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) by simply adding 10 cents to the base's left-side high. In this case, the [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) stands at 85.55. Certainly, the stock will need some time to get close to that price level before a potential breakout can take place.

IBD Stock Of The Day: Already Active On The Nasdaq
--------------------------------------------------


[On the breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), you like to see institutional investors rush into the stock with urgency. Good breakouts tend to see a sharp volume increase vs. the 50-day moving average. Monday serves as Day 8 of trading on the Nasdaq for Beyond Meat. So at this point, see if the daily turnover continues to shrink.


On its May 2 debut, 23.1 million shares exchanged hands. But during a three-day pullback through Friday, daily turnover averaged 8.6 million.


The El Segundo, Calif., company makes and sells frozen burgers and sausages that are engineered to simulate the texture and flavor of beef and pork. Yet rather than use animal sources, its products center on protein derived from vegetable peas. It also sells a product that is meant to replace chicken meat.


The company, incorporated in 2011, has yet to turn a profit. A big question for investors: Will Beyond Meat succeed in continuing to post sales that grow fast enough to exceed operating expenses and eventually deliver a tasty bottom line?



Beyond Meat: The Profit Challenge
---------------------------------


No doubt, the top line is growing at a delicious rate. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Beyond Meat sales soared 175% to $31.5 million, the highest in any quarter in the company's history. Over the prior four quarters, sales growth averaged 171%.


Gross profit margin in calendar 2018 was $17.6 million, or 20% of $87.9 million in sales. In 2016 and 2017, the cost of goods sold exceeded net revenue — meaning the company had no gross margin in each of those years.


R&D expenses last year jumped 68% to $9.6 million, or 10.9% of net sales. Selling, general and administrative costs more than doubled to $34.5 million.


Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv see the company losing 15 cents a share despite growing sales 213% to $40 million.


Beyond Meat's chief rival, for now, is likely Impossible Foods. Reuters has reported that the latest fundraising round for the latter has now bumped the total raised to more than $750 million.



Burger King, a unit of **Restaurant Brands** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR)), uses Impossible Foods beef-substitute patties. Entertainment celebrities R&B music mogul Jay-Z, former Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am, singer Katy Perry, NBA star player Paul George and others have reportedly invested in Impossible Foods.


David Lee, Impossible Foods' chief financial officer, told Reuters that the company is in no rush to go public for now.


Customers can order burgers and sausages made by Beyond Meat at stores in the Carl's Jr., TGI Fridays, A&W and Dog Haus restaurant chains.


On A Watch List For Top Stocks
------------------------------


Beyond Meat joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) as a watch list name. Through May 10, stocks making the Leaders List produced a 22.1% gain year to date on a portfolio-weighted basis vs. 14.1% for the S&P 500.


To determine performance of the Leaderboard stocks, a full position on the "Leaders Near A Buy Point" and "Leaders" lists takes up one-eighth the funds of an all-cash portfolio devoted to growth stocks; a half position takes up one-sixteenth.

Square is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the digital payment processor nears a new buy point while forming the handle on a cup-with-handle chart pattern. Investors should be wary of buying Square stock ahead of its second-quarter earnings report due Thursday.




Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile devices. With roots serving micromerchants such as farm-stand vendors, Square has moved "upmarket" targeting small businesses.


Its Square Capital division provides loans. In addition, Square provides software for point-of-sale systems and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.


Square stock is trading about 2.7% below an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 82.76. Shares ended Tuesday trading up fractionally to 80.49.

Square stock hit an all-time high of 101.50 last Oct. 1, concluding a big run that began in July 2016. Shares in Square corrected 50% through late December 2018. Not many stocks roar back after such a steep correction, but the major correction served to [reset Square's base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


Square Stock Claws Back From Steep Correction
---------------------------------------------


Square stock began forming a first-stage base in March. The consolidation left Square with a buy point at 82.76, below its all-time high. Square stock is forming a bullish [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/).


The IBD [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) on Square stock has improved to 81 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. In mid-June, Square's Relative Strength Rating lagged at 45.


Square has wrestled with finding the right balance between revenue growth, investments and profitability. New product development has crimped margin growth. And, costs to integrate acquired companies have taken a bite out of profits.


Square Earnings: What To Look For
---------------------------------


Heading into Square earnings on Thursday, analysts are eyeing organic growth for Square's subscription and services revenue.


This revenue comes from Square Capital, Instant Deposit, and the Square Cash app. Square Cash, a consumer digital money-transfer service, competes with **PayPal Holding**'s ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) Venmo.


Meanwhile, Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.


Another issue heading into earnings is the gross payment volume generated by merchant customers. "Strong U.S. consumer spend trends and **Visa**'s ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) recent earnings bode well for Square's second quarter GPV and transaction revenue growth," Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said in a recent note to clients.


"We continue to like Square's core business," added Faucette. "However, we believe that the market has incorrectly valued key earnings contributors like Square Capital and Instant Deposit."


Square Stock: Investments Crimp Profit Outlook
----------------------------------------------


Square in 2018 acquired Weebly, aiming to compete with **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) in setting up e-commerce websites for small businesses.


The fintech company has the same chief executive as **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) in Jack Dorsey.


In May, Square raised its 2019 sales outlook by $30 million to a range of $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion. Square 2020 revenue will grow nearly 35% to $3.07 billion, analysts estimate.


Analysts estimate 62% profit growth to 76 cents in 2019. Profit growth is expected to slow to 49%, or $1.13, in 2020 amid higher investments as Square builds a payments ecosystem.

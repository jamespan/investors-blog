**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the biotech company gained a key designation for its gene-editing drug. Now, VRTX stock is clearing an add-on entry point for investors.




Early Monday, the Food and Drug Administration granted Vertex and **Crispr Therapeutics**' ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)) gene-editing drug a regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation, or RMAT. The designation will expedite the development and review process of the blood-disease treatment.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), VRTX [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) popped 5% to 285.28. The news also sent Crispr stock flying 13.9%, near 61.30.


VRTX Stock Rises On Designation
-------------------------------


The biotech companies are partnered on a medicine called CTX001. The gene-editing drug is in testing as a treatment for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, both types of genetic blood diseases. Vertex and Crispr's drug is based on a type of gene editing known as CRISPR.

"RMAT designation is another important regulatory milestone for CTX001 and underscores the transformative potential of a CRISPR-based therapy for patients with severe (blood diseases)," Crispr Chief Executive Samarth Kulkarni said in a written statement.


Vertex needs to advance its pipeline, analysts say. In October, the biotech company gained FDA approval for Trikafta, a treatment for 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. Now, many patients have switched to Trikafta treatment.


"We believe de-risking of pipeline will be key for next potential value inflection," RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a recent report to clients. As of late April, he had a sector perform rating and 260 price target on VRTX stock.


Trikafta Performance Strong
---------------------------


Shares have performed well this year, with VRTX stock rising 24.1% as of Friday's close. The strong stock performance comes amid its launch of Trikafta. During the first quarter, Trikafta generated $895 million in sales, accounting for 59.1% of total sales.



JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko expects the Trikafta launch to be investors' primary focus in 2020. She notes Trikafta brought in nearly twice as much as analysts expected in the first quarter. Vertex also raised its outlook for 2020 following the bullish quarterly report.


Bayko boosted her price target on VRTX stock to 285 from 255. She kept her market outperform rating on shares.


Forming An Add-On Entry
-----------------------


Vertex stock ranks first in its industry group with a perfect [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 99. The CR is a 1-99 score of a stock's key fundamental and technical growth metrics. This puts VRTX stock in the top 1% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95. So, VRTX stock ranks in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.


On Monday, VRTX stock moved above a short consolidation with a bullish [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 277.90. This functions as an add-on position for those who bought VRTX stock after it emerged from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at 249.95 in early April. This is a chance for investors who already own Vertex shares to add a bit more of the stock, but too risky for a brand-new purchase of shares.

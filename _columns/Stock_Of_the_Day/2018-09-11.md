Transportation stock **XPO Logistics** ([XPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPO)) is extending gains after a breakout Monday, making it the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). XPO stock rose a fraction Tuesday, following a big move by the transportation sector in the prior session.




Transportation Sector
---------------------


With the [transportation sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-sep-10-2018/) leading stock market gains Monday, that's a good sign for the U.S. economy amid Trump trade war tensions. Collectively rising some 4.8% since the beginning of the year, the sector is far from a leading group. But it's had a robust rally since late June, with a recent run of individual breakouts. Continued strength could signal sector rotation.


When there are changes in the market, there are often changes in leading stocks and sectors. Becoming attuned to [sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/industry-group-strength-how-to-find-big-stock-winners-veeva-electronic-arts-alibaba/) is helpful in finding the next crop of stock market winners.


XPO Stock Action
----------------


XPO Logistics is a transportation and supply chain logistics company based in Greenwich, Conn. Monday's heavy-volume breakout lifted XPO stock past a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point of 108.71. Heavy volume when a stock clears a buy point is bullish.


After the IBD Stock of the Day broke out Monday, Stifel Nicolaus on Tuesday raised its price target on XPO stock to 126, representing a 12.5% premium to Monday's closing price.


XPO Logistics shares rose 0.2% to 112.27 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). XPO stock is still within the proper [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) from the 108.71 entry. The buy range prevents investors from "chasing" a stock too far beyond a buy point. XPO stock is closing on its June 13 all-time high of 115.49.


Investors should keep in mind that the base for XPO stock is [late stage](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-2/). Those patterns form after a stock has already been on a big run and carry added risk.



Stock Of The Day: XPO Logistics
-------------------------------


While XPO stock boasts [strong bottom-line growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/) in recent quarters — 44%, 88%, 103% and 63% growth in the last four reports — the company only started to turn a profit some two years ago. That's weighing down XPO's EPS Rating, which is a 72 out of 99.


That in turn is affecting the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) for the latest IBD Stock of the Day, which is an 80. The Composite Rating looks at key fundamental and technical metrics like earnings and sales growth, profit margins, ROE and price performance.


However, the stock has a highest-possible Timeliness Rating of A, which factors in recent earnings changes and price performance.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is still a ways off its June peak.


Transportation and trucking peer **JB Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) is working on a base and trading 4% below a buy point. And [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) member **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) is in buy range after a breakout last Thursday. Several rail stocks also are working well.

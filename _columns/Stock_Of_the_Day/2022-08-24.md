**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the consumer electronics giant prepares to unveil its iPhone 14 smartphones and other devices at a product launch next month. Meanwhile, Apple stock has set a new, lower buy point amid the recent market pullback.




In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Apple stock rose a fraction to 167.53.


Apple stock has been climbing since its better-than-expected [report for the June quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-nears-buy-point-after-top-gun-style-june-quarter/). Strong iPhone sales and services revenue drove the company's outperformance in its fiscal third quarter, which ended June 25.


Next up for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is its fall product launch event, scheduled for Sept. 7. Apple sent out invitations for the event to the media and analysts on Tuesday. In addition to the iPhone 14 series handsets, Apple is likely to introduce new smartwatches at the event, the Apple Watch Series 8 wearables.


Apple Stock Forms Handle
------------------------


Apple stock is in a 34-week [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 183.04, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. That buy point is 10 cents above the stock's all-time high of 182.94 reached on Jan. 4, based on [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


However, with a recent retreat in the shares, Apple stock has formed a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) with a new buy point of 176.25.


Aggressive investors also could have picked up Apple stock after a bullish bounce off its 21-day line.

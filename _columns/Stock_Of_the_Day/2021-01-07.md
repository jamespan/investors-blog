**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as it flirts with its 10-week moving average, traveling just above it. The move presents a buy opportunity for Snap stock.




Snap's widely used social media platform, Snapchat, is a smartphone app designed to manipulate and enhance images and videos in numerous ways and be sent to other users. It also has an expanding lineup of video content and games, and is popular with the under-30 crowd.


Snap reported having 249 million daily active users at the end of its third quarter, up 18% from the year-ago period and topping Wall Street expectations.


On Thursday, Snap stock had pulled back to its 10-week moving average, which presented a buy opportunity. It also broke a downtrend in a short consolidation. Shares jumped 5.3% to close at 52.44.

Snap Stock Bounces Off 10-Week Line
-----------------------------------


The [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) plots a stock's average closing price over the past 10 weeks. When another week of trading wraps up, a new 10-week average gets calculated. Hence, the average is "moving." [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and Investors.com charts draw the 10-week line in red.


During afternoon trading on the stock market today, Snap stock touched the 10-week line at 48.34, marking the buy opportunity. The buy range extends to 53.17, or 10% above the buy point. If the 10-week line moves up in a couple of days to around 55 and the rally continues, it's often an opportunity to add more shares to core positions.


Snap scored big with its eye-catching [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) in 2017 that raised $3.4 billion and gave it a market valuation of $23.8 billion. That made [Snap the largest U.S.-listed IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) among tech companies since **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). But the party didn't last long as Snap stock plunged the following day and continued falling for months.


That occurred as Snap was under constant pressure from Facebook, which aggressively copied most of [Snapchat's best features](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-instagram-group-video-chat/) and added them to its Instagram Stories platform.


However, after a period of restructuring and the aggressive development of new products, Snap began to cast off the Facebook pressure. It also began drawing in more advertisers.


A Blowout Third Quarter
-----------------------


The fruits of those efforts became clear when Snap reported [third quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-reports-third-quarter-earnings-estimates/) that knocked the socks off Wall Street analysts. They were expecting third-quarter revenue of $550.5 million. Snap delivered $678 million. Instead of an expected 5-cent loss, Snap showed a 1-cent profit.


Snap stock reacted by soaring 28% in heavy volume.


A technical analysis of Snap stock is a key component of [determining whether it's worth buying](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-or-sell-large-cap-stocks/).


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-inc-tsla.aspx) shows that Snap currently has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 88 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Snap stock currently outperforms 88% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


Snap Stock's High Relative Strength Rating
------------------------------------------


It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 96. The rating shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in IBD's database.


Snap stock also trades above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) moving average. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near a record high. The relative strength line compares a stock's price action with that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line means the stock is lagging.

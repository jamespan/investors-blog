With today's rally, the stock has jumped out of a normal buy zone. However, the sound fundamentals of CrowdStrike stock are one reason to mull taking a position.


CrowdStrike Stock: Cybersecurity Firm Taking Share From Symantec, McAfee
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Investors should analyze today's intraday action. CrowdStrike stock surged nearly 17% to a high of 165.75. If it goes above that 165.75 high again, that's a bullish signal. Meanwhile, if investors already took a small position, a sell signal would be a clear close below today's low of 155.54.


Shares jumped 13.6% to close at 161.19.


Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike uses machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, and a specialized database to detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.


Demand for endpoint security has increased amid the corporate shift to remote work. Analysts say CrowdStrike has been gaining share from legacy security providers, such as **Broadcom**'s ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) Symantec unit and McAfee.


Older antivirus software looks for "signatures" of known malicious software. However, more advanced machine learning tools, such as CrowdStrike's, learn to identify malware traits rather than specific signatures. That enables them to detect new types of malware.


CrowdStrike Earnings Top Views Amid ARR Growth
----------------------------------------------


In the October quarter, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike late Wednesday said it earned an adjusted 8 cents a share, while revenue jumped 86% to $232.5 million. Analysts had projected CrowdStrike would break even on revenue of $213.5 million.


CrowdStrike said it added 1,186 subscription customers, up from 969 a year earlier. That included 64 subscribers from Preempt Security, which it acquired on Sept. 30.


Another bright spot was a financial metric called annual recurring revenue.


Annual recurring revenue increased 81% to $907 million, topping estimates of $852 million. Preempt provided $6.8 million of that, but CrowdStike handily beat estimates without the acquisition.


"Third quarter results should mute lingering skepticism that CRWD's momentum is a transient phenomenon resulting from a pandemic-induced surge in business activity," UBS analyst Fatima Boolani said in a report to clients.


CrowdStrike Technical Ratings
-----------------------------


Mizuho Securities analyst Gregg Moskowitz in his note to clients noted that management called out a record number of "seven-figure" annual recurring revenue transactions on its earnings call.


The cybersecurity firm holds an IBD [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/)of 94 out of a best-possible 99. That means it has outperformed 94% of stocks over the past 12 months.


CrowdStrike stock, meanwhile, has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of B. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on a scale of A+ to E, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Meanwhile, the CrowdStrike initial public offering in June 2019 raised $659 million with shares priced at 34.


CrowdStrike stock has jumped about over 220% this year. Meanwhile, Zscaler stock has soared some 295%. Zscaler stock is very extended with Thursday's gain.


Zscaler's cloud-based computer security services have thrived amid the shift to a work-from-home economy. Analysts say a key move for Zscaler stock was bringing in Dali Rajic as chief revenue officer in September 2019.

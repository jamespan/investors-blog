UHAL stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the iconic U-Haul truck company nears a buy point after finding bullish support at a key technical level.




**Amerco** ([UHAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHAL)), the parent company behind U-Haul, operates a fleet of 176,000 trucks, 126,000 trailers and 46,000 towing devices.


U-Haul, the nation's largest "do-it-yourself" moving company, also offers roughly 812,000 self-storage units for rent. The coronavirus pandemic spurred a massive shift in terms of Americans working from home, letting them flee crowded cities for suburbs and satellite cities. Meanwhile, as the pandemic eases, other Americans are pulling up stakes after "sheltering in place" in 2020.


These trends are likely to propel Amerco earnings even higher.

UHAL Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares of Amerco rose 1.5% to 662 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), after finding support at their 10-week line in recent days. UHAL stock has formed a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 677.44 buy point on top of a longer consolidation, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It sits 2% below the entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for UHAL stock is just below the March high and not far from all-time highs. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart provided and shows a multiyear decline prior to the pandemic.



In terms of several key IBD ratings, the U-Haul truck leasing company screens well.


UHAL stock earns a near-perfect 98 [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score.


A solid [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 87 means the stock has outperformed 87% of all stocks in the past year.


Its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Accumulation%2fDistribution+(Acc%2fDis)+Rating&termid=1) is a B-, on a scale of A+ to E, a sign of moderate institutional buying over the past 13 weeks. The stock enjoys decent institutional sponsorship, though the number of funds owning UHAL stock fell to 795 in September, down 4% from June.


The commercial services leasing group, to which Amerco belongs, ranks a relatively strong No. 31 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx) tool.


The group includes **Herc Rentals** ([HRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRI)), which leases various equipment including trucks and trailers. **Penske** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)) also rents out moving trucks. In storage rentals, Amerco's peers include **CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)) and **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)). And given pandemic demand, various startups are disrupting the market for moving trucks and vans, such as Fluid Truck.

Amerco Earnings and Fundamentals
--------------------------------


On Aug. 5, UHAL stock surged 7.5% to a multimonth high after Amerco crushed first-quarter earnings views. On a per-share basis, Amerco earnings vaulted 294% to $17.60, more than double estimates. Sales jumped 49%, accelerating for a fourth straight quarter. Results were helped in part by easy comparisons, with the company lapping a pandemic hit a year ago.


In all of fiscal 2022, Wall Street expects Amerco earnings to jump 53% as sales increase 18%, according to FactSet. On a per-share basis, Amerco earnings more than doubled in 2021 after falling 20% the prior year amid the pandemic.


As a result, the U-Haul company sports a merely good-enough [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 80.


In 2021, Amerco showed strength across key business segments. Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased 15% year over year. Self-storage revenues rose 14%. Sales of self-moving and self-storage products and services jumped 30%.


But Amerco fell short on capital expenditures. "Growth of rental equipment and self-storage came in behind plan due to pandemic-related disruptions," Chairman Joe Shoen said in a letter to shareholders. "Some of these disruptions remain."


In 2022, Amerco expects to keep reinvesting in the business. Spending to grow its truck fleet and to make acquisitions is likely to increase, it says.

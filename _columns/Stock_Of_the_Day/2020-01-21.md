**Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the law enforcement body camera supplier and digital records manager heads for a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), despite a high-stakes battle with the Federal Trade Commission.




Axon stock has recouped much of its two-day, 11% drop triggered by news on Jan. 3 that the [FTC wants to break up Axon](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/axon-stock-falls-from-buy-zone-on-extraordinary-ultimatum-from-ftc/) into two competing firms. Both firms would use Axon's own intellectual property for capturing and managing police evidence.


The FTC has challenged Axon's May 2018 acquisition of Vievu, which won a big contract to supply the New York Police Department in the fall of 2016. Axon argues that Vievu was a "failing firm" that had no other takers, so antitrust restrictions shouldn't apply.


Axon Enterprise, formerly known as Taser, announced the imminent FTC action on Jan. 3 as it launched its own counterattack. Axon sued the FTC in federal district court, challenging its "unconstitutional structure and processes," while seeking an injunction. The FTC set an administrative trial for May 19.

Axon Stock Analysis
-------------------


Axon stock rose 2.3% to 75.26 in Tuesday [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). That puts the stock about 3% below a 76.72 buy point from a shallow [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/), according to a [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool). The double bottom reflects a sell-off, following the FTC news, that undercut Axon's 69.10 low on Dec. 19. That low came a bit more than three weeks into Axon's consolidation after it hit a record high 77.66 on Nov. 26, but that breakout attempt failed to gain traction.


After the FTC-related sell-off, Axon stock found support at its 50-day line.


Previously, Axon stock went through an 18-month, up-and-down period without making progress. That abruptly changed with its better-than-expected Q3 earnings report after the close on Nov. 7.


In Q3, Axon earnings jumped 40% to 28 cents a share, while revenue grew 25% to $130.8 million. The following day, Axon stock soared 24.6% to 65.29. It kept chugging higher over the next three weeks before momentum flagged.


Axon stock has a 93 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a possible 99. The single rating reflects earnings, sales, margin, and stock performance trends.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remains below recent peaks in June and November, meaning Axon stock has underperformed the S&P 500 since then. Ideally, the RS line would at least cross a short-term high if and when Axon stock breaks out.



Axon Enterprise Business
------------------------


Axon Enterprise now has dominant positions supplying Tasers and body cameras to law enforcement. But the broad adoption of bodycams this decade created the problem of managing terabytes of digital evidence while meeting privacy requirements. That means deleting footage and blurring out faces and license plates when a video must be shared. Axon leapt into the void and has continued to innovate as it manages digital records via the cloud.


Strong Q3 results followed a few quarters of declining earnings and slower sales growth as customers paused in anticipation of product upgrades. The new Taser 7 boasts better accuracy and performance, while the latest Axon Body 3 camera has wireless connectivity that allows police departments to monitor incidents in real time.


Taser sales accounted for $71.4 million in third-quarter sales, about 55% of the total. Sensors, or body cameras, and related software brought in $25.1 million. Meanwhile, Axon Cloud sales reached $34 million, up 42% from a year ago.


Now Axon is targeting a new, related market. Records management involves the core software that police departments use to manage all their records, like incident reports. Currently, that market is dominated by legacy technology that isn't equipped to handle digital video evidence. Analysts expect an upgrade cycle and see Axon as well-positioned.


FTC Antitrust Fight Vs. Axon Enterprise
---------------------------------------


If the FTC wins its case against Axon, the consequences would be seriously disruptive. Regulators want to force Axon to transfer technology, customers and even its own employees as part of a plan to subsidize the cost of standing up a rival.


Axon argues that its market is competitive. Competitors have won 55 bids to provide body cameras to agencies with more than 100 officers since the deal. Last year, Motorola acquired competitor WatchGuard for $271 million. However, the FTC says that Axon dominates the body camera market for major metropolitan police departments.


The FTC outcome could turn on whether, as Axon argues, its Vievu acquisition "falls squarely within the 'failing firm' safe harbor." Axon says Vievu was distressed enough to qualify as a failing firm, losing $1 million per month at the time of the deal. To satisfy antitrust concerns, the acquisition has to be in danger of imminent business failure, unable to reorganize through bankruptcy and unable to find other buyers.


The penalty sought by the FTC seems extreme. Yet there is some precedent when the acquirer phases out competing technology, rather than adding to its value. In 2014, the Justice Department reached a settlement with Bazaarvoice over its acquisition of PowerReviews to restore competition eliminated in the market for online product ratings and reviews.


In a blog post, Axon CEO Rick Smith said Vievu's technology "suffered security flaws, data loss, and even safety issues that caused the cameras to burst into flames."


Axon's constitutional challenge of the FTC looks like more than a hail mary. In 2008, Whole Foods sued the FTC for denying it due process in an administrative trial over its proposed Wild Oats merger. Whole Foods eventually settled.


In 2007, the Antitrust Modernization Commission appointed by Congress recommended "prohibiting the FTC from pursuing administrative litigation," noted Sheppard Mullin attorneys Thomas Dillickrath and Molly Lorenzi in a blog post.


Bottom line: The FTC case could take a couple of years to reach a conclusion, making it more a long-term concern for the Axon stock and business.

**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after blowing away fiscal fourth-quarter earnings estimates and giving upbeat guidance late Thursday. Nike stock surged into buy range.




The sports apparel giant earned 93 cents a share, crushing estimates for 51 cents and swinging from a year-ago loss of 51 cents a share. Revenue soared 96% to $12.3 billion, topping views for $11.03 billion.


North American sales shot up 141% to $5.4 billion. Europe, Middle East and Africa sales jumped 107% excluding currency changes to $3 billion. Asia Pacific & Latin America sales surged 76% to $1.46 billion.


Greater China sales grew 9% to $1.9 billion. China called for a boycott of Western goods after Nike and others accused Chinese officials of using forced labor in the cotton industry. On an earnings call, Nike said it's seeing monthly improvements in China sales.


While most Nike stores are now open, digital purchases have fueled sales throughout the pandemic. Nike Brand Digital revenue jumped 41% in Q4 after soaring 147% in 2019. Online sales surged 59% in Q3, after accelerating to 84% growth in Q2 from 82% in Q1. Late Thursday, Nike said its membership program, which now tops 300 million worldwide, is helping to boost online sales.


Nike sees fiscal 2022 sales topping $50 billion vs. analyst views for $48.5 billion.

------------------


The Olympics are seen as a tentpole marketing opportunity to build brand awareness and unveil new products. Nike's latest gear will be on full display at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics as it designed the apparel and shoes for Team USA. U.S. athletes have been donning Nike gear since the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy. Nike's current deal with Team USA lasts at least through the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.


"This summer in Tokyo, we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations," said Nike CEO John Donahoe in an earnings call on March 18.


FlyEase technology involves a hinge that allows you to put on and remove your shoes hands-free.


Meanwhile, Nike's newest track shoes, Dragonfly, which retails for $195, have been out of stock for weeks as the pros snapped them up for this week's U.S. Olympic Track U.S. Track and Field trials in Eugene, Oregon

**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) is [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The pizza maker is forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) but it's also giving investors an early buying opportunity. DPZ stock rose.




Many restaurants have struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic as lockdowns hurt sit-down restaurants. But Domino's, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and other fast-food and fast-casual chains have done well as takeout and delivery orders climbed.


In a July 22 note to investors, Morningstar analysts highlighted Domino's focus on carryout, allowing it "to compete with quick-service drive-thrus without having to pursue more expensive real estate."


Domino's has been opening up more stores to help it cut down delivery times and stay competitive with delivery services like **Uber**'s ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) UberEats, Postmates and **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)).


But analysts have warned that Domino's aggressive expansion plans could end up being detrimental to current stores.

DPZ Stock Buying Opportunities
------------------------------


Shares rose 1.4% to 521.37 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). DPZ stock is rebounding from its 50-day line, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The stock is working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 548.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), following a gap-up on earnings in late July. But the 50-day rebound, and breaking a downward-sloping trend line, offers an early option. Investors could use 521.08, just above Friday's high, as a DPZ stock early entry.



Chipotle stock has been trading very tightly near highs for several weeks following its late July earnings gap-up. CMG shares rose 0.6%. Wingstop briefly cleared a flat base on Wednesday, topping the 177.92 buy point. But WING stock reversed lower for a 0.6% decline to 176.81.


DASH stock rose 1.9% to 200.92, clearing a short consolidation within a much larger pattern.


Domino's stock has a 78 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) out of a best possible 99 and an EPS Rating of 73. The Composite Rating compiles scores on key fundamental and technical metrics: earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher.

**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the information technology provider's stock appears extended. It may be time to cash in on some Epam stock.




Shares have gained 23% from its [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 144.29. Newtown, Pa.-based Epam stock rallied after its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations, while March-quarter guidance exceeded Wall Street targets.


Epam's fiscal first-quarter earnings are due on May 9. Analysts estimate Epam earnings growth of 26% to $1.17 a share. Epam has consistently produced earnings growth in the mid-20% range, but it may be time to take profits, since shares are now well above the buy zone.


While there are no topping signals on the chart, growth stock typically rise 20% or 25% before they start their next price consolidations. With earnings coming in several days, it is prudent to lock in the profits and avoid the risk of an earnings-related sell-off.


Further, Epam stock trades in much smaller volume than other info tech services firms like **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)), as well as India outsourcing companies such as **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)).

Epam Stock: Eastern Europe Roots A Strength
-------------------------------------------


The company has thrived by hiring computer software developers in Eastern Europe. Most of Epam's offshore centers are located in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Hungary.


Epam sets itself apart by specializing in custom software development and product engineering services. One of its top clients is **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Google. Epam provides digital transformation services via Google's cloud computing business.


Other clients include investment bank **UBS** ([UBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBS)), Aer Lingus and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE))-unit GE Healthcare Science.


"In the medium term, we believe further upside for the company will be driven by EPAM's push into intelligent automation, RPA (robotic process automation), and machine learning," William Blair analyst Maggie Nolan said in a February report to clients.


Epam Works With Robotic Process Automation Firms
------------------------------------------------


RPA firms provide tools that program robotic software to automate human tasks. Their bots are best suited for manual, high volume, repetitive tasks in back-office operations such as accounting, billing and customer service work. Accenture and Cognizant also partner with RPA firms, such as privately held UiPath and Automation Anywhere.


"EPAM is well positioned to benefit from a significant funding uptick for digital projects with enterprises in the process of integrating front-end digital platforms with their back-end legacy infrastructure, essentially deeming EPAM engineering expertise critical," Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said in a recent note to clients.


Epam has focused on customers in financial services, life sciences and media. But it's moving into new verticals, such as automotive.


Susquehanna Financial Group analyst James Friedman said in a report, "The company has strong traction in energy and is seeing new revenue streams with consulting business lines, which is a positive for revenue trends."


Epam stock edged up 1.3% to 179.60 in afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?).

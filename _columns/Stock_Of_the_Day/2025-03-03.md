**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) amid rising profit estimates and sharply accelerating growth. On Monday, Urban Outfitters stock flashed a bullish signal in a buy range.


On Feb. 26, the apparel retailer reported record holiday-quarter revenues and fiscal 2025 profits. The fiscal year ends in January.


Led by its Free People and Anthropologie brands, the company saw earnings growth surge both year over year and quarter over quarter. Several analysts lifted price targets on URBN stock, FactSet shows.




Urban Outfitters Stock Flirts With Breakout
-------------------------------------------


Shares of Urban Outfitters rose 1.2% to 58.86 in Monday's [stock market action](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Urban Outfitters stock  briefly topped a 60.90 flat-base buy point intraday while clearing an early entry at 58.35, according to [MarketSurge charts](https://marketsurge.investors.com).


Last week, URBN stock crossed a trendline entry as it rebounded from its 50-day moving average.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the chart provided here, made a new high on Monday. That is indicated by the blue circle on the MarketSurge chart. It's a favorable sign when the RS line makes a new high as a stock breaks out. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming vs. the S&P 500 index.



A 94 RS Rating means Urban Outfitters has outpaced 94% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year. Its stock is also the highest among 30 stocks in the apparel and shoes retail industry group.


Urban Outfitters Earnings And Outlook
-------------------------------------


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-urban-outfitters-urbn.aspx) tool shows that URBN stock carries a [Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1) of 97 out of 99.

Urban Outfitters holds an EPS Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 as well, the highest in the group.

This Retailer's Turnaround
--------------------------


Eight analysts raised targets on Urban Outfitters stock after the Q4 report, FactSet shows. No one cut. But their average target of 60.87 is just a notch above where URBN shares traded on Monday.

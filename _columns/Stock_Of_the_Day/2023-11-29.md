LRCX Stock Drops After Earnings Report
--------------------------------------


Last month, LRCX stock fell after Lam Research topped fiscal first-quarter estimates but disappointed with its longer-term outlook.


The Fremont, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $6.85 a share on sales of $3.48 billion in the [quarter ended Sept. 24](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lam-research-corporation-reports-financial-results-for-the-quarter-ended-september-24-2023-301960990.html). On a year-over-year basis, Lam Research earnings fell 34% as sales declined 31%. It was the company's third straight quarter of declining sales and earnings.


On a conference call with analysts, Lam executives gave cautious commentary about their expectations for wafer fabrication equipment spending in 2024. They also noted that a recent sales surge to customers in China is likely to moderate next year.


In a note to clients, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said Lam's sales gains in China masked its weakness in Taiwan and South Korea. Plus, the spending level in China is likely not sustainable, he said. Curtis rates Lam Research stock as equal weight, or neutral.


LRCX stock tumbled 6.3% in the first trading session after its earnings report.

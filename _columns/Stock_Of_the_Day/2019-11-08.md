**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it looks to retake a buy point less than a week after narrowly avoiding a sell signal.




Best known for its stretchy yoga pants, the firm has been expanding its reach by offering apparel items for running and general fitness training. As part of its latest five-year growth plan, it is also entering the athletic shoe market. Management also wants to double men's sales and digital sales.


Lululemon is also growing through overseas expansion. It wants to quadruple international sales by 2023, and the lucrative Chinese market is seen as a big opportunity. At the end of fiscal 2018, the firm had a total of 440 company-operated stores. But China was only its fourth-biggest territory, with its 22 stores lagging Australia's 29.


Lululemon Stock Rebounds
------------------------


Shares closed up 0.65% at 204.13 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), closing in again on a 204.54 buy point from a five-week flat base. Among rival stocks, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was down 0.7%, **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)) lost 0.6%, and troubled **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) dipped 0.2%.


Lululemon stock broke out last month, but then sold off sharply, falling as much as 6.5% below the entry point as of Monday. That just stopped short of [the 7%-8% sell rule for limiting losses](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/).

Since then the stock has staged a bullish rebound from its 50-day line, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Institutional investors often use the 50-day line as a reference point, stepping in to add shares to their positions when a stock pulls back to the moving average. This buying creates upward pressure that keeps a stock's price above the moving average.


The [Leaderboard stock's relative strength line](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) has been making strong progress throughout most of 2019. A solid spate of institutional buying could spark further upward momentum for the important technical indicator.


Lululemon stock currently has a [best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-lululemon-athletica-lulu.aspx) shows its per-share earnings growth rate has averaged 36% over the past three quarters. This is even better than the three-year growth rate of 27%. For the last couple of quarters EPS has grown by 35%, which is comfortably clear of the [25% growth sought by the CAN SLIM cognoscente](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).



Analyst Sees Lululemon Delivering Male Gains
--------------------------------------------


Piper Jaffray senior analyst Erinn Murphy believes attracting more male customers presents a big opportunity for Lululemon. She rates the stock as overweight with a 227 target.


"We estimate LULU's share of the overall athletic market has grown from 2.4% to 3.6%, driven largely by women's," category, she said in a Sept. 23 research note. "With men's acceleration augmenting women's strength, we see share gains ahead. Last year, men's generated around $700M vs. Nike's men's apparel-only business at around $9B."


She also thinks the firm will rake in cash if it can get enough customers to enroll in its fledgling loyalty program. It is still in test mode, but for an annual fee of $148 members receive an exclusive pair of pants or shorts, special access to classes and events, and expedited shipping on e-comm orders.


"Should LULU convert 3M consumers to the program over time (vs. the 7M shoppers they claimed in 2018) it would add more than $700M in sales & more than $1 in EPS," she said.

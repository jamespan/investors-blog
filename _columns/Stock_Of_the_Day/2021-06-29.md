Gildan stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the consumer apparel maker offers an early buy point after finding bullish support at a key level.




Montreal-based **Gildan Activewear** ([GIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIL)) specializes in selling its T-shirts, underwear, socks and hosiery in bulk to printers, brands or companies, which may then choose to embellish the clothing as they see fit. It's growing online and benefiting as consumers spend more on clothes. Meanwhile, growth is rebounding after a tough couple years.


Gildan owns about 25 apparel manufacturing factories around the world. The Canadian company spins its own yarn, assembles the final garments and distributes its products.


In 2017, Gildan acquired the American Apparel brand. The company traces its origins to a children's apparel brand that began in Montreal in 1946.


Gildan supplies **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) for its fast-growing private clothing labels, including Goodthreads. It also supplies private labels at **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). Private brands offer competition to Gildan's own brands. But the shift to private-label offerings at retail giants also boosts revenue, Gildan says.


Like [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Figs** ([FIGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIGS)), Gildan benefits from a specialized focus in apparel. [Robinhood stock Figs](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/robinhood-stock-figs-wants-to-be-the-lululemon-of-medical-scrubs/) specializes in medical scrubs and apparel.

GIL Stock: Back To Basics
-------------------------


The Back To Basics strategy focuses on optimizing costs and simplifying the product portfolio. Gildan launched the strategy in 2017, consolidating business units and rationalizing less productive SKUs. At the same time, it's introducing new products in growth markets.


Rising inflation is a headwind. It also operates in a highly competitive industry segment. Major rivals include **Hanesbrands** ([HBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HBI)) and Fruit of the Loom, a unit of **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)).


In Q1, results benefited from stimulus check and a "$50 million restock impact" as distributors rushed to restock. Those are likely one-off benefits and may not continue.


Six analysts on Wall Street rate Gildan stock a buy, one has a hold and none has a sell, TipRanks says.

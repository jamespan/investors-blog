**GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), delivered strong earnings and robust orders in its first report as a pure-play aerospace company. GE stock popped, offering an early buying opportunity.




GE Aerospace emerged in April, along with **GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)), completing the former General Electric's long dismantling. The new company, a maker of jet engines and related parts, kept the GE stock ticker. GE Vernova business houses GE's former energy unit. **GE Healthcare** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)) was spun off in January 2023.

Orders in GE's commercial engines and services business surged almost 38% to $9.15 billion amid booming demand for spare parts.

**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) WFC stock is breaking out as Treasury yields rise on a strong jobs report.




The job market is roaring back, with employers adding 943,000 jobs in July, according to the Labor Department Friday. The bullish report sent the 10-year Treasury yield up 6 basis points to 1.28% on increasing confidence in the economic recovery. Wall Street is also expecting the Federal Reserve to start tapering its bond purchases.


Rising yields help banks widen their net interest margins and in turn boost their earnings.


Still, growing concerns about the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus are casting a shadow over economic growth. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) delayed its return to the office until January as employers scrap plans to return to the office in September.

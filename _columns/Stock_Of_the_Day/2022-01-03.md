**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Elon Musk's upscale electric-auto maker posted blockbuster fourth-quarter deliveries Sunday, sending Tesla stock soaring into buy range Monday.


[Tesla Q4 deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-flashes-buy-signal-as-record-q4-deliveries-seen/) totaled 308,600. That included 296,850 Model 3 and Y vehicles and 11,750 Model S and X luxury EVs. For the full year, Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles.


The figures smashed even the most upbeat of analyst expectations.


"This was a 'trophy case' quarter for Musk & Co.," Wedbush analysts wrote in a Jan. 2 note. The analysts called the numbers "jaw-dropping" and said the announcement "speaks to an EV demand trajectory that looks robust for Tesla heading into 2022."


Tesla sales have increased even as the automaker had several high-profile recalls in 2021, including a recall of 355,000 Model 3 vehicles and nearly 120,000 Model S vehicles in late December.

An earlier four-day climb pushed Tesla stock to a trendline, which has acted as resistance.

The move above the trendline and the breakout past the buy point create an emphatic buy point on the chart. The stock is in a buy range through 1,175.06.

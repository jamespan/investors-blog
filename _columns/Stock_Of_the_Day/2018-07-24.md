The strong performance of Monolithic Power's stock has earned it a spot on the [IBD 50 list of stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) with top-notch fundamentals.


In mid-April Monolithic Power stock broke out from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), having a buy point of 124.35. The stock reached a record high of 142.56 on June 22, then pulled back.


Flat-Base Formation
-------------------


Since then, the stock has [formed a flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), which can be a precursor to a winning stock's next big move. Bases are like a resting area where a stock takes a breather after climbing for a few weeks or months. It's an opportunity for the stock to regain its strength and launch the next stage of its ascent.


The current stock formation at Monolithic is a third-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), which is less likely than an earlier-stage base to generate a big run, but it has the potential.


Monolithic Power stock currently has a buy point of 142.66, as it gets ready to report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, after the close. Earnings reports can cause big swings in stocks up or down, depending on the numbers, so it's prudent to be attentive. Understand that buying a stock just ahead of earnings involves risk since you typically don't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the latest quarterly numbers come out. Be sure to follow sound [buy and sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/) to minimize your exposure.


The company beat consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines when it reported [first-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/monolithic-power-systems-mpwr-q1/) on April 30. Adjusted earnings rose 36% from the year-ago quarter to 79 cents per share. Revenue jumped 29% to $129.2 million.


Monolithic Power has a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) and holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It has a relative strength rating of 87. The best stocks typically have [an RS rating above 80](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/monolithic-power-systems-hits-80-plus-relative-strength-rating-benchmark/).

Albemarle Earnings
------------------


Albemarle mines or otherwise extracts lithium from the ground and processes it into battery-grade metal and other materials.


In a presentation from May, the company noted pressure from the automobile industry to "accelerate lithium supply growth." Albemarle also recently announced plans to build a lithium-production "megasite" in the U.S.


The company's second-quarter earnings last week beat Wall Street's expectations. The company raised its full-year sales forecast to $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion, up from an earlier forecast of $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion.


"The supply-demand balance has remained tight in the markets we serve," Albemarle CEO Kent Masters said during the company's earnings conference call. "Strong market prices and our continued success in contract renegotiation drove the tremendous strength we are experiencing in our lithium business."

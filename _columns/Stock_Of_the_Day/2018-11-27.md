Attunity Stock Caution

Attunity has an [IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94, meaning it is outpacing 94% of all stocks when it comes to the most important stock-picking criteria. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

California's August announcement of a $1.4 billion Covid-19 testing contract with **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) is just one of the recent successes that has powered PKI stock to record heights. PerkinElmer is Investor's Business Daily's [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




Needham analyst Stephen Unger crystallized PerkinElmer's recent success in a report to clients this month.


"We are impressed with the level of global adoption of PKI's broad portfolio of testing solutions related to Covid-19, which clearly bodes well for 2H20 into 2021," Unger wrote in upgrading his rating on PKI stock to buy from hold.


On Aug. 25, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced what the state called a "groundbreaking" and "first of its kind" contract with PerkinElmer. The deal will result in processing up to an additional 150,000 Covid-19 diagnostic tests per day. More than that, PerkinElmer is contractually obligated to provide test results in 24 to 48 hours. PKI stock jumped 2.8% on that news.

A week earlier, PerkinElmer launched a series of Explorer workstations capable of running 10,000 tests per day for SARS-CoV-2, the type of coronavirus that causes Covid-19. That, too, sparked the stock to a more than 1% rise.


A Sept. 16 report from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ranked PerkinElmer's Covid-19 nasal swab test the best by a key measure, and that sparked PKI stock to another 1.5% rise.


Covid-19 Testing Response Seven Years In The Making
---------------------------------------------------


The company's ability to respond so quickly to the pandemic was no accident, says Chief Executive Prahlad Singh.


"We've made a concerted effort the past seven years to optimize our portfolio in order to be nimble and respond to issues such as the Covid pandemic," Singh told IBD. "We're very grateful and thankful that we could respond."


PerkinElmer's efforts, of course, predate the pandemic. As Singh explained, the company made two key strategic moves. For one, it expanded into the high-growth life sciences and diagnostics industries from lower-growth industrials.


Also, the company emphasized consumables and services, with their ongoing revenue, over one-time instrument sales. Where instruments comprised 45% of total sales five to seven years ago, that market is now about 30% of the total, the CEO said.


Among its many markets, PerkinElmer products test expectant mothers for pregnancy-related health risks and screens newborn babies for genetic mutations. Its products help in drug development and in food safety and quality control.


PKI Stock Notches Record High
-----------------------------


It's adding up. PKI stock jumped as much as 2.2% to a record high of 124.66 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). By session's end, PKI stock gained 1.1% to close at 123.26.


That put PerkinElmer above a 123.31 buy point. Shares also cleared an early entry of 122.39 before retreating just under the buy zone.


Another bullish sign for PKI stock is its relative strength line hitting new highs. And shares have stayed above the 50-day line almost continuously for the past five months, passing a number of tests at that key support line.


The Waltham, Mass.-based company has focused on Covid-19 testing that can generate results quickly. Slow test results have been a bottleneck in the world's response to the pandemic. The new test workstations stress automation, looking to reduce staff time needed to take the tests and process results.


On the California contract, Needham's Unger wrote, "At full capacity, this contract has the potential to add over $400 million of incremental revenue per quarter." Under the contract, PerkinElmer will begin processing tests Nov. 1.


California Covid-19 Testing Contract On Track
---------------------------------------------


"We're working in tandem with the state 24/7, moving equipment into place, and I'm very confident we'll be ready," Singh said.


He also said PerkinElmer's customers include a number of companies developing Covid-19 vaccines.


Unger has a 12-month price target of 139 on PKI stock.


In his report, he noted that the company posted second-quarter revenue of $196 million from Covid-19-related products, including virus testing kits. Overall, the company reported second-quarter sales of $811.9 million, beating Wall Street views. The 12% year-over-year increase in revenue was its most since fourth quarter 2018.


Adjusted earnings did even better, rising 57% to $1.57. That marked the company's biggest percentage jump in earnings in at least five years.

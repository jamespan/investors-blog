**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the consumer electronics giant is seeing its shares climb ahead of its March-quarter earnings report next week. Apple stock is approaching a buy point.




Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple plans to report its fiscal second-quarter results on April 30 after the market close. It was the first major tech company to lower March-quarter forecasts because of production and sales disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic. It posted its warning on Feb. 17, just 20 days after it gave its guidance for the quarter.


Apple's contract manufacturers in China were delayed in resuming production because of the initial coronavirus outbreak. Then it closed its retail stores, starting in China, as governments issued social distancing mandates. Now, Apple is facing a likely recession that will impact demand for its premium-priced products.


Still, Apple stock has rebounded since the coronavirus stock market crash, which started in late February.

Apple Stock Has Formed Cup-With-Handle Base
-------------------------------------------


Apple stock is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 288.35, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). But the handle is just above the midpoint of the base, so there could be [overhead resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/).


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Apple stock dipped a fraction, to 275.03. Earlier in the session, it had risen as much as 2% to 281.75.


Apple stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92. That means it has outperformed 92% of stocks over the past 12 months. However, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has flattened lately in a cautious sign.



Wall Street Bracing For Negative Quarterly Report
-------------------------------------------------


Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings of $2.28 a share on sales of $54.79 billion in the March quarter. That would translate to year-over-year declines of 7% in earnings and 6% in sales.


For the June quarter, analysts are modeling Apple earnings of $2.08 a share, down 5%, on sales of $51.45 billion, down 4%.


Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple's actual fiscal second-quarter numbers probably don't matter than much, given the coronavirus crisis.


"Everybody knows that fiscal Q2 results will not be good," he said in a note to clients Wednesday. "We doubt the Q2 print will sway anybody's opinions one way or another, given the worst is likely yet to come."


Analysts will be looking for an update from Apple on business conditions and what sort of guidance it will give, Sacconaghi said. He rates Apple stock as market perform with a price target of 285.


The prevailing bullish narrative on Apple stock would change if the company delays its 5G iPhone beyond the holiday season, he said. A shift to sales of lower-priced handsets and slowing services growth also could ding Apple stock, Sacconaghi said.


Apple iPhone 12 Launch Timing Questioned
----------------------------------------


Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said the release timing for the rumored iPhone 12 series is still up in the air. Apple is likely to release the new handsets between October and early December, rather than the usual mid to late September launch. The lineup is likely to have both 4G and 5G handsets, he said.


"From a 5G perspective, there will be a U.S. and non-U.S. version introduced," Ives said in a note to clients Thursday. "The U.S. version will likely have mmWave technology, which does complicate the production timeline and also could see many units potentially shift to the March quarter vs. the December quarter."


Ives rates Apple stock as outperform with a 12-month price target of 335.


Apple stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94 out of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-inc-aapl.aspx). IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

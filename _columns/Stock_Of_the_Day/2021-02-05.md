Does **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) — the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) — have another big run in it? It may be a time to tiptoe back into Zoom stock as the company builds a broader service platform amid signs the Covid-19 pandemic may be subsiding.




One wild card: Zoom has raised cash and could go shopping to expand its products and compete better against larger companies.


During the coronavirus emergency, demand for Zoom videoconferencing software surged as businesses told employees to work from home. Zoom morphed into a social phenomenon as consumers downloaded the app to keep in touch with family and friends.


Zoom stock hit an all-time high of 588.84 set on Oct. 19. ZM stock then retreated amid positive vaccine news. It ended 2020 up more than 400% as many investors took profits.

Zoom Stock: Deep Correction Raises Questions
--------------------------------------------


Still, by early January Zoom stock had corrected nearly 44% from its all-time high. Not many stocks claw back from a correction that deep. ZM stock has [consolidated](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) recently and is now down some 30% from its all-time high. Shares were up 6.6% to 415.74 in afternoon action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


After some tight action, Zoom stock has poked above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). That's a bullish sign. It might be time to take a small position. If ZM stock forges more [traditional entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), investors could build up a position. Meanwhile, short interest in ZM stock fell sharply in January.


Zoom Video reports fourth quarter earnings on March 1. Management's 2021 guidance could be a catalyst.


Its October quarter earnings still showed tremendous growth.


Third-quarter earnings catapulted 1,000% to 99 cents a share on an adjusted basis from a year earlier. Revenue soared 367% to $777.2 million.


ZM Stock: Tough Year-Over-Year Comparisons
------------------------------------------


Zoom Video does not break out paid subscribers in financial reports.


The company said it had 433,700 business customers, each with more than 10 employees, as of Oct. 31. That was up from 370,200 in the July quarter.


For the upcoming April quarter and full-year 2021, however, Zoom stock will contend with tough year-over-year comparisons related to coronavirus outbreak.


If economies normalize amid Covid-19 vaccinations, the big question is what kind of growth trajectory ZM stock will revert to. It still could be a high-growth software stock when the coronavirus emergency subsides.


Zoom Phone Growth A Bright Spot
-------------------------------


Zoom has been busy improving products and adding features to its video platform. In January, the company said "Zoom Phone" had over 1 million cloud users. That was up from 500,000 cloud users that the company had noted at its October user conference called Zoomtopia.


Zoom Phone lets customers set up group internet phone calls without video. Zoom cross-sells the Zoom Phone tools to business customers that already use its Meetings software.


At Zoomtopia, management said there were 5,800 paid customers with more than 10 employees using Zoom Phone.


Zoom aims to build a broader platform with new applications, analysts say.


Zoom Stock: Cash On Balance Sheet Sets Stage For Acquisition
------------------------------------------------------------


To speed up platform development, Zoom may be prepping for an acquisition. It raised $2 billion in a secondary offering on Jan. 15. Zoom stock already had $1.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of Oct. 31.


So it now holds nearly $4 billion in cash.


When the coronavirus crisis eases, retaining small businesses as well as corporate accounts will be one key to Zoom's continued success. Another will be its ability to convert free users into paying subscribers.


ZM stock owns an IBD [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 out of a possible 99. Its relative strength line has been flattish in early 2021.


In addition, Zoom stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

DV Stock: Reducing Ad Fraud
---------------------------


New York City-based DoubleVerify provides digital media measurement and data analytics. The company reduces ad fraud by verifying advertising views and engagement by consumers online.


It also promises to ensure placement of ads in safe and suitable environments for brands. Founded in 2017, DoubleVerify competes with companies such as **Comscore** ([SCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCOR)) and **Integral Ad Science** ([IAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAS)) in the measurement segment.


Analysts expect the company to report December-ended quarter adjusted profit fell 35% to 11 cents amid high investments and acquisitions. Revenue is projected to climb 26% to $132.8 million, analysts say.


"We expect transaction volumes to continue to be the primary growth driver near term, fueled by client wins, international expansion, and channel expansion especially in social, internet TV and retail media," Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali said in a note to clients.


DoubleVerify launched an initial public offering in April 2021 with shares priced at 27. After forming an IPO base, DV stock spiked to a record high 48.42 in June 2021.


Upside From Netflix Ads?
------------------------


DoubleVerify has integrated its software across the digital advertising ecosystem, including programmatic platforms, social media channels  and digital publishers.


"DV is expanding its solution set onto various social platforms, including TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit and Twitch, aside from its two largest channels Facebook/Instagram and YouTube," added Squali.


On its fourth-quarter earnings call, meanwhile, management may provide more data on a new partnership with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Netflix in November launched an ad-supported service, called Basic With Ads.


Meanwhile, DoubleVerify's Relative Strength Rating stands at 83, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


In addition, DoubleVerify stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

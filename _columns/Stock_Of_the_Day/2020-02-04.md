Anaplan is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the business-planning software maker advances into a buy zone on strong volume. While competition from bigger rivals has at times weighed on Anaplan stock, the company's strong partner ecosystem has fueled revenue growth above 40%.




San Francisco-based **Anaplan** ([PLAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAN)) competes in the financial planning market against **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) and Adaptive Insights, now part of **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), among other rivals.


Anaplan went public in October 2018, with shares priced at 17. Anaplan stock gained 5.8% to 63.40 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?), climbing out of a consolidation above a [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 60.46.


The software maker's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has moved higher since it reported third-quarter earnings in November, although it's not quite at a new high. Anaplan still isn't profitable on an adjusted basis as it invests in its sales organization and other areas. But it has delivered 40%-plus quarterly revenue growth as a public company.

Anaplan Stock: Partners Generate More Deals
-------------------------------------------


Bigger rivals like Oracle, SAP and Workday can sell financial planning products as part of a broader software offering. Anaplan stock, though, has prospered by partnering with tech consultancies and information technology services providers.


Partners include Deloitte, EY, Bain, **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)) and India's Wipro.


In addition, over 50% of customer acquisitions involve some sort of partner arrangement.


"The percent of deals originated by partners is steadily increasing," Anaplan Chief Executive Frank Calderoni said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November.


He added: "I think it's really showing that, especially with the global partners that we work with, that they're seeing value within their practice to expanding the coverage and the consultants that they have within their firm on Anaplan. Some of them are developing specific solutions around Anaplan as a platform, and they're taking that to market."


Anaplan partners also help in grabbing bigger contracts. As of Oct. 31, Anaplan had 324 customers with annual recurring revenue, or ARR, of more than $250,000 each. That's up 42% from a year earlier.


Anaplan Stock: Average Recurring Revenue A Bright Spot
------------------------------------------------------


In the October quarter, average ARR for Anaplan's top 10 customers increased to $5.3 million. Average ARR for its top 25 customers rose to $3.5 million.


Anaplan helps train the consultants at partners to use its software tools. Further, many partners have stepped up hiring to bring Anaplan products to clients.


Anaplan stock analyst Terry Tillman of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey says the strategy is working versus bigger rivals like Oracle, SAP and Workday.


"Investments in driving partner success have increasingly paid dividends," Tillman said in a report to clients. "Deloitte has an estimated 500 to 600 professionals focused on doing Anaplan work. They are targeting a doubling of their Anaplan resources from current levels."


Further, Anaplan describes itself as pioneering in the category it calls "connected planning." The company says that "allows organizations to transform their businesses by making better and faster decisions." The software replaces **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Excel and other tools.


Mintigo Acquisition Provides Predictive Analytics Tools
-------------------------------------------------------


In August, Anaplan acquired Israeli business intelligence startup Mintigo. The purchase provided artificial intelligence and machine learning tools used in predictive analytics, mainly for marketing and sales.


Further, Anaplan has a software-as-a-service business model. The company said third-quarter subscription revenue rose 47% to $79.7 million.


In the quarter ending Jan. 31, Anaplan stock analysts estimate the company will lose 10 cents a share. That narrows its loss from 13 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts project 40% revenue growth to $97.15 million.


In October, Anaplan provided preliminary fiscal 2021 revenue guidance. The software maker said it expects revenue in a range of $455 million to $465 million. That's up 31% to 33% from a year earlier.

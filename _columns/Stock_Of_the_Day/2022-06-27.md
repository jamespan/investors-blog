**Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with HUM stock clearing at least one early buy point Monday and flirting with another. Medical stocks are the leading sector in the current market rally, and health insurers are a leading group.




In fact, Monday is the third straight IBD Stock Of The Day to feature a health insurer. Thursday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/unh-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-sets-up-as-investors-play-defense/), **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), cleared an official buy point Monday intraday. **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), Friday's Stock Of The Day, cleared an early entry on Monday.


On Jan. 6, HUM stock crashed 19% after the insurer slashed expected growth for its Medicare Advantage membership for 2022, citing changes in competition. That prompted Humana to invest $1 billion in growing its Medicare Advantage business. 


UnitedHealth hasn't had the same retention issues and says its Medicare Advantage business is in-line with expectations.


But Humana has been rebounding. In April, it sold 60% of its home hospice businesses to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for $2.8 billion. In May, Humana established a second joint venture with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe to develop 100 senior-focused primary care clinics. The venture will invest $1.2 billion in the Medicare clinics, which will start operating between 2023 and 2025. It follows an $800 million venture to open 67 clinics by early next year. 


Humana reported in late April that first-quarter earnings rose 5% due to solid performance from its pharmacy business and lower administrative costs. Revenue rose 16% to $24 billion. The company raised full-year estimates. Analysts expect double-digit earnings growth in 2022 and 2023. Humana has a three-year EPS growth rate of 4%.

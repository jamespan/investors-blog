**Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker holds strong on a rough day for stocks after posting a beat-and-raise quarterly report. MPWR stock has been in a relatively tight trading pattern for the past three weeks.




Late Thursday, the Kirkland, Wash.-based company delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results. It earned an adjusted $1.69 a share, up 56% year over year, on sales of $259.4 million, up 54%. Analysts expected earnings of $1.68 a share on sales of $258.1 million. Monolithic Power Systems had raised its guidance on Sept. 14, citing an improved business climate.


For the fourth quarter, it expects to generate sales of $224 million, based on the midpoint of its outlook. Wall Street was modeling $197 million in sales. Its guidance implied earnings per share of $1.22 at the midpoint, vs. the consensus target of $1.14. In the year-earlier period, Monolithic Power Systems earned $1.04 a share on sales of $166.7 million.


"MPS is well-positioned for continued growth driven by its high-growth end markets and share gains," Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a report Friday. He kept his buy rating on MPWR stock and upped his price target to 350 from 275.

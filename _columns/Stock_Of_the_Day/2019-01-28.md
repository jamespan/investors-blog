**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the pioneer in software-as-a-service bounces off the recent sell-off in technology companies. Salesforce stock is in the process of forming a cup-with-handle chart pattern over several weeks, a bullish signal.




San Francisco-based Salesforce is a bellwether among [SaaS and software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/saas-stocks-cloud-stocks/).


The enterprise software maker has gained about 7.5% in January, slightly outperforming the Nasdaq composite. SaaS stocks in particular and the broader software group have outperformed the Nasdaq this month.


Following December's rout of technology stocks, the big question has been whether talk of a recession by 2020 will spook companies into cutting back on spending.

"While IT budget growth in 2019 remains front of mind for tech investors, we think Salesforce can continue to put up strong numbers as a share gainer even in a slower-growth spending environment," said UBS analyst Jennifer Lowe in a Jan. 22 report.


Salesforce Nears Cup-With-Handle Chart Pattern
----------------------------------------------


Salesforce stock hit an all-time high in September, then weakened along with IBD's Computer-Software Enterprise group. That group has [bounced back to No. 3](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-25-2019/) among the 197 groups followed by IBD. It had ranked No. 73 eight weeks ago.


Salesforce stock has neared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 153.37 owing to the handle's formation. That's an adjustment from the previous entry point of 161.19 tied to its all-time high in late September.


The company sells software under a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. The company has expanded into marketing, customer services and e-commerce.


"Ongoing product innovation, meanwhile, can help drive Salesforce adoption deeper within the customer base, bolstering both sales efficiency and, as an output, margins," Lowe added.


Salesforce stock has reacted favorably to the company's purchase of MuleSoft, a sign that investors may be getting more comfortable with its many acquisitions. The enterprise software maker in May bought MuleSoft in a $6.5 billion cash-and-stock deal.


Salesforce, Adobe Rivalry Increasing
------------------------------------


Salesforce has been a fierce rival of **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Competition with **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), a digital media and marketing software firm, has been rising. Adobe in September bought Marketo for $4.75 billion.


"We don't see the near term as a zero sum game of Salesforce.com vs. Adobe, and believe there is room for both to be large winners," said Rob Oliver, a Baird analyst, in a 2019 outlook published on Jan. 8.


Salesforce in November reported adjusted third-quarter earnings of 61 cents a share, up 45% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 26% to $3.39 billion, topping consensus estimates. Third-quarter profit included a 6-cent investment gain, the company said.


Analysts say traction in nabbing large contracts and new verticals such as health care, financial services and government has been a bright spot.


Salesforce has been [expanding in Silicon Valley](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tech-companies-move-east-silicon-valley-companies/) as well as in New York. It has a new corporate headquarters in San Francisco.


Salesforce stock slipped 1.6% to close at 147.33 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Despite the Nasdaq's volatility in December, Salesforce stock is up 30% from a year ago.

AppFolio Stock: 2015 IPO

Founded in 2006, AppFolio went public in 2015 with an initial public offering that raised $86 million.


AppFolio focuses on residential property management. It has some 19,000 property management customers. In the June quarter, total units on the AppFolio property manager platform rose 13% from a year earlier to 7.7 million.

Third quarter sales rose 32% to $165.4 million.


AppFolio competes with property management software providers Yardi, RealPage, MRI Software and Entrata. Private-equity firm Thoma Bravo LP acquired RealPage for $9.6 billion in 2021.


AI Leasing Assistant

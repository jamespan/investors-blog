**Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The coronavirus stock is approaching a buy point on enthusiasm for its role supplying Covid vaccine makers.




Maravai makes a component necessary to manufacture messenger RNA vaccines, or mRNA, for the likes of [**Moderna**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/) ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), and [**Pfizer**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) with development partner **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)). But coronavirus stock investors are looking beyond Covid, says UBS analyst Dan Brennan.


"The utility and update of the mRNA modality is materially greater today than just six months ago, a benefit to Maravai," Brennan said in a report to clients. He has a buy rating on Maravai stock, and raised his price target to 53 from 50 on its strong earnings report.


Coronavirus Stock: Why Covid Isn't The End
------------------------------------------


The type of coronavirus that causes Covid is covered in so-called spike proteins. Vaccines from coronavirus stocks Pfizer and Moderna insert instructions for the body to make a single spike protein, prompting an immune response.

Their vehicle for those instructions? Messenger RNA. But there's a catch to the use of mRNA. The mRNA strands need what's known as a molecular cap in order to stay biologically active. Maravai makes those molecular caps. And the coronavirus stock has risen alongside other Covid players.


In the first quarter, sales in Maravai's nuclear acid production business — which makes those molecular caps — soared nearly 307% to $123.9 million. That accounted for almost 84% of sales for the three-month period ended March 31.


Overall revenue surged 191% to $148.2 million. Maravai earnings also rocketed 167% to 24 cents per share, on an adjusted basis. Both measures widely beat forecasts.


Maravai stock fell 1.3% on May 11, the day after its first-quarter earnings release. But the coronavirus stock has risen for each of the three days following. Shares retook their 50-day line on May 12 and haven't looked back, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The stock ended Friday at 37.93, up 3.2%.


Solidly Profitable, Growing Sales
---------------------------------


Analysts following the coronavirus stock expect Maravai to be solidly profitable with revenue growing in the triple-digit range for the next two quarters.



For the year, Maravai now expects $680 million to $720 million in sales. Even the low end of guidance beat forecasts. Sales would skyrocket from $280 million in 2020.


And even that might be conservative, UBS' Brennan said. Coronavirus stock Pfizer recently called for $26 billion in full-year sales of its Covid vaccine. Moderna expects $19.2 billion in sales of its coronavirus vaccine. In the future, some say there might be a need for Covid vaccine booster shots.


So, even though Brennan expects demand for Covid vaccines to decline beyond 2022, there could still be room for Maravai sales to run "given growing demand for mRNA modality."


[The coronavirus stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/ipos-path-swim-mrvi-ntst-hayw-ocdx-vei-lead-list-of-top-ipo-stocks-to-watch/) is now eyeing a buy point at 39.95. Further, its relative strength line isn't far from recent highs.

Representatives of Maravai didn't immediately return a request for comment.

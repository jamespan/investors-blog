**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the consumer electronics giant is poised for a big holiday sales season and is raising production targets for next year. Apple stock surged on Tuesday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Apple stock jumped 5% to 127.88. Investors responded positively to a news report that [Apple is increasing its iPhone production orders](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-rises-increased-iphone-production-2021/) for next year.


Apple told its suppliers that it expects to order up to 230 million iPhones in 2021, Nikkei Asia reported. That would be a 20% increase over 2019, Nikkei said.


"While the Street is forecasting roughly 215 million iPhone units for fiscal 2021, we believe based on the current trajectory and in a bull case (that Apple) has potential to sell north of 240 million units, which would eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in fiscal 2015," Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to clients.

High-End iPhone 12 Models Are Most Desired
------------------------------------------


Nikkei said Apple is seeing strong demand for premium iPhone 12 models, including the Pro and Pro Max versions.


"The Nikkei story is consistent with our channel checks, which point to strong demand for high-end iPhone 12 models," Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a note to clients. He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 135.


Daryanani cautioned that investors should "always take production plans with a grain of salt."


"Given the pandemic and potential for consistent supply-chain disruptions, it's logical for Apple and others to be more aggressive with their forecasts vs. not," he said.


Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross raised his price target on Apple stock to 140 from 125 on the news. He kept his buy rating on [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/).


In the near term, Apple is likely to have "a major holiday season" with its iPhone 12 series smartphones and other devices, Wedbush's Ives said.


Ahead of the holiday season, Apple refreshed practically its entire product lineup, including iPhones, iPad tablets, Mac computers and Apple Watch smartwatches. It also debuted premium over-ear headphones called [AirPods Max](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-airpods-max-introduction/) and a smaller smart speaker called the HomePod Mini.


Apple Stock Clears Early-Entry Buy Point

In morning trading Tuesday, Apple stock cleared an early-entry buy point of 125.49, based on [IBD chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/).

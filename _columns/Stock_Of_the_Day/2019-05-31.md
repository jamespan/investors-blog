**Carlisle Cos.** ([CSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSL)), which has delivered powerful earnings growth recently via its diversified model, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares find support at the 10-week moving average. Carlisle stock is showing impressive strength, even amid a troubled market.


The Scottsdale, Arizona-based midcap is a diversified firm that sells highly engineered and high margin products. Its offerings include commercial roofing, specialty tires, farm-machinery brakes and food service cookware.


It operates in four segments: Carlisle Construction Materials, which provides the bulk of its revenue, Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, Carlisle Fluid Technologies and Carlisle Brake & Friction.


Carlisle Construction Materials includes roofing and other products. Construction materials and builders have fared well in 2019, somewhat insulated from trade wars and benefiting from low interest rates.


Investors should largely avoid making new buys during a stock market correction, especially as the major averages continue to hit new lows. However it offers an opportunity to add names to your watch list, and Carlisle stock has built-in diversification while boasting a strong record on earnings. Carlisle stock has climbed 25% over the last 12 months.

Carlisle Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


Shares fell 2.7% to 133.31 on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), but are finding support at the 10-week line for the first time since breaking out decisively from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base last month. Carlisle stock is modestly extended from that 125.24 buy point.


Normally, a [rebound from the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) would offer a buying opportunity. But the M in CAN SLIM stands for Market, and the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) climate is not healthy.



Carlisle stock also looks to be forming a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), but would need one more week before that becomes valid.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) for Carlisle stock has been on an upward trend since the end of October. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Even as Carlisle stock has pulled back modestly in the market correction, the RS line has been hitting new highs.



Carlisle stock holds an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 92, which is just below the ideal score of 95 or above. However both Carlisle earnings and stock performance are impressive. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-carlisle-cos-inc-csl.aspx) shows Carlisle earnings have grown by an average 34% over the past three quarters, including 46% and 45% in the last two periods. (In both cases, Carlisle stock gapped up after earnings.) This is a big improvement on the three-year EPS growth rate of just 3%.


In addition Carlisle stock is leading the [Diversified Operations Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-may-30-2019/). Its 34% share price increase so far in 2019 puts it above heavy hitters such as **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) and Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)).


Big Money Backs Carlisle Stock
------------------------------


[CAN SLIM connoisseurs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) are always on the lookout for stocks with strong investment from big money backers. This is why the "I" in the acronym stands for Institutional Sponsorship.


Carlisle stock scores highly by this metric. In total, 48.5% of its shares are held by institutional investors. Vanguard and BlackRock are the two leading holders. Another noteworthy backer is AHRP CRM Mid Cap Value Fund, which is one of the best funds in its class, according to IBD research.


Analysts have tipped the firm for future growth due to its strength in the aerospace and defense markets. The outlook for its medical technology and satellite integration products is also seen as positive. Carlisle is continuing to seek growth opportunities, recently buying Petersen Aluminum to expand its construction materials segment's product offerings.

**Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the music and podcast streaming service focuses on improving its profitability. Meanwhile, Spotify stock could be forming a new base.




Spotify stock has climbed steadily since the music streamer posted a surprise profit in the [third quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-music-streamer-beats-q3-estimates/) and beat expectations for new subscribers and total listeners in the period.


In afternoon trades on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), Spotify stock rose 0.2% to close at 190.27. In a bullish sign, the stock has found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). A strong move off that line would offer an early entry for aggressive investors.


More cautious investors might want to wait for Spotify stock to form a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), which it appears to be doing.


Spotify Stock Gets Positive Reviews
-----------------------------------


Last week, Spotify scored a pair of bullish reports from Wall Street analysts.


Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upgraded Spotify stock to buy from hold. He also hiked his price target on the stock to 265 from 170.


Spotify's "renewed focus on financial discipline" was a key factor for the upgrade, Wlodarczak said in a client note. That focus should result in higher medium- and long-term adjusted earnings and free cash flow, he said.


"It appears that Spotify has won the digital audio streaming content war," Wlodarczak said. From its position of strength, Spotify should be able to raise prices without significant churn, he said.


Elsewhere, Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris reiterated his buy rating on Spotify stock with a price target of 220.


In a client note, Morris said he expects Spotify "to remain diligently focused on efficient operations and a path to stronger profit and free-cash-flow growth."


Beat-And-Raise Earnings Report

The [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) is **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)), which is hovering just below a buy point. Akamai is nearing the potential entry just after cloud services rival **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) moved into its own buy zone last week.




Akamai: IBD Stock Of The Day
----------------------------


The cloud-based internet content delivery provider is trading just below a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point of 77.69. The stock first tried to clear that level on May 22, but hit resistance and reversed lower.


The buy point for Akamai Technologies, which is in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, remains valid because the stock only fell as much as 3.5% from that level. A sell signal for the stock would be triggered at a 7%-8% loss.


Shares rose 1.4% to 77.07 in Monday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

Amazon Vs. Akamai
-----------------


Amazon, with its fast-growing Amazon Web Services unit, competes with Akamai in internet content delivery services. Amazon stock cleared a buy point of 1,617.54 on Wednesday. It eclipsed the old peak of 1,638.10 on Thursday, offering another entry point. Both moves came in light volume. Amazon climbed 1.45% Monday to 1,665.27, a new high.


Akamai's key customers include software stocks **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), as well as online brokerages **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)).


Look At Volume, RS Line On Breakout
-----------------------------------


If and when Akamai attempts a breakout, look for heavy volume on the upside as that indicates support from institutional investors. Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.


This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development. It provides a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock moves higher.


Akamai Stock Fundamentals
-------------------------


Akamai earns an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 91 out of 99. The Composite Rating includes a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance.


Last quarter, the company broke a streak of quarterly earnings declines, with growth of 22%. Akamai also saw its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The tech firm is expected to issue its next quarterly report near the end of June.


The Internet-Network Solutions industry group ranks No. 35 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks. Top stocks typically come from the top quartile of IBD's groups. It's key to focus not only on leading stocks, but leading stocks that come from leading industry groups.

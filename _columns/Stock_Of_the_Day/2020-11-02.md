**Sherwin Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the paint maker nears a buy point amid a surge in residential remodeling projects during the pandemic.




The increased activity has boosted earnings, and last week's Q3 report topped forecasts. Management also has lifted its full-year guidance twice in just over a month.


Company executives said interior home repaintings and new home purchases have fueled retail sales globally, which saw a 5.2% gain in Q3.





"Continued and unprecedented strength in our DIY business, solid demand across our residential repaint and new residential segments, and improving demand in our industrial coatings businesses and regions drove our strong third-quarter results," said Chairman and CEO John G. Morikis in an Oct. 27 earnings statement.

Sherwin-Williams Stock Analysis
-------------------------------


Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams, which operates more than 4,900 stores in the U.S. and Canada, expects the home-improvement trend to continue to spur growth in the fourth quarter and into 2021.


Sherwin-Williams stock is on the IBD [Long Term Leaders watchlist](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), a list of some of the best long-term stocks to buy and watch right now, based on factors including earnings stability as well as solid growth and price performance.


Shares rallied 3.1% to close at 709.30 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), closing in on a 726.01 buy point off a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/).


Its relative strength line hit a new high. Meanwhile, shares popped above their 50-day line, a bullish sign that is generally actionable in a market uptrend, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


More aggressive investors could see the gap-up above the 50-day line as actionable, but with the market in a correction, stock buying is very risky. A [market in correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-stock-market-sell-off-election-day-apple-tesla-rival-nio-deliveries/) generally means investors should avoid new purchases.


Sherwin-Williams stock has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 94 and a Composite Rating of 92. It is a member of IBD's Chemicals-Paints group.

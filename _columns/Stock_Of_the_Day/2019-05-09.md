**Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), is showing a true character change. Shares vaulted 28% and marked an all-time high of 83.35 Thursday. The strong move also marked a [new breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) at 74.45 on the heels of a [bullish first-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q1-2019-roku-stock/).




In a breakout, a stock aiming to become a true market leader should see share volume soar. Roku hits the mark.


Amid Thursday's wild trading session on Wall Street, 56.4 million Roku shares exchanged hands. That turned out to exceed the stock's usual pace over the past 50 sessions by 366%.


Roku has a float of 81 million shares.


The [correct buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) in Roku goes up to 5% past 74.45, or 78.17.


The tech and media entertainment play moved out of the [proper buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). At this point, it makes sense to keep watching the stock for a normal pullback into the buy range. Such chances are not low. After all, Roku has now soared 55% in the space of three weeks.


IBD Stock Of The Day: A Complex Chart Pattern
---------------------------------------------



The recent chart action in Roku offers two primary interpretations. They lead to the same [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/inv).


The first interpretation: One could view the base as simply a jagged cup base. With no handle formed, take the left-side peak of 74.35 and add 10 cents. That gets you the 74.45 proper buy point in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).


The second interpretation: Roku built an extremely large and deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The handle's high of 74.35, plus 10 cents, gives a 74.45 entry.


A third interpretation offers a lower alternate buy point.



From its decline on March 12 through Wednesday, Roku formed a base that shows [distinct elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The middle peak of 71.30 between the two sell-offs produced an early entry of 71.40 — a dime above the 71.30 intraday high.


A [good double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) must be a minimum seven weeks long. Roku's base stretched nearly nine weeks.


The expert in technology, software and hardware for video streaming on TVs is showing a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) that's hit new highs. That's bullish.

CAN SLIM Fundamentals
---------------------


Roku went public at 14 a share in September 2017. Now ranked No. 1 in smart TV deployments in the U.S. in the past quarter, the company has a mixed record on the bottom line.


In Q3 of last year, the midcap firm lost 9 cents a share; in Q4, the bottom line vaulted to earnings of 5 cents a share. And in the latest quarter, the net loss grew to 9 cents a share vs. a 7-cent loss in the year-ago quarter.


However, institutional investors apparently like Roku's ability to continually grow revenue at a superb rate.


The top line has now bolted 28%, 36%, 57%, 39%, 46% and 51% vs. year- ago levels in the past six quarters.


Roku has zero long-term debt.


Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in Q1 reversed to $10 million, up from negative EBITDA of $800,000 a year ago.


The I In CAN SLIM Stands For Institutions; How Does Roku Fare?

Roku is certainly attracting more holders in the [institutional crowd](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares together grew to a combined 282 funds and 36.2 million shares owned as of the first quarter of 2019, up from 196 funds and 30 million shares in Q2 of 2018.


Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX), which gets an A+ rating from IBD for 36-month performance, added to its stake in Q1 to 4.4 million shares, according to data from IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co.

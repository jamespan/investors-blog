**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the information-technology services firm rebounds from the coronavirus lockdown, which impacted its customers in the travel and consumer sectors. Epam stock has moved into a buy zone while analysts look for it to recover as businesses start spending on digital transformation projects.




Newtown, Pa.-based Epam stock perked up after it reported first-quarter earnings and revenue on May 7 that came in above estimates amid lowered expectations. Epam on May 28 forged a new [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 235.13 from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) chart pattern.


It's now in a buy zone, though investors should monitor how trading volume holds up. The stock generally trades in lower volume than more-liquid peers like **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)).


After gaining some 86% in 2019, Epam stock got off to a good start this year. Shares rose another 13% before the Covid-19 outbreak sent stock markets down in February and March. Epam stock surged 6.2% to 238.29 in recent action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

Epam Stock: Relative Strength Rating
------------------------------------


On April 9, the company withdrew its 2020 forecasts. It wasn't alone among information technology services companies. **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) and **Infosys** ([INFY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFY)) suspended their forecasts amid economic uncertainty.


Even so, IBD's Computer-Tech Services group has held up better than some. It now [ranks No. 77 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-04-2020/) tracked by IBD, with No. 1 tops.


Epam owns a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 80 out of a possible 99. Some other stocks hold higher ratings in the group, such as **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) (93) and **Sapiens International** ([SPNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPNS)) (91), according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/).


But Epam's Relative Strength Rating is respectable at 80.


Epam gets about 19% of revenue from the travel and consumer sectors. Customers include airlines and hotels. Those industries were hard hit by the coronavirus lockdown.


However, Epam also has a number of clients in the financial services industry, including European banks. Epam more recently has been targeting the life science, oil-and-gas and automotive industries.


Digital Transformation Projects Still A Priority?
-------------------------------------------------


As the economies bounce back from the Covid-19 crisis, William Blair analyst Maggie Nolan says "[digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/)" projects will remain a "logical area of spending."


Those include customer service initiatives like chatbots, turning paperwork into electronic records, automating business workflows and data analytics. One of Epam's clients is **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google's cloud computing services.


Epam specializes in custom software development and platform engineering services. The company hires most of its computer software developers in Eastern Europe, with most of its offshore centers in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Hungary.


In addition, Epam aims to retain its computer engineers amid the Covid-19 crisis.


Epam Stock: Retaining Engineers A Goal
--------------------------------------


"In what is emerging as a consistent theme across the industry, Epam is focused on the long-term health and opportunity for the business and therefore minimizing disruption to its talent base while balancing controlling costs, including labor costs," Nolan said in a recent note to clients.


She added: "Epam expects a post-virus world where its core digital services are in even higher demand."


Also, the company has expanded into higher-margin consulting services through acquisitions.


In addition, Epam's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) has improved to B-, according to IBD Stock Checkup.


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

Warren Buffett-backed IPO stock **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). StoneCo stock broke out past a buy point as the Brazilian payments firm benefits from a weaker dollar.




The U.S. dollar index soared to a nearly 17-year high of 102.82 on March 20, but is now sitting at 96.58. A falling dollar means StoneCo earnings will look bigger when converted from Brazilian reals.


StoneCo targets small and midsize businesses in Brazil. It has been snapping up businesses thanks to its StoneHub strategy. These hubs are StoneCo's distribution solution. It has hubs near customers that each include an integrated team of sales, service, and operations support staff.


But while the dollar is showing signs of weakness, OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya warned it is still in an uncertain position.


"The world is welcoming the softer dollar right now, but a complete rout is far from happening until investors are convinced that developing nations have the coronavirus under control," he said in a research note.


Coronavirus cases have risen sharply in Brazil and in several other Latin American countries.

StoneCo Stock Hits Buy Zone
---------------------------


Shares rallied 4.7% to 41.55 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). StoneCo stock is now above a cup-with-handle [buy point](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) of 40.27, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The cup-with-handle base is very deep — 62% — which is not ideal. However, a number of economically sensitive growth stocks plunged during the market crash and have bounced back in the market rally on recovery hopes.


StoneCo stock is now way above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) and its 200-day line. In addition, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is looking bullish, and is moving toward consolidation highs.


StoneCo stock has an [IBD Composite Rating of 81](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of a best-possible 99. Earnings are weighing down its score, though the IPO stock is profitable. The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-stoneco-ltd-cl-a-stne.aspx) showed StoneCo earnings growth averaged 239% over the past three years. This is well above the [25% growth sought by CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). It has slowed to a still very healthy average of 49% EPS growth over the past three quarters.


StoneCo earnings are expected to fall sharply in 2020 as Brazil struggles with a severe coronavirus recession.


Last month, StoneCo got a big boost on an upbeat report, even though it missed earnings views. Total payments volume (TPV) grew 42.1%. Total active clients soared 74% to 531,300.


Economic activity also started rebounding in April and May. StoneCo's TPV grew 9% in April vs. a year ago and around 23% until May 23, with the company seeing stronger growth ahead in the second half of the year.



Rival Brazilian payments stock **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) advanced 1%, working toward its own buy point.


**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) climbed 1.5%, **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) rose 0.8% and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) edged down 2 cents. Visa stock and Mastercard stock are near buy points too.


Brazil Offers These Opportunities
---------------------------------


There are deeper reasons to own StoneCo stock than favorable currency conditions. StoneCo President Augusto Lins told Investor's Business Daily there are important changes underway in Brazil that makes the country a good opportunity for payments players.


"We are very enthusiastic about the future and the prospects of the industry in Brazil. The Brazilian central bank is discussing (the launch of) an instant payments solution (called) PIX," he said. "We are in the midst of implementing the open banking system as seen in the UK and we are also putting in place the register of credit card receivables in order to liberate receivables of credit cards and that is an additional opportunity for credit."


The Brazilian banking system is dominated by its 'Big Five' banks — Banco do Brasil, Itau, Caixa, Bradesco and Santander. But there is a big effort underway by regulators to make it more competitive.


StoneCo said it is focused on becoming the leader in offering payments solutions to small and midsize businesses in Brazil. Management believes there is plenty of room for both it and PagSeguro Digital, as the latter focuses more on micro-merchants, while its primary focus is on SMBs.


Lins did not rule out expansion outside of Brazil, noting the payments business is global, but he said they are wholly focused on Brazil at the moment.


He has deep experience in the Brazilian payments space. Lin is a former executive director and board member at Itau Unibanco, which is the biggest Latin American bank by assets and market capitalization. He also holds a senior position at privately-held payments firm Redecard.


Warren Buffett Backs StoneCo
----------------------------


One of the key considerations for a CAN SLIM stock is the I, which stands for Institutional Sponsorship. Here StoneCo scores highly, with an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, on a A-E scale. Think of C as neutral. In total, 53% of its stock is owned by big money.


Warren Buffett is a noted backer. His firm **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) holds 14.17 million shares, which accounts for 8% of all StoneCo stock.


But Berkshire is only the third top institutional holder. The top spot belongs to T. Rowe Price, which holds 31.91 million shares. Its highly regarded New Horizons fund is among those that have a stake.

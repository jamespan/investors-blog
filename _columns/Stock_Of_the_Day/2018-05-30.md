**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/): The robot surgery pioneer is showing resilience despite stock market volatility.




The S&P 500 index component is worth keeping a close eye on as it nears buy point from a rare base-on-base-on-base chart pattern.


A breakout from a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) can be powerful, especially when the market is struggling. A base-on-base pattern in a choppy trading environment shows that a stock has held a recent breakout and won't give back those gains, but instead sets up again.


Intuitive Surgical has formed a third [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) on the trot, and is working on a 473.89 entry. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500, is also near an all-time high.

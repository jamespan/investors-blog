Luckin Coffee stock is moving in huge volume Monday, on track for its heaviest day since at least its May 17 IPO trading debut.


Last week Luckin Coffee stock exploded for a 46% gain in record weekly volume, fueled by the quarterly results.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has rebounded right to record highs, signaling Luckin Coffee stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index.


Luckin Coffee stock has a poor [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 53. This reflects the IPO stock's losses, reflected in its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of just 9.



Stock Of The Day Eyes 'Underpenetrated Market'
----------------------------------------------


The chain tries to use mobile ordering, small stores and big data to serve customers quickly in what it has called a "100% cashier-less environment."


Management, during its conference call in August, called China's coffee market "highly underpenetrated" and said it had "significantly increased mass market consumption for coffee."


But Luckin competes against smaller shops selling tea — long the hot beverage of choice in China — and Starbucks. And it has lost money as it grows at a torrid pace, promotes itself and tries to educate consumers about coffee consumption.


Luckin has also launched Luckin Tea and plans to set up a joint venture with Louis Dreyfus Co., which processes agricultural goods, to develop a Luckin Juice business.


Luckin Coffee Stock Faces Big Rival
-----------------------------------


Luckin wants to have more than 4,500 stores by the end of 2019, aiming to pass Starbucks. The U.S. coffee giant had 4,125 stores in China as of the end of its most recently reported quarter.


China plays a massive role in Starbucks' current growth strategy, and it is one of two targeted long-term growth markets, CEO Kevin Johnson previously said, with the other being the U.S.


Starbucks is opening 600 stores in China this year, or one every 15 hours.


The company has banked on China to boost sales, scaling up its digital ordering and delivery capacity to compete. In September Starbucks said it's teaming up with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) to offer Chinese customers smart speaker voice ordering and delivery.


Starbucks stock edged down 0.2% to 84.02. Shares are holding support just above their 200-day average, slightly above the falling 50-day line.

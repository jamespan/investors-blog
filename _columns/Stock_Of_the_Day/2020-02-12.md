Recent IPO **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). While Progyny stock has been on a bumpy ride since its debut, gains this week appear to have broken past some resistance.




The fertility benefits manager connects employees to services that can help them achieve pregnancy. [As IBD reported in December](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/progyny-stock-ipo-fertililty-treatment/), the company hopes to benefit from a broader trend of people waiting longer to have children, as well as more same-sex couples and single mothers wanting to have them.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google are among its biggest customers. However, Progyny faces competition from startups.


Progyny Stock
-------------


Progyny stock swung 10.7% higher to close at 34.28 on the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) and continued to springboard off its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The advance adds to gains made on Monday and Tuesday. The move came amid a broader rally in health care stocks.


Wednesday's sprint upward for Progyny stock follows a nearly monthlong downtrend, after shares reached a high of 35.43 on Jan. 14. Investors could interpret that high as the aforementioned resistance barrier.


Aggressive investors could see a rebound off the pullback to the 50-day average and the break past recent resistance as a buy signal, IBD's research suggests.

Beware Recent History
---------------------


[Progyny stock was also an IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/progyny-stock-nears-buy-point-profitable-ipo/) in January and [in November](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/progyny-stock-profitable-ipo-near-buy-point/). But given the jagged — albeit short — history of Progyny's chart action, investors might consider buying cautiously and taking a smaller position to limit their exposure.


In particular, shares have had two breakouts fail and have seen overall choppiness, as is often the case with recent IPOs.


Progyny stock debuted in late October after the IPO priced at 13 a share and quickly settled into an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) in November with a 29.39 entry. In its first earnings report as a public company, [earnings beat forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/progyny-stock-progyny-earnings-q3-2019-ipo-base-buy-point/) on Dec. 4. Shares then cleared the buy point on Dec. 6, but began a two-week slump the very next day.


Last month, Progyny stock began working toward a 32.10 buy point off a short consolidation. Shares cleared that entry Jan. 14. But again, the stock lost that buy point the very next day and began another slump.


Progyny stock has a 65 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) is 23. IBD generally recommends that investors focus on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s.


Industry Group
--------------


Progyny stock is in IBD's managed-care industry group, which Wednesday was broadly rallying. The reason could be Sen. Bernie Sanders' win in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night.


While he is a strong backer of "Medicare for All," which could essentially eliminate private health insurers, his status as the Democratic front-runner appears to be raising the odds that President Donald Trump will win reelection, easing stock market fears that the health sector will be upended.


Meanwhile, signs that the China coronavirus outbreak is slowing are fueling an overall stock market rally while also potentially taking some pressure off health stocks that might have seen higher costs if the outbreak gained momentum.


Among other managed-care stocks, **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)) jumped 5.75%, **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) rallied 4.7%, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) surged 4.4%, and **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) gained 4.4%.

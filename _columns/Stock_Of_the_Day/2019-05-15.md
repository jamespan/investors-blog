**Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the medical devices company knocked its first-quarter results out of the park. Now, Tandem stock is approaching a breakout.




In midday trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Tandem [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) jumped 3.5% to close at 68.18 in below-average [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-much-volume-should-a-stock-have/).

"We think it likely Tandem can become the industry leader over the next several years," Lake Street Capital Markets analyst Brooks O'Neil said in a recent report to clients.


Changing The Diabetes Treatment Paradigm
----------------------------------------


Tandem makes insulin pumps for [diabetes treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-device-companies-ignite-revolution-diabetes-treatment/). These body-worn medical devices steadily deliver insulin to diabetics whose patients don't produce enough — or any — of the hormone. This deficiency can put them in danger of harmful spikes in blood sugar.


The medical devices company is benefiting from the growing number of type 1 diabetics, he said. There are an estimated 40 million type 1 diabetics worldwide. Due to a genetic defect, these patients are reliant on outside sources of insulin.


About half of all type 1 diabetics rely on a staple in traditional diabetes treatment: multiple daily injections of insulin, O'Neil said. So, medical device makers like Tandem, **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) and **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) have a huge potential market in front of them.


O'Neil has a buy rating and 100 price target on Tandem stock. He also owns Tandem stock.


Craig Hallum analyst Alexander Nowak expects Tandem's market share to grow. Currently, Medtronic leads the insulin pump market.


"An important datapoint that came up on the (first-quarter earnings) call (is) that 45% of new pumps sold are Tandem's, despite Tandem only having 14% share in the market today," he said in his recent note to clients. "This indicates Tandem's share is poised to move much higher."


Pairing With Other Medical Device Companies
-------------------------------------------


Tandem is winning business by partnering with other medical device companies. Its line of insulin pumps can be paired with medical devices called [continuous glucose monitors](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/diabetes-treatment-dexcom-stock/), or CGMs. **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) and Medtronic make CGMs.


Already, Tandem pairs its insulin pumps with Dexcom's CGM. This new mashup of medical devices takes the place of finger sticks and insulin shots in diabetes treatment, automating insulin delivery to prevent dangerous spikes in blood sugar.


"These innovative products will keep diabetes 'in range,' or driving down the center lane, in ways that will help them live like people with a fully functioning pancreas and minimize the significant and costly complications of this disease," Lake Street's O'Neil said.



Notably, Tandem also has a series of new medical devices coming to the forefront. Its next insulin pump will be capable of controlling low and high blood sugar levels. Medical devices today can only control insulin delivery when glucose levels fall too low.


Oppenheimer analyst Steven Lichtman also noted Tandem is preparing to launch a smaller insulin pump in 2020 that can be controlled by a smartphone. This "remains a long-term upside driver," he said in a report.


Tandem Stock Pops On Sales Beat
-------------------------------


In the first quarter, [Tandem demolished estimates](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190430005919/en/Tandem-Diabetes-Care-Announces-Quarter-2019-Financial) with $66 million in sales, popping 142% year over year. The Street expected Tandem to report $47.5 million, Oppenheimer analyst Lichtman said. Further, U.S. insulin pump shipments jumped 118%.


That was Tandem Diabetes' fifth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth.


Lichtman has an outperform rating and an 80 price target on Tandem stock.


The medical devices company also raised its sales outlook for 2019 to $300 million to $315 million, up from $255 million to $270 million.


"With the explosive start to 2019 in a seasonally low quarter, still limited market share and no change in international, we believe guidance is likely conservative," Craig Hallum's Nowak said. He sees at least $350 million and $400 million in 2019, 2020 sales, respectively.


Growth drivers include continued share gains from Medtronic and the exit of **Johnson & Johnson**'s ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) Animas unit from the [insulin pump market](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/blog/post/general/2017/10/05/our-response-to-animas-exit-from-the-insulin-pump-market). Although J&J designated Medtronic as the preferred partner to transition customers, Tandem is still gaining, Nowak said.


Nowak kept his buy rating and 84 price target on Tandem stock.

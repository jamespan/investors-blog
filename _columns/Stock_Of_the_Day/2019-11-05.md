**Sleep Number** ([SNBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNBR)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Sleep Number stock is setting up in a buy point amid strong earnings growth for the maker of adjustable and smartphone-connected mattresses. Rival Tempur Sealy stock recently broke out and is hovering at the top of a buy zone.




Sleep Number Stock Sets Up
--------------------------


Sleep Number stock is in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 50.10 buy point. Shares rose 1.1% to 48.64 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). Sleep Number stock has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a measure of accelerating profit, is also strong, at 95.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Sleep Number stock, which gauges performance against the S&P 500, is not far from April's six-year high. But the RS line has been chippy and hasn't really made progress over that.


Similarly, Sleep Number earnings growth for the company has been choppy. In the last four quarters, Sleep Number earnings shot up 145%, 54%, 400% and 81%, but a lot of that had to do with easy comparisons. Analysts expect a 9% EPS decline for the current quarter.


During its most recent quarter, [Sleep Number earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/snbr-stock-sleep-number-earnings-q3-2019-tempur-sealy-buy-point/) topped expectations. Sales growth accelerated slightly for a second straight quarter, to 14%. The company also raised its full-year profit outlook.


Sleep Number stock had a wild session after earnings, surging as high as 50 and as low as 44.12 on Oct. 16, finally settling for a 0.1% decline at 46.80.


Connected Beds
--------------


Management attributed its recent growth to marketing efforts over Labor Day and the NFL season. Efforts to digitize and otherwise improve its supply chain helped profits and cushion the blow against tariffs.


Management also said customer satisfaction with its 360 smart bed was at "record levels." Those sensor-laced beds can detect bodily movements during sleep and adjust the mattress accordingly. The mattresses also contain temperature controls. A smartphone app also tallies the sleeper's sleep times, heart and breathing rates, and grades their sleep quality.


Prices for those mattresses, on Sleep Number's website, range anywhere from $599 to $5,700, depending on size and features.


Tempur Sealy Stock In Buy Zone
------------------------------


In recent years, cheaper, bed-in-a-box mattresses that can be ordered online have upended the mattress-retail world.


But companies like **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)), which makes Tempur-Pedic and Sealy beds, have also had better luck growing sales with higher-priced mattresses and retail outlets geared toward customers willing to pay more. That strategy — along with a reconciliation with retailer Mattress Firm, once a big customer — helped [send Tempur Sealy stock higher](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/tempur-sealy-stock-wakes-deal-mattress-firm/) this year.


Tempur Sealy broke out past an 81.95 buy point from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) on Oct. 17. Shares then traded around that entry for several sessions. Tempur Sealy stock then spiked 11% on Oct. 31. That followed better-than-expected Tempur Sealy earnings, with sales growth accelerating for a seven straight quarter, from -18% to +13%. The company also raised its financial outlook.


Tempur Sealy stock has pulled back since then. On Tuesday, shares slipped 0.5% to to 85.99, just within the 5% chase zone.


Similar to Sleep Number, Tempur Sealy offers high-tech beds. But CEO Scott Thompson, in an interview last month, said he expected the company's connected bed business to remain small, and supported by early adopters. The lion's share of his business, he said, would still be in beds priced under $1,000.


"I think for the people who want this technology, need this technology, early adopters, it's a very meaningful product for them," he said.


Sleep Number stock is the No. 2 stock in the Retail-Home Furnishings group, which is No. 3 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Upscale home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is No. 1 in the group. Tempur Sealy stock is a leading stock in the Household and Office Furniture group, which is rated No. 14.

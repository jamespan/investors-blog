New Oriental Education Stock Analysis
-------------------------------------


Shares rose 3% to 116.29 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), hitting a record 117.41 intraday. EDU stock [cleared a 115.98 buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after flirting with a breakout in the prior two sessions.


New Oriental Education stock is trying to break out from a [rare ascending base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/aol-stock-market-investing-chart-base-pattern/). This is a hard pattern to find for chart readers. However it is also one of the most coveted, as it is among the most powerful of all chart structures. The ascending base often appears when a top stock is fighting a headwind from a hostile broad market. The recent choppy market certainly fulfills this requirement.


New Oriental Education stock is looking like a bull in a China shop. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been spiking higher since late November, recently hitting new highs.



New Oriental Education Earnings Loom
------------------------------------


However, New Oriental Education earnings for fiscal Q1 2020 are due next week. Investor's Business Daily advocates [using options as a strategy to reduce risk around earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/). It's a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move when it announces earnings, while reducing the downside risk.


The China stock has a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating of 98](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-new-orientl-eduandtech-ads-edu.aspx). The Stock Checkup Tool shows New Oriental Education earnings are strong, but not quite on par with its price performance.


New Oriental's earnings have grown by an average 28% over the past three quarters, better than the three-year growth rate of 20%. The [CAN SLIM cognoscenti look for growth of 25% in both these metrics](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). However earnings have been decelerating for the past two quarters in succession.  




But analysts expect New Oriental Education earnings to show faster growth — 18% — for fiscal Q1, with a robust 32% gain in 2020 and 31% in 2021.


Other Chinese Education Stocks
------------------------------


**TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) rose 3.5% to 39.47, closing in on a cup-base buy point of 39.76. But unlike New Oriental, TAL Education earnings tumbled 79% in the latest quarter and are expected to fall 44% in the next quarter.


**GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)), an online-only Chinese education stock that came public at 10.50 a share in early June, fell 2.1% to 14.01. GSX stock is working on a 17.64 buy point, but is currently just holding support at its 50-day line.


Analyst Bullish On China Stock
------------------------------


Goldman Sachs analyst Christine Cho rates New Oriental Education stock as a buy with a 135 target. She was especially encouraged with how management communicated their future plans to her during a recent engagement.


"We walked away from our meetings with EDU's senior management team with continued confidence on the company," she said in a Sept. 6 research note. "We believe EDU's newer learning centers added in the last two years are approaching an accelerated ramp-up curve in FY20."


Cho also said she believes the firm's focus on making operating efficiency gains will deliver even more important benefits to the bottom line in the future.

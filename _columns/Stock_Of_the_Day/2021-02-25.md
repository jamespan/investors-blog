Five Below Earnings
-------------------


On key fundamental metrics, Five Below scores reasonably well. It earns an EPS Rating of 88 out of 99. Earnings per share doubled in Q3, well above the three-year average of 3%. Sales growth came in at 26%, also above the three-year average of 15%.


Q4 results are likely due next month, and analysts expect EPS to climb 7.6% as sales jump 24.8%.


A CAN SLIM investor generally would want to see both quarterly and annual EPS growth above 25% [in a top growth stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). However, huge beats in the latest two quarters, which saw both earnings and sales growth accelerate, promise well for Five Below stock.


In March 2020, Five Below shut all of its stores nationwide due to the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), Five Below doesn't offer groceries and so was not considered an essential retailer that could stay open.


Customer visits cratered 93% from 2019 levels in April of last year. Five Below began reopening stores in May and went on to open 120 net new stores, ending 2020 with 1,020 stores.

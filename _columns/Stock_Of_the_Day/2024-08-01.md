Itron stock is benefiting from national infrastructure investments as well.




The company provides hardware and software solutions, as well as services, to help utilities and cities manage energy and water. It helps electric-vehicle fleets manage their business.


Further, it touts opportunities from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Similar policies around the world are helping to drive growth, the company says.

Itron Stock Breakout Comes With Risk
------------------------------------


Shares punched up 4.5% to 108.09 in big volume on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Itron stock burst out of a cup-with-handle base with a 108.04 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/), according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) pattern recognition. It struck a record high 113.07 intraday before paring gains amid a market retreat.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) for Itron stock is trending higher, clearing short-term levels. However, it remains below the consolidation peak as the stock breaks out.


The current pattern is the second third-stage base, so investors should use some caution as Itron shares break out again to fresh highs. A [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/late-stage-base-should-be-avoided/) tends to reduce the odds of a successful breakout.


Among other favorable technical signs, Itron stock is holding above all the shorter-term and longer-term moving averages.

Itron stock shows a 91 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating means that this infrastructure play has outperformed 91% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.


Year to date, Itron stock has soared 45%, fueled by an earnings breakaway gap in late February.

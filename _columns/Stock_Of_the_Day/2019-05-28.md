**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day,](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) continuing to hold key support near record highs amid strong growth and big expansion plans. Lululemon stock rose Tuesday, setting up potential buy points.




While investors should largely avoid making new buys during a stock market correction, it is a ripe time for sizing up names to put on your watch list. The upmarket yogawear maker is a prime candidate, as Lululemon stock is flashing bullish technical signals despite the downward pressure.


Lululemon earnings growth has been powerful in recent quarters, benefiting from the ongoing athleisure trend, a boost in digital sales and expanding into men's clothing. In addition the Canada-based retailer is in the midst of a major global expansion from its North America base, with China seen as a key opportunity.


Lululemon Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------


Shares of the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/) member rose 0.45% to 173.55 on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Lululemon stock is slightly extended from a 158.77 buy point.


Lululemon stock has been holding support at its 10-week line, trading tightly in recent weeks amid the stock market correction.


A rebound from the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/10-week-moving-average-serves-multiple-purposes/), the weekly chart counterpart to the 50-day moving average, could offer an opportunity for existing holders to add shares or aggressive investors to step in.


Meanwhile, Lululemon stock is more than four weeks into a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) that would offer a new buy point of 179.50, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is already at an all-time high, a bullish sign. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, shows Lululemon stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



Lululemon Earnings Growth Powerful
----------------------------------


Lululemon stock has a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 96, and it boasts rock-solid fundamentals. The Stock Checkup Tool shows Lululemon's earnings have grown by an average 51% over the past three quarters. Longer-term, Lululemon EPS has grown a muscular 27% over the last three years. Sales are not quite as strong, growing by 16% over the past three years. But Lululemon revenue swelled 26% in the latest quarter, the best gain in several years.


Stretching All Over The World
-----------------------------


There is still plenty of room for growth for the yogawear maker, with more overseas expansion ahead — notably in the lucrative Chinese market. Chief Executive Calvin McDonald shared some insight during the firm's fourth-quarter earnings call in late March.


At the end of fiscal 2018, Lululemon had 440 company-operated stores. But the U.S. and Canada accounted for 349. China is only its fourth-biggest territory, with its 22 stores lagging Australia's 29.

"We are planning to open more new doors this year in the 40 to 50 range, with China picking up a disproportionate number of those incremental doors," he said, referring to planned new store openings. "So overall, the amount of incremental square footage is in the midteen growth range, which is up from 2018."


But there is much more to Lululemon stock than just its overseas strategy. While Lululemon still refers to its trademark stretchy pants as its "growth pillar," it is expanding into other areas. This is key for [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), as the N in the acronym stands for new products.


Legendary stock trader William J. O'Neil, who founded Investor's Business Daily, believes a strong pipeline of new products is a key component of a winning stock.


Lululemon Makes A Grab For Bra Share
------------------------------------


During its recent analyst day [Chief Product Officer Sun Choe promised](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-analyst-day-earnings-forecast-china-lululemon-stock/) there is much more to come. Management has touted how the firm is expanding its womenswear into office, travel, commute and outerwear as well as a wider bra assortment.


Choe believes bras offer a massive opportunity for Lululemon, telling analysts sales of "bras will become as big as pants in years to come." A key to this will be her team succeeding in its heady quest to "personalize women's breast movement."


Lululemon also sees a big expansion of its men's offerings. COO Stuart Haselden previously touted the success of pants and outwear in the men's business, and predicted Lululemon can be a "dual-gender brand," with a men's business as big as the women's side.

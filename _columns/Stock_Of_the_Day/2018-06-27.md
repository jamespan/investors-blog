**EOG** **Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the shale oil producer nearing a buy point amid reports of tightening crude oil stocks.







The firm has been dubbed the "**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) of oil" due to its use of technology to aid operations since breaking away from Enron in 1999. It has impressed analysts with its use of big data to aid in drilling operations. The firm holds prime positions in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian formations. It is also the country's biggest shale oil producer.


On the charts, the stock is forming a bullish [base-on-base move](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/base-on-base-breakout-yield-big-gains/). The base-on-base pattern can be very profitable, since the formation usually occurs among the strongest stocks during a market correction.


EOG shares jumped 3.55% to finish at 123.93 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/) as crude prices rallied. The stock looks set to strike a new buy point of 128.13 after forming a six-week flat base, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). This comes hot on the heels of the stock forming a 13-week cup base.


While other top shale stocks like **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) are nearing their own buy points too, EOG has better institutional sponsorship and a tighter base.

EOG also is the leading shale oil producer in the Eagle Ford formation in south Texas. While the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico is the bigger shale area with the most activity, a lack of pipelines means producers are having trouble getting oil to market and have been selling oil at a discount. But the Eagle Ford is closer to shipping points on the Gulf Coast.


EOG's fundamentals are just shy of being among the best stocks, which is reflected in the firm's [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 92. Winning stocks often have a 95 or higher score in the early stages of a new price run.


However it has an excellent [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 82, which measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months. The Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group is also performing well, and currently holds a [Group Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/industry-group-relative-strength-letter-rating-(group-rs)) of A+.



Stock Of The Day Innovates
--------------------------


The Houston-based company previously impressed by posting a loss in only one year during the three-year oil glut. In addition, it held its debt-to-equity ratio to a modest 38%. Among E&Ps with market capitalization above $10 billion, that combination was only equaled by **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)).


Company management has previously boasted about its development of smartphone apps and its massive haul of data to aid drilling.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Snapchat** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) are far from the most valuable apps on EOG workers' iPhones. Instead, the company has developed 20 mobile apps of its own that allow workers to stay connected day and night.

Ares stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the global investment manager rises near a buy point after smashing fourth-quarter views on the back of rising demand for alternative investments.




On Feb. 11, **Ares Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)) handily beat earnings and revenue estimates for the December quarter. Key financial metrics — including assets under management (AUM), fee-related earnings and after-tax realized income — all rose more than 50% year over year.


"Both institutional and retail investors are seeing the benefits of the higher returns and lower volatility that we generate with our alternative investments," said Ares CEO Michael Arougheti in an earnings release.


In what Arougheti called a "transformational year," the company topped $300 billion in AUM for the first time in 2021, also acquiring Landmark Partners and Black Creek Group.


Founded in 1997, Los Angeles-based Ares offers products and services across the credit, private equity, real estate and infrastructure asset classes. Far-larger rival **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) watchlist, a curated list of stocks with the most potential for big gains.


Alternative investments help to diversify portfolios and reduce investing risk. They're often used by high-net-worth individuals.


Investors should be very cautious about buying stocks in the current volatile market. But it's a good time to be building watchlists.

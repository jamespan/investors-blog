**Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the leading growth stock forms a new base pattern near all-time highs. Planet Fitness stock, an [IBD 50 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), pulled back sharply Monday amid broad-market losses, dipping below the key 50-day line.




Planet Fitness has thrived by offering low-fee and no mirrors in its "judgment free" gyms.


Planet Fitness Stock Action
---------------------------


After attempting a breakout over an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) on earnings in August, Planet Fitness stock began sputtering sideways. With that action, Planet Fitness stock is now shaping a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 53.51 buy point. Shares fell 4% to 49.57 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


When a stock strings together two separate bases, it's called a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/). Quality growth stocks can have successful breakouts from base-on-base patterns, and this IBD 50 stock could be setting up an ideal entry. The new base's low is only slightly slipping into the prior base, which is what you want to see.



Stock Of The Day: Planet Fitness Faces Fitness Test
---------------------------------------------------


With Monday's retreat, Planet Fitness is testing its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/) for the first time since early June. See if the Stock Of The Day can find support at this level. And look for the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/chart-contents/), which measures performance vs. the S&P 500, to move higher. If the RS line hits a new high as a stock breaks out, that's a bullish indicator.


This marks the fourth base pattern, and therefore a buying opportunity, for Planet Fitness stock in 2018. The fitness-center operator has risen some 43% so far this year amid [accelerating earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/).


Planet Fitness Earnings And Revenue Growth
------------------------------------------


Planet Fitness earnings growth has come in at 19%, 20%, 42%, and 55% over the past four quarters. One of the hallmark traits of top growth stocks is accelerating earnings growth. That helps Planet Fitness stock earn a coveted spot on the [IBD 50 list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) of leading stocks.


Revenue growth also has been strong, at 33% and 31% in the last two quarters, up from gains in the midteens in the prior three quarters.

**Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) It is setting up once again, rebounding from key support and closing in an early entry. Earnings and revenue growth have been picking up in recent quarters.


Meanwhile, several other restaurant chains are in or near buy points, including **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).




Dallas-based Wingstop has 1,959 locations as of the end of last year, including 1,721 in the U.S. Nearly all are franchised. In Q4, Wingstop opened a net 61 locations.


The wings specialist, focusing on takeout and delivery, has boomed since its 2015 IPO.


In the fourth quarter, Wingstop earnings per share swelled 150% as revenue spiked 46%, both accelerating for a third straight quarter. Analysts expect EPS growth to slow to 3% in 2023 with a 21% gain in 2023.

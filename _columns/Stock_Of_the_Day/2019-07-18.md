The Ventura, Calif.-based company plans to report [second-quarter earnings](http://investors.thetradedesk.com/events/event-details/q2-2019-trade-desk-earnings-conference-call) on Aug. 8. However, the last time Trade Desk reported earnings its stock tumbled 15%.

Trade Desk No. 2 Behind Google
------------------------------


Trade Desk's automated buying tools, a type of programmatic advertising, enable customers to buy online and mobile ads. Use of programmatic advertising is increasing in internet TV ad purchases.


In addition, Trade Desk helps clients leverage online consumer data to improve their targeted advertising.


Trade Desk is the No. 2 player in providing programmatic ad tools behind Alphabet-unit **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), says Pivotal Research Group analyst Michael Levine. Its customers include mega-agencies Publicis Groupe and WPP.


Trade Desk Stock Up 165% In 12 Months
-------------------------------------


"Trade Desk has been effective building the strongest independent offering in the market, and has been able to garner significant market share within the ad agency holding companies," Levine said while initiating coverage on May 29.


"It feels like the market is increasingly consolidating around Google as the largest (programmatic) player, though it has its limitations as a non-neutral party. The clear number two player is TTD."


Trade Desk stock had gained 165% from a year ago as of Monday's market close.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Trade Desk stock is below recent highs as shares consolidate. Also, its new [third-stage, flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) is relatively short.


Trade Desk's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is 99 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). The Composite Rating, part of the IBD investment system, looks at key technical and fundamental factors.


With Trade Desk's big run, expectations run high. Trade Desk stock fell 15% on May 9 after it reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped analyst estimates, but the "magnitude of the beat and raise" disappointed, said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali.


Three Analysts Downgrade Trade Desk Stock
-----------------------------------------


The company's 2019 guidance for adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — fell short of views amid higher investments by the company.


Trade Desk's adjusted profit is expected to rise only 7% to $2.89 a share in 2019. Analysts expect next year to be better. Trade Desk profit is seen rising 26% to $3.63 a share.


Wells Fargo, Nomura Instinet and RBC Capital Markets downgraded Trade Desk stock in June and early July. The analysts cited Trade Desk stock valuation and other issues.


Pivotal Research's Levine, though, is bullish on the internet TV market. Competition in direct-to-consumer video streaming services is heating up. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) are launching new web streaming services, taking on **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and others.


Trade Desk's current internet TV customers include Disney's Hulu website, **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and **Dish Network**'s ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)) Sling video service. Levine says it's early days for programmatic advertising.


Early Days In Programmatic Advertising
--------------------------------------


"If we are in the 3rd inning of programmatic for online, we are two outs into the top of the 1st inning for programmatic TV," he wrote. "We see this in early stages of inflection, and believe TTD is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunity."


Jefferies analyst Brent Thill disagrees. He downgraded Trade Desk stock to hold on Thursday.


"Growth in Connected TV and international expansion are the next legs of growth, but these initiatives may not drive numbers high enough to justify higher valuation," Thill wrote.


Trade Desk now gets about 15% of its revenue outside the U.S. In March, it launched a new ad-buying service in China.


The company has forged partnerships with Chinese internet firms **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Alibaba Group Holdings** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) to gain access to advertising inventory.

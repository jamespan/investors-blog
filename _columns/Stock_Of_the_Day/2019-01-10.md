**Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the education technology company taps new lines of growth, boasts solid growth prospects and draws the attention of big fund managers. Chegg stock touched a buy point Thursday.




The California-based company started off as an online textbook rental company, and Chegg says its customers can save up to 90% off list prices by renting textbooks. 


But lately, it has pushed into online tutoring and internship matching for both secondary-school and college students.


Chegg is the No. 1 stock in the Consumer Services-Education group, which is ranked No. 129 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

Chegg Stock Technical Analysis
------------------------------


Chegg stock closed up 0.15% at 32.52 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), after topping a 32.92 buy point intraday. Shares began in consolidating in a late-stage pattern last September. They have more than doubled in the past year, holding up unusually well during the recent stock market correction.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, had been hitting new highs before Chegg stock made a new high Thursday. That's an especially bullish sign.


Investors should bear in mind that Chegg stock has already made a big move up, which could limit future gains.


More Chegg Earnings Ahead
-------------------------


Chegg stock boasts an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 98 out of a best-possible 99. It scores a mediocre [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 72.


The company has been profitable for the last two years. Analysts on average expect EPS of 50 cents in 2018 and 63 cents in 2019. That would be up from 28 cents in 2017 and 9 cents in 2016.


Sales growth saw double-digit increases for the past four quarters, ramping up sharply from prior years, and analysts predict growth of more than 20% for the upcoming four quarters.


Indeed, accelerating growth may be ahead. Analysts expect fiscal 2018 sales to climb 22% in 2019 and 29% in 2020.


Big money managers piled into the stock as growth ramped up. Fidelity Contrafund, T. Rowe Price New Horizons and Primecap Odyssey are among top growth funds that own Chegg stock.

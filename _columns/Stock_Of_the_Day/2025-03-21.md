Dow Jones stock **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) is Friday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the property and casualty insurance play trades just below a traditional buy point despite the current market uncertainty.


Investors have been moving away from growth stocks in recent weeks and looking to put money into more defensive plays, including Travelers and other insurance industry stocks. Property and casualty providers can show more stable earnings but have their own risks, including natural disasters.




Travelers offers property and casualty coverage for individuals and businesses including home, vehicle, travel, flood and events. It has more than 15,000 independent agents and brokers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland.


Travelers topped [fourth-quarter earnings and sales](https://www.barrons.com/articles/travelers-earnings-stock-price-83cbda24?mod=md_stockoverview_news) estimates on Jan. 22. Profit grew 31% to $9.15 a share from $7.01 a share a year ago. Sales has been fairly consistent and climbed an average 12% over the last eight quarters.


Recently updated [full-year 2025 profit estimates](https://www.investors.com/research/travelers-stock-trv-insurance/) call for an 18% drop in Travelers earnings, with a big first-quarter hit as many insurers face heavy claims from the Los Angeles wildfires. But they're seen rebounding 35% in 2026. Revenue growth is expected to slow to an average 7% over the next four quarters. The insurance provider plans to report first-quarter results on April 16.

Electric-car maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as Tesla stock hit a buy point Tuesday amid ramping production of the company's Model 3 car.




Tesla stock rose 0.3% to 359.70 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Earlier in the session, it cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of 366.85 out of a 16-week [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). Tesla stock climbed as high as 368.68 before retreating as the broader markets turned south.


On a weekly chart, Tesla's relative strength line climbed to its highest level of the year. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Tesla stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 92 out of a best-possible 99.


On a cautionary note, the attempted breakout by Tesla stock was marred by low-volume trading. Investors should look for conviction in breakouts, supported by above-average trading volumes. That's an indication that institutional buyers are driving the stock higher.

News reports that Tesla had produced 1,000 Tesla Model 3 cars in a day have buoyed the stock. At that rate, the company can churn out 7,000 Model 3 units per week. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said consistent weekly production of 5,000-6,000 Tesla Model 3 cars is key to becoming profitable.


Consumer Demand Strong For Tesla Cars
-------------------------------------


"The demand for Tesla vehicles is a complete nonissue," Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said in a report Tuesday. "Tesla has not even scratched the surface yet."


He compared the Tesla Model 3 to the first **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone in 2007.


In [a report Friday](https://loupventures.com/tesla-depreciation-case-study-positive-read-on-demand/), Loup Ventures said its study of depreciation in the used-car market provides "a positive read on demand" for Tesla cars. Vehicles that are more in demand depreciate less.


Loup Ventures said a Tesla Model S holds 7% more value than its competitors regardless of variables like model year, miles driven and initial sale price.


Could Apple Buy Tesla?
----------------------


In its annual "outrageous predictions," Saxo Bank on Tuesday predicted that consumer electronics giant Apple will buy Tesla in 2019.


"What will Apple do next with its $237 billion cash-and-equivalents hoard and its important iPhone product line that is incapable of further volume growth?" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote [in a blog post](https://www.home.saxo/insights/content-hub/articles/2018/12/04/op-2019-apple-secures-funding-for-tesla-at-520share). "It's either the boring financial engineering of dividends or share buybacks or it's a bold move beyond the confines of smartphones, laptops and their associated services and accessories."


Garnry predicted that Apple will offer $520 a share for Tesla. The acquisition will help Apple broaden its product ecosystem and give Tesla the capital it needs to realize its potential, he said.


Saxo Bank is the latest in a long line of analysts and pundits who have predicted in recent years that Apple will buy Tesla.

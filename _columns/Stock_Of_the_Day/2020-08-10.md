Nike stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the athletic gear giant is breaking out after a key retail partner issued strong guidance.




The Dow Jones stock got a big boost after **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) reported robust sames-store sale figures and guided for earnings way above analyst expectations. The shoe retailer purchases around 70% of its merchandise from **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)).


Foot Locker said comparable store sales jumped by around 18% in the second quarter ended Aug. 1 and forecast EPS of 66-70 cents per share. This is higher than consensus views for 52 cents.


Nike Stock Analysis
-------------------


Shares closed up 3.5% to 105.41 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), bouncing further above their 50-day average. This also allowed Nike stock to break out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 104.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), [MarketSmith analysis shows.](https://marketsmith.investors.com/)


The Dow Jones stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been moving upward the last couple of weeks, which is encouraging. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. While the RS line for Nike stock had trended lower for much of the coronavirus market rally, that's not as much of a negative given the recent sector rotation into non-tech consumer goods stocks.


The stock is up 77% from its coronavirus crash low of 60.


Foot Locker rallied 7.8%, breaking through resistance at the 50-day line. Among Nike rivals, **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)) rose 2.8%, **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) gained 3.7% and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) added 0.6%.


Nike stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 68 out of 99. The Stock Checkup Tool shows earnings have declined by an average 44% over the past three quarters. In contrast, [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) look for 25% growth in this metric.

New Strategy Lifts Nike Stock
-----------------------------


In June, Nike [posted an unexpected loss for the fiscal fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-earnings-q4-2020-nike-stock-buy-point/). But management was upbeat on e-commerce sales trends and digital engagement with customers.

Chief Executive John Donahoe told analysts that the coronavirus pandemicÂ has accelerated the pace of digital adoption, even as physical stores reopen. He noted that Nike Training Club weekly active users were up triple digits in the quarter, including 25 million workouts with women alone.


Directly engaging with consumers through activity apps is the core of Nike's strategy as it leads to increased purchasing through consumer apps.


Nike wouldn't provide specific fiscal 2021 guidance. However, management said full-year revenue will be flat to up vs. 2020, though the first half will be down. They expect the market to remain promotional in the first half of fiscal 2021 (back half of calendar 2020) as excess inventory is drawn down.


Analysts expect Nike earnings to swell by 26% in fiscal 2021, before rising by a further 42% in fiscal 2022.



Foot Locker's Digital Momentum
------------------------------


CEO Richard Johnson said his company had managed to deliver "strong results" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This saw Foot Locker post positive EPS despite a highly promotional environment and a channel mix shift as more people shop online.


"As we continued to reopen stores throughout the quarter, we saw a strong customer response to our assortments, which we believe was aided by pent-up demand and the effect of fiscal stimulus," Johnson said in a news release. "This fueled our in-store sales and also drove continued momentum across our digital channels."


Foot Locker withdrew its full-year calendar 2020 guidance in March. The firm said Monday it was deciding against providing new full-year 2020 guidance due to the potential impact of Covid-19 on the back-to-school season, team sports participation, and additional government stimulus packages. Analysts expect full year earnings to decline by 86%.


The firm is scheduled to release full Q2 results on Aug. 21.

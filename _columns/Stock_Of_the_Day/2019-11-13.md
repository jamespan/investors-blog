IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Datadog**'s ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) first earnings report as a public company delivered a top-line beat while the bottom line was much better than expected. Datadog stock jumped Wednesday on the report.




Datadog reported September-quarter earnings late Tuesday. The company broke even, with operating income reported at $600,000, topping analyst estimates for a 14-cent loss. Revenue rose 88% to $95.9 million, blowing past estimates of $84.7 million. It's unclear whether Datadog can reach profitability on a consistent basis.


Datadog stock jumped 16.8% to close at 40.19 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). With today's pop, Datadog stock could be viewed as actionable, but is somewhat extended after forming its first base since its September IPO.


What kind of base, however, is up for debate. On one account, it shows signs of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) with a buy point of 41.54. But it also resembles a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) with a buy point of 38.07. Investors should tread cautiously, especially with recent IPOs, which can be volatile.

"We continue to see Datadog as a pioneer in its category and well positioned to take share in a largely greenfield market, but remain cognizant of an increasingly competitive environment and a premium valuation which, in our view, already reflects years of continued strong execution and share gains," Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick said in a report to clients Wednesday.


Datadog Stock: Shift To Larger Customers
----------------------------------------


Some high-profile software IPOs, such as **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and **Slack Technologies** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)), have run into turbulence. *[Check this IBD feature for IPO Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).*


The Datadog IPO priced 24 million shares at 27. Shares popped to 40.31 on the first day of trading, then pulled back. Datadog stock hit an intraday low of 27.55 on Oct. 23.


Founded in 2010, Datadog operates a monitoring and analytics platform for software developers and information technology departments. Developers and IT operations teams use its cloud-based tools to monitor software applications and computer infrastructure. Customers access its cloud platform via the internet.


Datadog initially focused on selling to smaller technology companies in 2011. More recently it has targeted large enterprises.


Datadog's customers include Airbnb, **Walt Disney**'s ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) 21st Century Fox unit, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Amazon.com**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Whole Foods. With Datadog's tools, they aim to bring new applications to market faster and monitor app performance and track key business metrics.


Some customers use Datadog tools to track applications running at cloud service providers, such as the Amazon Web Services of Amazon, or **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Azure.


DevOps Market Competition Intensifies
-------------------------------------


Datadog competes with **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), which acquired AppDynamics as well as many startups. The market is generally known as DevOps.


The name comes from streamlining software development — the act of writing and testing computer code — with tech operations. DevOps projects are one type of [digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/) that is boosting software stocks.


While competition in the DevOps market has intensified, analysts say Datadog has a strong brand.


"Datadog is the newest vendor in the monitoring space, carrying an unprecedented level of momentum in infrastructure monitoring," Cowen analyst Derrick Wood said in his note to clients. "Its core infrastructure tools focus on monitoring servers, databases and networks in cloud environments."


Datadog entered the application performance monitoring market in early 2017. It pushed into the log processing and analytics market in late 2017 through the acquisition of Logmatic.io.


Datadog Stock: Company Gaining Market Share
-------------------------------------------


Raymond James analyst Michael Turits recently initiated coverage on Datadog with a market perform rating based on valuation.


"We expect a next-gen buying cycle driven by the need to monitor cloud workloads and new (tech) architectures," said Turits. "While monitoring is a competitive space, Datadog is gaining share, with particular expertise in cloud workloads and new (tech) architectures."


Datadog had 9,500 customers as of Sept. 30, up from 7,100 a year earlier.


Datadog said it expects a December quarter loss of 1 cent to 2 cents per share vs. analyst estimates of a 5-cent loss. In fiscal 2020, analysts project a 15-cent per share loss vs. 30 cents in 2019.

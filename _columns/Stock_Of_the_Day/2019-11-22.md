**Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of body cameras and Taser stun guns nears a buy point. But analysts see another X Factor for Axon stock.




The company previously known as Taser renamed itself Axon as a string of fatalities involving police boosted demand for body cameras.


Axon also has a new body camera for law enforcement with wireless connectivity to let police departments monitor incidents in real time. And a new Taser 7 model helped earnings revenue surge past third-quarter estimates on Nov. 7.


But what really has Wall Street excited is its cloud opportunity: managing law enforcement's digital video and records.

Axon Earnings
-------------


In Q3, Axon earnings jumped 40% to 28 cents a share, while revenue grew 25% to $130.8 million. Both topped estimates, and Axon stock soared 24.6% the following day and has continued to show momentum.


Yet those aren't the underlying trends. Third-quarter strength reflected new product demand, but it followed a few quarters of declining EPS and slower sales growth as customers waited for upgrades.


Taser sales accounted for $71.4 million in Q3 sales, about 55% of the total. Sensors, or body cameras, and related software brought in $25.1 million. Meanwhile, Axon cloud sales reached $34 million, up 42% from a year ago.


Axon now has dominant positions supplying Tasers and body cameras to law enforcement. But the broad adoption of bodycams this decade created the problem of managing digital records while meeting privacy requirements. That means deleting footage and blurring out faces and license plates when a video must be shared. Axon leapt into the void and has continued to innovate.


Now Axon sees a chance to leverage its position to seamlessly manage a broad spectrum of law enforcement records. Needham analyst Scott Berg told IBD that records management is the real "wild card" for Axon stock. He figures it represents a potential $4 billion market, roughly doubling Axon's total market opportunity. The Fresno Police Department became the first to deploy Axon Records in early September.



Axon Stock Analysis
-------------------


Shares closed up 0.3% at 72.09 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), putting it 3.9% below a buy point at 75.03, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). Axon stock also retook its 50- and 200-day lines after the Q3 earnings report and continued climbing above those key support levels.


The stock chart seems to reflect anticipation of a big product development cycle for Axon. Early enthusiasm ran into a few obstacles with the ramp of the Taser 7 and LTE connectivity certification for the Axon 3 bodycam.


Axon stock has a 93 IBD Composite rating out of a possible 99. The single rating reflects earnings, sales, margin, and stock performance trends.


Axon stock has a 91 Relative Strength Rating, better than 91% of all stocks. Axon's RS Line is nearing its peak in June, meaning the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 since then.

Latin America-focused e-commerce company MercadoLibre is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Wednesday. Coming off a strong second-quarter earnings performance, shares are pushing above a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) buy point.




MercadoLibre is often called the **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) of Latin America. But it also is a [leading fintech company for the region](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/meli-stock-mercadolibre-growth-powered-by-ecommerce-fintech/), offering a popular Venmo-like digital wallet, among other services. The firm celebrated 25 years in business Friday. The company operates in 18 countries. Its shares debuted on the Nasdaq in 2007, priced at 18. MercadoLibre stock now has a market cap just under $95 billion.


MercadoLibre [stock soared 10% on Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mercadolibre-stock-soars-earnings-breakout/), Aug. 2, after the company reported stronger-than-expected third quarter results. The gains placed MercadoLibre as Latin America's [most valuable company](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercadolibre-tops-estimates-profit-doubling-200819916.html) by market cap, surpassing oil giant Petrobras. Founder Marcos Galperin celebrated the milestone in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Friday. "It had to be done ... and we did it," Galperin wrote.


MercadoLibre Q2 Earnings Cruise Past Views
------------------------------------------


MercadoLibre earned $10.48 per share on revenue of $5.1 billion for the June quarter, according to results published late Thursday, Aug. 1. Analysts expected EPS of $8.53 on revenue of $4.7 billion, according to FactSet. The company reported net income of $531 million, up sharply from $262 million in the year-earlier quarter.


The results highlighted the company's dual fast-growing businesses. Its e-commerce focused MercadoLibre platform handled gross merchandise value of $12.6 billion for the quarter, up 20% year over year. Meanwhile, the firm's Mercado Pago financial services arm processed $46.3 billion in payments, up 36% year over year.


"MercadoLibre reported strong Q2 numbers across the board," New Street Research analyst Soomit Datta wrote to clients following the report.


Datta noted that gross merchandise value in Brazil accelerated to 36% growth in local currency, from 30% year-over-year growth in Q1.


"Expectations had been for a slowdown (normalization), implying still very strong share gains in this key business," Datta wrote.


MercadoLibre also saw strong growth in Mexico, with gross merchandise value up 30%.


An [ongoing battle](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-inflation-economy-dollar-peso-black-market-libertarian-milei-d288baeae4410265bdef5e244b2c8e56) with extreme inflation in Argentina is weighing on MercadoLibre's performance in the country where it was founded. But the company noted that the second quarter marked a return to year-over-year growth for total items sold in Argentina.

LSCC Stock Ranks No. 4 In Industry Group
----------------------------------------


Lattice is a leader in low-power programmable logic chips. It serves customers in the communications, computing, industrial, automotive and consumer device markets.


Lattice Semiconductor ranks No. 4 out of 32 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-lattice-semiconductor-lscc.aspx). The fabless chip group currently ranks seventh out of 197 industry groups. Chip stocks tend to rise ahead of a semiconductor industry recovery, which is [forecast for later this year](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-companies-semiconductor-industry/).


The company holds best-possible ratings of 99 in both relative strength and earnings per share, or EPS. Further, its group's relative strength grade comes in at A+.


LSCC stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 97% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Fabless chip stocks with slightly higher ratings include **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)).


Lattice Focused On Improving Profitability
------------------------------------------


Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson on Monday reiterated his buy rating on Lattice with a price target of 20. He met with Lattice management at his firm's investor conference last week.


"Yet again, we came away from our visit with Lattice impressed with the quality of the management team and the confidence they have in enhancing the company's profitability," Anderson said in a report to clients.


"Specifically, management highlighted the fact that they are still in the 'early phase' of their price-optimization efforts despite the fact that gross margin percentage has already moved up from 56.7% in Q4 2018 to 59.0% in Q2 2019," he said.


One growth driver for the company is the addition of security content on servers, Anderson said.


"Management highlighted the fact that this demand is being driven by (original equipment manufacturers') desire to comply with the recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for securing firmware from attacks," Anderson said.

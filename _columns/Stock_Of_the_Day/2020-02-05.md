Off-price retailer **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Burlington Stores stock is back in a buy zone, after staging a bullish rebound.




Meanwhile, rivals **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) have also regained key support and buy points, after weeks of range-bound trading. Also, discount giant **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) edged back into a buy zone.


Burlington Stores Stock
-----------------------


Shares rose 1.8% to 231.64 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), still within range after reclaiming their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and 10-week line on Tuesday. Burlington Stores stock dipped below those key levels last month. Shares hit a record 236.02 in early January after clearing a [four-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) with a 230.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But Burlington Stores stock trended lower for the rest of the month. Burlington Stores stock is now right at that entry again, an additional point in its favor.


BURL stock also could be forming a new consolidation, but would need a couple more weeks for a proper base to form.


Prior to forming that four-weeks-tight pattern, [Burlington Stores stock broke out](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/burlington-stores-earnings-dollar-general-earnings-q3-2019/) from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) on Nov. 26, jumping 8.5% after the retailer reported third-quarter earnings.



At that time, Burlington earnings per share and same-store sales beat expectations. Ladies' apparel sales improved, and same-store sales were strong in home goods, kids and accessories, William Blair analysts said then.


But Burlington's profit outlook for the holiday quarter came up short of expectations. However, the William Blair analysts appeared to be encouraged by remarks from Michael O'Sullivan, Burlington's new CEO.


They said O'Sullivan's remarks indicated more conservative financial forecasting but a strategy that would bring in "fresher product in the stores, and should lead to higher (same-store sales) over time and potentially more operating margin expansion over time."


The retail chain, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, has tried to shed its reputation as just a place to buy coats. The other product lines that it has brought in over the past several years have helped.


Burlington Stores stock has a strong 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measures a company's ability to grow profit, is also a stellar 98. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), a reflection of whether a stock is beating or trailing the S&P 500, has pulled back slightly since early January. But that follows a solid uptrend for most of 2019.


TJX Stock, Ross Stores Stock
----------------------------


TJX stock dipped below its 50-day line late last month after clearing a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). But TJX stock rebounded above its 50-day line on Tuesday. On Wednesday, shares climbed 1.5% to 62.22, back above the still-valid 61.69 entry.


TJX stock's Composite Rating is 91. Its EPS Rating is 87.


Ross Stores pushed above a 117.68 buy point from a base-on-base pattern buy point in early January. Shares rose to 122.62, but then reversed to as low as 111.48 on Jan. 31. But Ross Stores stock, like Burlington Stores stock and TJX stock, has rebounded this week. Shares retook their 50-day line on Tuesday, a buying opportunity in itself. Ross Stores stock rose just over 2% to 118.74 on Wednesday, back above the 117.68 entry.


The RS lines for TJX stock and Ross Stores stock both peaked in October, earlier than Burlington Stores stock.



Costco Stock
------------


Costco stock nudged up 0.9% to 307.75 on Wednesday, back above a 307.20 flat-base entry. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock cleared that entry on Jan. 21, but soon pulled back, closing Monday near its 50-day line.

**Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) is the [IBD Stock Of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it closes in on a buy zone from a bullish base-on-base pattern.







The electronic measuring and Internet of Things company services 78 of the Fortune 100 companies and 24 of the top 25 tech titans. Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular and field instruments.


Its roots go back to Hewlett-Packard founders Bill Hewett and Dave Packard and their early measurement devices. Keysight went public after being spun off by **Agilent Technologies** ([A](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=A)), which itself was divested from HP in 1999.


Recent earnings and revenue have shown accelerating growth, and the stock's relative strength line is near a new high.


Shares in Keysight closed up 0.8% at 59.63 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The stock is currently shooting for a buy point of 62.51 from an 8-week flat base. This comes hot on the heels of a breakout from a previous flat base, making it a potentially lucrative [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/base-on-base-breakout-yield-big-gains/).

This powerful pattern usually occurs among the strongest stocks during a market correction. A base-on-base breakout can be very profitable indeed.


It occurs when a stock that is poised to break out to new highs meets resistance. A sideways-trending market makes it tough for stocks to rally after breaking out.


There are other positive technical signs for the stock. It is moving upward after finding support at its 50-day line, which is a bullish signal. In addition the stock has been making great strides in 2018, and is up 43.9% so far this year.



Stock Of The Day Has Strong Fundamentals
----------------------------------------


However it is important that a stock has solid fundamentals if it is to qualify as a CAN SLIM stock. This is the case with Keysight, which is demonstrated by its good, but not ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 80. This puts it in the top 19% of stocks tracked.


More impressive is its [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/smr-rating) of A. This important score rates companies on Sales Growth, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity ratios.


Another green light is its impressive [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 88. The company currently sits in fourth place in the Electronics-Scientific/Measuring group.

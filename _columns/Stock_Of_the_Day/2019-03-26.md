'Massive Opportunity' For Futu Holdings Stock
---------------------------------------------


Futu Holdings in recent years got most of its revenue through a company in Hong Kong that it oversees called Futu International Hong Kong. It also gets a fraction of sales from research and development activities in China.


The company says it "is pursuing a massive opportunity to facilitate a once-in-a-generation shift in the wealth management industry and build a digital gateway into broader financial services by primarily serving the emerging affluent Chinese population."


The company offers its investing services through a platform called Futu NiuNiu, which works on mobile and other electronic devices. Futu's fee-based services include trade execution and margin financing, according to the company's website.


Its website also says that Futu's investing services incorporate social media capabilities to connect users, investors, analysts, businesses, news outlets and "key opinion leaders."


Regulatory Issues, Ongoing Investigations
-----------------------------------------


The company has 5.6 million users, according to a prospectus filed this month. Still, the company warns that it is vulnerable to "significant competition in the online brokerage industry" and "extensive and evolving regulatory requirements in Hong Kong." Same goes for China.


The company's sales and profits hinge on trading volume, leaving it exposed to any slowdown in the markets resulting from a broader global economic slowdown. Ongoing trade friction between the U.S. and China is also a possible threat.


What's more, Futu International Hong Kong is "involved in certain ongoing inquiries and investigations" related to anti-money-laundering laws, client onboarding and trading activity. Futu also said it recently identified a "material weakness" in its internal financial controls, partially related to insufficient staff well-versed in U.S. financial reporting rules. The company said it had begun to address the issue.

**Celsius Holdings** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the top beverage producer makes its first test of the 10-week moving average following a huge run.




The Boca Raton, Florida-based fitness drink producer was founded in 2004 and is a top stock in the current market. Celsius Holdings stock is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) watchlist. The company is a global consumer packaged goods business that sells its fitness energy beverage under the brand name Celsius. Its main competitors are **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), which has an alliance with **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), and Rauch's Red Bull.


Growth is booming. Celsius earnings spiked to 12 cents per share in the second quarter vs. 1-cent a year earlier. Revenue increased 137% to $154 million. Analysts forecast third-quarter EPS gaining 233% to 10 cents, according to FactSet. Wall Street expects sales to jump 70% t0 $162 million.


On Aug. 1, the company announced a distribution deal with **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)). Under the arrangement, Pepsi will distribute Celsius globally, greatly widening the product's reach. As part of the deal, PepsiCo is investing $550 million, giving the drinking and snacks giant an estimated 8.5% CELH stock stake.


Celsius Holdings Stock
----------------------


Shares dropped 3.9% to 98.23 during Wednesday's [market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/gains-fade-as-stock-market-tries-to-extend-uptrend-this-beer-stock-tops-buy-point/). Celsius triggered the [7%-8% loss sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) on a late August move from a short consolidation.


Still, from the May 10 low to the Aug. 26 peak of 118.19, Celsius stock skyrocketed 209%.


CELH stock has been finding support at its 10-week line for the past few weeks. The first or second 50-day/10-week test following a breakout can offering a buying opportunity.


Investors could use a strong bounce from the 10-week line as an aggressive entry. One option would be to buy CELH stock as it clears the Sept. 15 short-term high of 108.37. Right now, that would push Celsius a fair amount above the 10-week line.



The current market correction only adds to the risks. CELH stock has held up remarkably well, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) right at highs, but if the market continues to skid lower, the odds would rise that Celsius would start to buckle.


Ideally, Celsius stock would consolidate for a few more weeks, forging a proper base as well as letting the 50-day/10-week line move higher.


Celsius Holdings stock has strong fundamentals and ranks first in the [Beverages-Non-Alcoholic industry group](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-celsius-holdings-inc-celh.aspx), ahead of companies including Coca Cola and **Keurig Dr Pepper** ([KDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KDP)).


CELH shares have a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) of 99. It has a 98 Relative Strength Rating, an exclusive [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-celsius-holdings-inc-celh.aspx) gauge for share-price movement with a 1 to 99 score. The rating shows how a stock's performance over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in IBD's database. The stock has an EPS Rating of 78.


Meanwhile, PEP stock dropped 0.3%, above its 200-day line but just shy of its 50-day. MNST stock dropped 0.8%, nudging above its 200-day. Coca-Cola fell 0.8% and KDP stock 0.7%.

**Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The oil and gas exploration and production company is nearing a buy point.




Marathon Oil stock climbed 0.8% to 20.86 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The stock is nearing a buy point of 22.22 from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) as part of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). Base-on-base patterns can be extremely powerful in a struggling market.


Marathon Oil Stock Held Strong
------------------------------


Marathon Oil stock is the IBD Stock of the Day, but in many ways it's been the energy stock of the year. Unlike many of its peers, Marathon didn't fall much when crude prices retreated from late May to mid-June. Now it's in prime position for a new breakout with crude prices rising.


Marathon Oil stock found support from its fast-rising [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/), another sign of strength before hitting a buy point. Marathon's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is nearing a new high.



Marathon Oil engages in fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota. But the company isn't just U.S. focused. It also has operations in Europe and Africa.


Marathon Oil Stock Fundamentals Improve
---------------------------------------


With crude prices rebounding since late 2016, Marathon Oil has been profitable for the past two quarters, with revenue surging 62% in the latest period. Marathon Oil is expected to earn 80 cents a share in 2018, ending a three-year string of annual losses.


Other Energy Stocks Advance With Crude
--------------------------------------


**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) jumped 1%, while **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was up 0.55%. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both Dow Jones stocks. But Marathon Oil leads the Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group.


**EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, rose 0.8% to 124.48 and is poised to make its own breakout from a flat base. EOG stock's buy point is 128.13.


Energy stocks are rising with oil prices. Crude futures have rallied since [OPEC and Russia](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-meeting-oil-production-increase-saudi-russia-iran-divide/) agreed on vague, modest production increases that allayed concerns of a big output increase. Oil prices have kept rising on supply concerns out of Canada and the looming loss of Iranian exports as the Trump administration reimposes sanctions. On Friday U.S. crude rallied to its highest level since November 2014.


But if oil prices retreat, energy stocks will struggle to hold recent levels, let alone advance.

**HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Indian banking giant closes in on a buy point despite ongoing market turbulence. NYSE-listed HDFC stock has shown remarkable strength in recent months. HDFC Bank earnings growth has slowed in recent quarters, but analysts predict stronger growth over the next several quarters.




HDFC Bank is in a strong position after taking a conservative stance on corporate lending. It limited its exposure as other Indian banks, especially the state-controlled giants, aggressively pushed into corporate lending amid the financial crisis. Its rivals have been left badly bruised, as many borrowers have been unable to service their loans. According to data from S&P Global, state-owned banks hold around 70% of total loans, and also hold 85% of the bad debt.


During that period HDFC Bank has posted steady growth, and now holds India's largest consumer loan book. It's now the second-largest private sector Indian bank. JPMorgan expects private-sector banks will be able to grab market share as state-owned banks try to get to grips with ongoing challenges.


HDFC Bank Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------


HDFC Bank stock  advanced 0.4% to 103.59 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). It's closing in on a 104.60 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). IBD research shows the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) is a classic bullish pattern.



After peaking on July 12, HDFC Bank stock fell for nearly three months to bottom at 85.43 on Oct. 11. But since then shares have rebounded, while the major U.S. stock market indexes fell into stock market corrections or even bear markets. As a result, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has surged to record highs.

HDFC Bank stock is  trading above both its 50 and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/). The [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) undercut the 200-day at the end of September, a bearish signal. But the 50-day line is closing that gap.


HDFC Bank stock is acting well, so it's worth considering for watch lists. But investors shouldn't be buying during a stock market correction. A stock market rally is underway, but there has been no [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) yet.


Stock Of The Day Has Solid Fundamentals
---------------------------------------


HDFC stock boasts a 95 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their run.


HDFC earnings and sales growth have decelerated for the last three quarters, with just 5% EPS growth in the latest quarter. But for the next four quarters analysts expect HDFC earnings growth of 18%, 11%, 35% and 38%.


India's large economy is expected to keep growing at a strong clip in 2019, providing a tailwind for HDFC earnings and HDFC stock.

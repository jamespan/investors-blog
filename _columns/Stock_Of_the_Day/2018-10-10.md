**Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the telecom services provider breaks out of a flat base and nears a buy point. Institutional investors may shift to Verizon stock and other defensive plays amid a broad market sell-off that has pummeled technology companies.




Stocks have been pressured by the Federal Reserve's plans to pull interest rates gradually higher. Ten-year bond yields are expected to reach 4% to 5% next year. Rising interest rates would normally be a negative for a [high dividend paying stock](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/) like Verizon.


Institutional investors, though, may be shifting to defensive stocks such as telecom. [Utility stocks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/bears-stock-market/) also gained on Wednesday.


"Rising interest rates not only mean more competition for yield, which hurts dividend stocks like Verizon, they also mean a higher cost-of-capital, which punishes longer term growth stories much more than shorter term, free-cash-flow stories," said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson in an email.

Cost Of Capital Behind Market Rotation?
---------------------------------------


"After years of out-performance for growth stocks, the market is incredibly wrongly positioned for the shift to higher WACCs (weighted average cost of capital)," Moffett went on to say. "I suspect we are seeing a rush to the other side of the boat, to reposition away from WACC-sensitive growth names and into what used to be thought of as defensive names like Verizon."


Verizon stock fell 1.2% to close at 54.33 as a market sell-off intensified on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/bears-stock-market/). But the stock's relative strength moved up to an IBD rating of 81. Verizon has a technical buy point of 55.31. In earlier trading on Wednesday, Verizon touched 55.90.


Verizon stock formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern starting Feb. 1. The Dow component stock hit a low of 46.38 on May 9 before rebounding. Verizon stock consolidated in August and September as investors watched for signs that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates.


Verizon Stock: Wireless Outlook Improving
-----------------------------------------


Higher rates would usually be an overhang on telecom stocks. But there's an improved outlook for Verizon's core business — wireless services.


A wireless price war has eased up since mid-2017. The big four national wireless firms — Verizon, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) and **Sprint** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) — have not launched aggressive promotions following the launch of new **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhones as they sometimes do.


Verizon expects wireless service revenue growth to continue rebounding in the back half of 2018. The company reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 23.


"The wireless market remains competitive, but relatively rational," said Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, in a report. "We believe Verizon held its own on smartphone adds in the September quarter and momentum has continued from Q2 into Q3."


T-Mobile, Sprint Merger Could Ease Price War
--------------------------------------------


Verizon added 199,000 high-spending, postpaid phone subscribers in the June quarter. That topped estimates of 126,000.


T-Mobile and Sprint, meanwhile, are seeking regulatory approval to merge. If regulators give that merger a green light, Verizon could benefit in two ways, analysts say. The deal would eliminate one price discounter. And T-Mobile and Sprint would face challenges integrating their businesses.


Verizon has outperformed telecom peer AT&T, also a high dividend paying stock, in 2018.


AT&T fell 1.9% to 32.86 on Wednesday. AT&T stock has dropped 14% this year. Verizon stock has gained nearly 4%.


Verizon 5G Wireless Plans
-------------------------


AT&T added a ton of debt to acquire media giant Time Warner in July. Verizon has told analysts it is not interested in making a big acquisition, such as satellite broadcaster **Dish Network** ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)) or media firm **CBS** ([CBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBS)).


Hans Vestberg, former chief executive of network gear maker Ericsson, took over as Verizon's CEO Aug. 1. The company says Vestberg has the technical know-how and experience to build out a next-generation 5G wireless network.


Verizon has been testing high-speed 5G video services to residential homes and apartment buildings. Verizon is mulling whether to challenge cable TV firms such as **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)), which dominate in providing high-speed internet services to consumers. Barclays downgraded Verizon in September on worries that its capital spending could jump next year.

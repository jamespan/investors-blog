**Winnebago** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as demand for recreational vehicles looks to persist even as the pandemic fades. WGO stock flashed an early buy signal after clearing resistance at a key technical level.




Iowa-based Winnebago benefited from a pandemic surge in RV sales. Americans averse to flying with others in confined spaces packed into RVs and motor homes. They craved the outdoors but wished to travel the country in a safe way.


But even as travel restrictions ease, Covid-19 cases fall, and vaccinations rise, RVs have not lost their momentum. Indeed, the RV Industry Association reported Monday that wholesale RV shipments in North America set a fresh record of 148,507 units in Q1, about 10% higher than the prior record from 2018. But even before the pandemic, RV sales had seen a roughly decade-long boom.


In December, Winnebago CEO Michael Happe told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/winnebago-ceo-pent-up-demand-will-sustain-covid-boom-in-rv-sales.html) that he expects the pandemic-fueled demand for RVs to last into 2021.


He added that his customers are getting younger and more diverse. And they're using the products in many different ways — not just for recreation.


"The work-from-anywhere trend is quite strong right now, and a lot of our new consumers are seeing these products as a way to work from the road or a beautiful campground somewhere here in America."

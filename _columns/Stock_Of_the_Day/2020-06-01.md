Like most every other stock since the coronavirus pandemic emerged, Tesla plunged from near record highs in late February, dropping about 63% to a three-month low of 350.51 by mid-March. It has since rebounded by roughly 150%.


Tesla Stock Gets High Composite Rating
--------------------------------------


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-inc-tsla.aspx) shows that Tesla has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Tesla stock currently outperforms 96% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


The stock also has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks. Also, Tesla stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at record highs. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


However, Tesla stock has a weak EPS Rating of 65, which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth with all other stocks.


Holds No. 1 Ranking Among Auto Stocks
-------------------------------------


Tesla holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in IBD's Auto Manufacturers Group. It's followed by **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) then **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)). The group also holds the top rank out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.


In mid-May, Tesla was allowed by local authorities to restart production at its plant in Fremont, Calif. The plant was forced to close for about 8 weeks due to the pandemic. It continues to face near-term risks from the Covid-19 outbreak, as it could lead to softening demand as consumers pull back on spending.


As a result of the initial plant closure, when Tesla reported [first-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-in-spotlight-with-quarterly-earnings-report/) on April 29, it pulled second-quarter and full-year guidance. The stock surged the following day, then pulled back.


The electric-car company reported an adjusted profit of $1.24 per share on revenue of $5.98 billion. Wall Street expected a loss of 26 cents on revenue of $6.16 billion.


"It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels," Tesla said in written remarks with its [quarterly earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-in-spotlight-with-quarterly-earnings-report/).


In early April, Tesla reported it [delivered 88,400 vehicles](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-jumps-vehicle-deliveries-beat-estimates/) in the first quarter. That beat Wall Street estimates of about 80,000.


In addition to making its all-electric vehicles in Fremont, Tesla is also building them in China, after what was a temporary delay.


Tesla Turns The Corner
----------------------


"Tesla appears to be turning the corner from both a demand and production perspective heading into the month of June," Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.


"While second-quarter delivery numbers remain in flux due to a host of logistical issues as well as overall lockdown conditions now starting to ease across the U.S. and Europe, it appears underlying demand for Model 3 in China is strong with a solid May and June likely in the cards and clear momentum heading into the second half."


Ives has a neutral rating on Tesla stock, with a 12-month price target of 800.


Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

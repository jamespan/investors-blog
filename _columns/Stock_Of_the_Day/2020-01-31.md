**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, as the e-commerce giant on Friday soared to record highs on a blockbuster earnings announcement after a long consolidation. Amazon stock jumped despite a rough day in the stock market overall.




Shares of Amazon jumped 7.4% to close at 2,008.72 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Its market valuation flirted with the lofty $1 trillion zone. **Apple** ([APPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are the only other companies to reach that threshold.


Amazon stock was in a long phase of consolidation, trending mostly sideways for the past 16 months as investors were uncertain about big investments and market pressures the company was facing.


Investors were concerned about the potential negative impacts of ongoing infrastructure investments, competitive pressures in cloud services, an increase in spending on its one-day shipping plan and other programs. The main concern was how all this would impact profits.

The concern seemed justified. Amazon [missed profit expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-third-quarter-stock/) in the third quarter and provided revenue guidance for the fourth quarter that also fell short of Wall Street estimates.


Amazon Earnings Beat Expectations
---------------------------------


Then, when Amazon revealed its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, those fears washed away, as the e-commerce giant [blew past expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-revenue-crush-estimates-as-stock-jumps/).


The company said adjusted earnings were $6.47 a share on revenue of $87.4 billion. Wall Street expected the e-commerce giant to report earnings of $4.05 a share on revenue of $85.97 billion.


"Amazon's fourth-quarter results showcased the benefits of the company's increasingly diversified business model and one-day rollout," Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients. "Looking ahead, growth investments are likely to further widen the company's competitive moat."


Sebastian raised his price target on Amazon stock to 2,275, from 2,080.


During the consolidation phase of Amazon stock, it formed a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) that ultimately led to a failed breakout. Following that, Amazon formed a longer [saucer-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base, which began on July 11. The handle on the base started forming on Jan. 9. The breakout occurred Friday, the morning after its earnings report. In a breakaway gap like Amazon's, investors can use the opening price of 2,051.47 as a reasonable buy point.


Amazon Stock A Top Pick
-----------------------


"We reiterate Amazon as our top pick in internet, given attractive growth-adjusted valuation and further upside to estimates," wrote Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, in his report to clients. His price target on Amazon stock is 2,300, with an upside scenario of 2,800.


Among the investments that are paying off for Amazon is the hundreds of millions poured into making its one-day shipping plan available to its Amazon Prime customer-rewards program.


During the conference call with analysts after the earnings report, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky credited the one-day shipping expansion for helping Amazon exceed fourth-quarter revenue expectations.


"We had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year," Olsavsky said. "I think Prime has been very strong."


Prime Customers Spend Double
----------------------------


Historically, Amazon Prime customers spend more than double what non-Prime customers spend, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.


Amazon said it ended the quarter with 150 million paid Prime members globally. That's up from 100 million in 2018. More people joined Prime in the fourth quarter than any other previous quarter, the company said.


With Amazon Prime, customers pay an annual membership fee of $119. In return, they get free shipping, access to its online video and music services, and other perks.


Another highlight in the fourth quarter was the revenue growth of Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing unit. AWS reported revenue of $9.95 billion, up 34% and above estimates of $9.62 billion.


Amazon Web Services Fuels Upside
--------------------------------


The surprise came even as Amazon was facing increased pressure in cloud computing from Microsoft, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and Alphabet.


"Amazon's AWS strength drove the upside to consensus expectations," said Sebastian.


AÂ fundamental analysis of Amazon stock is a key component of determining whether it's worth buying.


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows that Amazon stock currently has a weak [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 64 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Amazon stock currently outperforms 64% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


It also has a weak [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 53, which measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months against that of all other stocks. These figures are expected to improve with today's stock action.

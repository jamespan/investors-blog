Burlington Stores is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the off-price retailer continues to show strength in a stock market correction. Burlington Stores stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average Wednesday, and its relative strength line is at an all-time high.




Burlington is the latest company appealing to bargain shoppers to notch the Stock of The Day honor amid the stock market correction. Off-price peers **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) are recent Stock of the Day entries. Specialty discounter **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is also closing in on a buy point.


Burlington Stores operates 629 off-price retail stores in 45 states and Puerto Rico. It offers high-quality apparel from top brands such as Levi and Armani. It even offers boots from pop star Katy Perry's label.

Also, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at an all-time high.

It's A Stock Market Correction

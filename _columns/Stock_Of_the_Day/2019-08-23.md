RingCentral stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of business communications software aims to clear a three-weeks-tight chart pattern, after popping on an earnings beat.




RingCentral stock jumped 11% on July 30 after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street targets. For the next two weeks, RingCentral stock traded in a tight range.


A proper three-weeks-tight pattern requires that a stock finishes no more than 1.5% above or below the prior week's close for two consecutive weeks, that is three weeks of tight closes. Investors can view it on a weekly chart.


The three-weeks-tight is normally used to add shares to a stock an investor already owns. New investors sometimes can make an initial purchase with this pattern. However, amid the current stock market volatility, investors should be cautious.

RingCentral's three-weeks-tight pattern creates a new [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 146.48. On a down day for stocks, its shares dipped 0.6% Friday to close at 141.50 but RingCentral was up 2.1% for the week.


Hot IPO Zoom Video A RingCentral Sales Partner
----------------------------------------------


The company sells cloud-based business communications software for workplace collaboration and customer support. The platform provides voice, chat, conferencing and application integration.


RingCentral competes with **8x8** ([EGHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGHT)), **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)) and others in what Wall Street analysts call the unified communications market.


**AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) is one of RingCentral's sales channel partners. Another one is **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), now on the [IBD Leaderboard watch list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist).


Zoom has rolled out a new phone product. Analysts disagree on whether the new Zoom Phone will compete with RingCentral's products.


"The unified communications market has a plethora of competitors, from legacy vendors such as **Avaya** ([AVYA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVYA)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) to cloud providers such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT))," said William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri in an Aug. 8 report.


RingCentral Stock: Relative Strength Bullish
--------------------------------------------


"RingCentral sees its R&D as a competitive advantage, prioritizing product investment as a way to maintain leadership in the market," he added.


RingCentral's Relative Strength Rating is 97 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). That's a bullish signal. That means it has outperformed 97% of all stocks. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.


Furthermore, RingCentral's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is holding near highs. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.


Typically, the strongest stocks' relative strength lines are either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground. The RS line is in blue in all IBD stock charts.


In July, RingCentral announced the hiring of Will Moxley as chief product officer. Previously, Moxley spent 13 years with **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) in multiple roles.

LPL Financial Earnings And Fundamental Analysis
-----------------------------------------------


The broker dealer bears a strong [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 87 out of 99.


In the fourth quarter of 2021, LPL Financial posted robust asset growth in the brokerage and advisory channels. Total advisory and brokerage assets rose 34% year over year to $1.21 trillion. Net new assets increased $26 billion in Q4 and $119 billion for the full year, thanks in large part to the Waddell & Reed buy.


"Our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire advisor-centered marketplace, which for us means being the best at empowering advisors to deliver great advice to their clients," LPL CEO Dan Arnold said on a Feb. 4 earnings call.


For all of 2021, LPL Financial earnings per share rebounded 9% after diving 10% in 2020. Revenue jumped 32% in both Q4 and all of 2021.


Analysts on Wall Street expect EPS to jump 35% in 2022 as revenue grows 18%. LPL Financial earnings are seen vaulting a further 50% in 2023 as revenue rises 16%. The San Diego, Calif.-based company reports its first-quarter results on April 28.

LPL Revenues And Fed Rate hikes
-------------------------------


Financials, including LPLA stock, generally get a boost from rising interest rates.


The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate was near zero throughout 2021. But on March 16, the Fed hiked its key interest rate for the first time since 2018 and signaled six more increases to come this year.


The rate hikes should mean higher LPL revenues.


"Our revenue is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in fees payable to us from banks participating in our client cash programs, which are generally based on prevailing interest rates," the company's 2021 Annual report says.


In the past, LPL's revenue from its client cash programs fell because of low interest rates.


LPLA Stock: Recruiting Pays Off
-------------------------------


Recruiting continues to pay off for LPL as it closes in on 20,000 advisors.


In 2021, recruited assets more than doubled to $89 billion.


"We will crest that very soon," Rich Steinmeier, an LPL executive, told [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/lpl-financial-fourth-quarter-2021-earnings-51644005407?mod=ap_hp_indyadv1). "I don't know that there's a cap. I don't. It's not 20,000. It's not going to be 30,000. There's not a cap."

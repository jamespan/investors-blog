Luxury home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as sales are still strong amid growing hope for a Covid vaccine that may loosen stay-at-home orders and social distancing. RH stock rose solidly Tuesday, closing in on buy points.




RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, sells upscale home furnishings through its retail galleries in the U.S. and Canada, source books and online. Even as the pandemic shuttered stores, RH forged ahead with lavish openings. In July it opened a 60,000-square-foot, three-level location in Marin, Calif. The store included a rooftop restaurant. In June, it opened a 50,000-square-foot, three-level store in Charlotte, N.C. That one too included a rooftop restaurant.


RH stock soared in the months following the pandemic, as affluent homeowners stuck at home during lockdowns spent heavily on sprucing up their homes. RH beat analysts' fiscal second-quarter estimates with earnings per share jumping 53% to $4.90 a share. Revenue was flat at $709.3 million, but that was a big improvement from Q1's 19% drop.


"We are benefiting from the Covid-driven shift of spending in favor of the home, but this has coincided with a systemic shift and leapfrog of our operating model to a level unseen before in our industry," CEO Gary Friedman said in a note to investors after releasing Q2 earnings.

RH Outlook
----------


But what will happen to this nesting trend now that Pfizer says it has a coronavirus vaccine that is more than 90% effective? That's hard to say. After mass vaccinations end the pandemic, upscale shoppers may flock to the company's huge brick-and-mortar stores. Or they may curb spending on furnishings in favor of travel and entertainment.


For now, industry analysts say consumers are focusing on the holidays. October unofficially rang in the holiday season as many major retailers launched massive online promotions. Online sales soared 50% year over year during Oct. 11-17, 2020, according to a Deloitte survey.


Deloitte's Holiday Retail Survey also found that spending on socializing away from home and travel is expected to decline 34% year over year, to $260 per household. It added that as of early October, consumers were still feeling anxious about travel. Only 29% of U.S. consumers felt safe taking a flight. Just 41% felt safe staying in a hotel.

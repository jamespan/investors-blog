**Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)), the coffee and doughnut chain, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Dunkin' Brands stock is testing a buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), with a key indicator flashing bullish signals. The stock chart looks tasty but Dunkin' Brands earnings are less than eye-watering.


Other restaurant stocks continue to perform well, including **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).




Dunkin' Brands Stock
--------------------


Shares of the company, which owns Dunkin' doughnut shops and Baskin-Robbins, were trying to break out from a flat base with an 83. 32 buy point. The stock began forming the base in June.


Dunkin' Brands stock rose 1.9% to 82.51 in the [stock market today,](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) after just hitting the entry point of 83.32 intraday, a record high. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is already soaring into new high ground, a very bullish signal.


The rising RS line means Dunkin' Brands stock is outperforming the S&P 500. The S&P 500 and other major indexes have been volatile amid China trade war headlines and an inverted yield curve.



Dunkin' Brands Earnings
-----------------------


Dunkin' Brands earnings for the second quarter topped expectations on Aug. 1. Overall revenue missed, but same-store sales rose 1.7%, slightly above views.


Dunkin' Brands earnings were driven by lower taxes and interest and operating income, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles noted. EPS was largely in line excluding those factors. Dunkin' also largely kept its full-year financial forecasts the same.


However, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said the results were "encouraging." He called out the Dunkin's efforts shake up its menu to bring more espresso to customers. Espresso is Dunkin's fastest growing sales segment, putting up 40% growth from the prior year.


Saleh also cited progress in the digital ordering segment and "strong loyalty sign-ups." The company is also giving its U.S. its stores a makeover, with double drive-thru lanes — one geared toward mobile orders — cold-brew taps and new espresso machines.

Still, Dunkin' Brands earnings growth — a staple of top stocks hasn't been inspiring.

Sales growth, another characteristic of strong stocks, has also muddled along in the single digits.

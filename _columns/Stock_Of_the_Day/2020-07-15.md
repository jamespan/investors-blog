**Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the medical testing company broke out to a record high Wednesday.




The company sells animals for clinical testing and provides drug development services for [biotech and pharmaceutical companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/). In the first quarter, the medical testing company said it experienced a "sharp decline" in demand for animals from academic institutions.


But that's likely to be short-lived, Jefferies analyst David Windley said in a report to clients. In 2019, that segment brought in 20% of total revenue. About a third of those sales stem from academic institutions, which were stymied by the pandemic.


Now, academic institutions in Europe and the U.S. are coming back online.

CLOSE




"That's a positive for (research models and services), where the abrupt closing of academic institutions drove the sharp demand decline in the first quarter," Windley said. "If the recovery lasts, we expect to see academics return to their labs and begin ordering animals."


Medical Testing Withstands Pandemic
-----------------------------------


Charles River owns half of the market for animal research, Windley said. In the first quarter, that segment saw a 1.7% organic decline to $146 million in sales.


"There was also a significant reduction in order activity for both large biopharmaceutical and smaller biotechnology clients, as these clients reduced or closed their on-site activities," Chief Executive James Foster said on the conference call with analysts in May.


Foster called for that trend to persist in the second quarter. But after a meeting with the medical testing outlet in June, Jefferies' Windley noted the company now says it's possible academic institutions could engage in "some incremental 'catch-up' ordering."


Meanwhile, demand for discovery and safety assessment services remains robust, he said. This segment helps [biotech](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) and [pharmaceutical companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/best-pharmaceutical-stocks-to-buy/) to develop drugs. Organically, sales grew 11.6% to $438.7 million in the first quarter.



A number of clients shifted their focus to preclinical work amid the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), Windley said. This helped Charles River, which focuses largely on preclinical testing for drug development. Preclinical testing is performed in cells and/or animals.


Lastly, the manufacturing support business was "unscathed" by the pandemic, he said. Sales were $122.4 million, increasing 9.6% organically. In part, this business unit performs sterility checks of manufacturing services.


Coronavirus Will Impact 2020: Charles River
-------------------------------------------


Even with the decline for animal sales, Charles River exited the first quarter with 31% earnings growth to $1.84 per share, minus some items. In fact, the medical testing company's adjusted profit growth has accelerated for four straight quarters.


Total revenue also ramped up 17% to $707.1 million. That metric also has accelerated for the last three quarters. On an organic basis, sales climbed 8.2%, Charles River Chief Financial Officer David Smith said in an email to Investor's Business Daily.


He noted the company was the only contract resource organization, also called a CRO, to update its 2020 outlook amid the pandemic. For the year, the medical testing company expects the virus to cut revenue by $135 million to $215 million.


"We have kept our sites operational to accommodate continued client demand and clients continue to place work with us, both for Covid-19-related programs and general drug development, because of the ease and flexibility of outsourcing projects to a CRO partner like Charles River," he said.


The health care industry is playing a crucial role amid the pandemic, Smith said. Biotechs are key partners for Charles River. In 2019, Charles River worked on 85% of the drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, he said.


"The biotech industry will continue to be an important client base and primary growth driver for Charles River, as they are the principle source of much of this innovation and beneficiaries of the continued, robust biotech funding environment," he said.


Longer-Term Potential Exists
----------------------------


The second quarter is looking a bit shakier. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share on $635 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, earnings would decline about 22% and sales would slip 3.4%.


There's strong longer-term potential for the medical testing company, William Blair analyst John Kreger said in a June report.


"We remain comfortable that Charles River can generate low-double-digit EPS growth longer term and although the stock is trading above the clinical peers, we believe there is potential upside to the multiple," he said.


That's particularly true if the medical testing outlet shifts deeper into [cell and gene therapy](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/gene-therapy-blazes-amid-fda-approvals-pharmaceutical-companies-getting-hungry/), an area where it's still underweight, he said. Kreger maintained his outperform rating.


Despite expectations for a second-quarter slowdown, analysts polled by Zacks project 2.2% earnings growth and 5.2% sales growth in 2020.

Twilio Tools Embed Communications Into Apps
-------------------------------------------


Twilio's core product had been a messaging service that worked inside apps such as Uber Technologies' ride-hailing service. Its software platform now gives app developers building blocks to embed real-time voice, text messaging and video into their products.


Twilio's software also makes it easier for cloud applications to communicate with each other. Its application programming interface, or API, works behind the scenes in consumer apps such as Uber, Airbnb and OpenTable as well as business software from Salesforce.com and **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)).


"Communications will be woven into every application, workflow, and process that we use as consumers and as businesses because it makes our communications feel seamless and magical," Twilio Chief Executive Jeff Lawson said in a 2017 interview with [PC Magazine](https://www.pcmag.com/news/351964/twilio-ceo-jeff-lawson-talks-apps-future-of-communication).


Twilio Rebounded From Uber Decline
----------------------------------


Twilio stock catapulted 278% last year.


In 2018, Twilio stock rebounded from declining sales tied to key customer Uber. The hiring of a former Salesforce executive re-energized Twilio's sales strategy, analysts say.


Analysts also are upbeat about Twilio's rollout of a new product — "Flex"-branded software for customer-service departments called contact centers.


Twilio in October agreed to buy SendGrid in a $2 billion all-stock acquisition. SendGrid provides a cloud-based email marketing platform.


"For 2019, we look forward to expansion with existing customers, the addition of new customers, the ramp of Twilio Flex and new opportunities with the pending SendGrid acquisition," White said in the report.

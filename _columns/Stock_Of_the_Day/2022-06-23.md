**UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). UNH stock retook a key level of technical support as it sets up in a base.


Shares of the U.S. health-insurance giant have held up, with managed care providers in general mounting a three-day rally, as investors try to play defense against a stock market upended by rising prices and recession risks.


UNH Stock
---------


Shares of UnitedHealth closed up 2.1% to 499.81 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). The stock has formed a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 507.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). Shares closed above their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on Thursday, their first finish above that key level of investor support since April.


The relative strength line for UNH stock is at a new high, showing strong outperformance against the S&P 500. Shares have a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) from IBD.


UnitedHealth holds an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 89, and its earnings outlook remains solid. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow 14% this year and 14% next year.


Among other health care stocks, **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) is showing similar chart action.


Like UNH stock, Centene is in a double-bottom base. The buy point on that base is 87.44. Shares ended up 2.2% to 83.64 on Thursday, and were holding support above their 50-day line.


**Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)), up 1.5%, was also fighting to hold its 50-day line. **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)), up 1.5%, was standing firm on support at its 50-day line. Humana's relative strength line was also at a new high, as indicated by the [blue dot on MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/).


UnitedHealth, in April, reported [first-quarter earnings that beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/unitedhealth-earnings-top-estimates-on-optum-expansion-unh-stock-rises/). The company also raised its full-year profit outlook.


Prices are rising for things like groceries and gasoline. But UnitedHealth, unlike manufacturers, is relatively insulated from those costs, an [IBD article in March noted](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/unh-stock-why-dow-jones-giant-was-built-for-this-moment/). Rising interest rates have pushed profits higher, benefiting UNH stock.


UnitedHealth, via its Optum division, is also hoping to gain on a shift toward paying health care providers for better health outcomes, rather than the services provided.

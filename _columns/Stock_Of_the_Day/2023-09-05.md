LBRT shares broke out from a handle base on news that the stock is set to join the S&P 600.

Oil futures rose Tuesday after Saudi Arabia decided to extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day through the end of the year, MarketWatch reported. Saudi oil production in October, November and December will remain around 9 million barrels per day.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures climbed to $87 a barrel on Tuesday, their highest level since November 2022.

For the year, FactSet analysts expect earnings to jump 40.5% to $3.09 per share on 11.11% revenue growth to $4.61 billion.

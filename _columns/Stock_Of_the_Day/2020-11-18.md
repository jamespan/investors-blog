**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the big-box retail giant blew away Q3 earnings and same-store sales forecasts on Wednesday, amid an early start to the holiday shopping season this year. Target stock jumped into buy range intraday.




The Minneapolis-based company posted EPS of $2.79 on revenue of $22.63 billion, with same-store sales up 20.7% and comparable digital sales up 155%. Customer traffic was up 4.5%, and the average ticket climbed 15.6%.


"This was a banner quarter for Target surpassing even the most optimistic estimates for comp sales and bottom line on the Street," said Third Bridge analyst Nick Shields. "Perhaps the most encouraging factor was the company's disclosure that customers are making more frequent trips into stores, suggesting brick-and-mortar customers will be willing to come into the stores this holiday season."


Holiday Shopping Boosts Target Sales
------------------------------------


Target's results come as it and other retailers kicked off holiday promotions in October, when **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) also launched its belated Prime Day. Deals are expected to continue through December, since shoppers won't be able to crowd stores on a single day like Black Friday as they have in past years.


Target has boosted its e-commerce capabilities to support the expected high volumes. Target uses Order Pick Up (BOPIS), Drive Up (curbside pickup) and Shipt, which Target uses to fulfill its digital orders.


Order Pickup surged more than 50%, Drive Up shot up more than 500%, and Shipt soared 280%.


"We expect revenue to grow by about 12% in FY 21, with the increase driven primarily by robust online sales growth," said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson in a note ahead of earnings.

Shares were also buyable after bouncing off their 10-week line. The relative strength line spiked and is nearing recent highs.

Target's Partnership With Ulta Beauty
-------------------------------------


Last week, Target said it had teamed up with **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) to set up shop-in-shop destinations at 100 Target stores nationwide in 2021.


Target plans to integrate personalized services and digital tools into the experience, like GlamLab, Ulta's virtual try-on tool that lets shoppers test out products before buying. Together, the two retailers have more than 100 million active loyalty program members across Target Circle and Ultamate Rewards, the companies said in a joint statement.


Target has long used partnerships with well-known brands to fuel sales. Target's beauty and household essentials segment accounted for 24% of sales for fiscal 2020.


"TGT seeks to appeal to customers that are interested in sophisticated styles and quality by offering fashion newness, trusted brands and exclusive designer labels such as Maternity by Liz Lange," Nelson wrote. "It also frequently collaborates with well-known designers such as Jason Wu and Missoni offering limited-time collections."

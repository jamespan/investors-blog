**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it stages a bullish rebound from its 10-week line as earnings growth accelerates.




The software stock is doing well at the moment, [delivering record sales and expanded profitability](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/adobe-earnings-q2-2020-adbe-stock/) in the most recent quarter, despite the coronavirus pandemic.


Its excellent stock market performance, which has seen it rise 35% so far in 2020, has earned it a spot on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) list.


Adobe Stock Analysis
--------------------



Shares rose 2.3% to 445.36 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Adobe stock tested its 50-day line for the first time since its late April/early May breakout. On a weekly chart, Adobe has been finding support at its 10-week line for a few weeks.


Shares are now buyable following a rebound from the 10-week line. With [pullbacks investors can reduce their risk](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/calculating-position-size-for-portfolio-management/) through appropriately sizing their position.


When you buy relatively close to the 10-week line, it is possible to buy a bigger stake than at a typical [breakout buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but with the same or even less risk.


Adobe is around 2% above its 10-week line right now. If you invest $5,000 you are risking 4% of the stake. This is because if you sell ADBE below the 10-week line — say 2% below at end of the week — that's only about a 4% loss, or roughly $200. This is less than the typical 7%-8% lost when following [traditional sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Adobe also is a short consolidation that could go on to form a new base with a [potential buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 470.71. It comes after the stock soared clear of a previous profit-taking zone, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is now off all-time highs, reflecting the ADBE stock consolidation. But that's after a long run of outperformance. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



Adobe Earnings Growth
---------------------


Adobe stock has a near-perfect [IBD Composite Rating of 98.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) The [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-adobe-inc-adbe.aspx) shows earnings are the cornerstone to this, with a perfect EPS Rating of 99. Over the past three quarters Adobe earnings growth has averaged out at 30%. This exceeds [CAN SLIM requirements.](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/)


Adobe earnings growth has been accelerating for the past four quarters, with a 34% gain in fiscal Q2. Analysts see EPS growth of 24% in 2020, and growth of 14% in 2021.


For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $2.40 a share on sales of $3.15 billion. In the year-earlier period, Adobe earnings were $2.05 a share on sales of $2.83 billion.


Adobe said its guidance factored in current macroeconomic conditions and continued impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.


This Factor Key For Adobe Stock
-------------------------------


Through expansion of its creative cloud strategy, data analytics and customer experience businesses, [Adobe is looking to enhance its long-term growth](https://news.adobe.com/press-release/corporate/adobe-leadership-creativity-digital-documents-and-customer-experience). In recent years, it has boosted recurring revenue by transitioning to a subscription model for its creative and analytics software solutions.


In fact one key factor flagged by analysts was the fact Adobe managed to post record annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the most recent quarter. This is a metric that shows how much revenue the company can expect based on software-as-a-service subscriptions.


JP Morgan analyst Sterling Auty, who rates Adobe stock as overweight with a 430 target, said the ARR numbers are important going forward.


"The beat in ARR and durability of Creative Cloud is likely to be well received by investors, as will the impressive margins and upside in EPS," he said in a note to clients.

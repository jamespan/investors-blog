Gas and oil exploration company **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as energy prices hold near multiyear highs though supply woes persist. Cimarex stock is near a buy point.




The Denver-based company's activities include drilling, completing and operating wells. Cimarex operates in the Permian Basin and midcontinent areas, as well as in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.


The company announced on May 24 that it had agreed to combine with **Cabot Oil & Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)) in an all-stock merger of equals.Â Upon completion of the deal, Cimarex shareholders will own 50.5% and Cabot shareholders will own 49.5%.


But the deal was not warmly welcomed by Wall Street or shareholders. Cimarex stock gapped down 7% after the announcement. Those opposing the merger say the companies do not have operational overlap. Cabot is a big Marcellus Shale gas operator in Appalachia.

Cimarex CEO Thomas Jorden hopes investors will come around once they better understand the merger, even if industry watchers say there's a decent chance the deal won't close.





"We kind of broke from the herd. This doesn't fit the model. And we understood that," he said at a J.P. Morgan energy conference on June 22. "We wrestled with a lot of things in our boardroom over this. And so a lot of the concerns that people had expressed were things that were not new to us ... but I'd say our conversations have been extremely constructive over the last few weeks."





Cimarex posted first-quarter EPS of $1.98, a whopping 241% surge vs. a year earlier, snapping several quarters of declines. Sales climbed 44% to $679 million.


The company reports Q2 earnings on Aug. 5. FactSet analysts expect EPS of $1.67 for Q2 on sales of $577 million, up from a year-earlier 51-cent loss and revenue of $249.4 million.

**Crude Oil Prices Near Highs**
-------------------------------


Meanwhile, Cimarex is buoyed by a reversal in energy prices. While oil prices had been coming down in the past few days, they rose Thursday amid the latest U.S. inventory data.


U.S. crude oil futures rose 1% to $72.94 a barrel amid another hefty decline in domestic crude and gasoline stockpiles. But earlier in the week, U.S. crude oil prices set a six-year best.


U.S. crude inventory fell by 6.9 million barrels for the week ending July 2, according the [latest EIA report](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/pdf/wpsrall.pdf).


Oil prices have fallen in recent days after negotiations collapsed among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. The de facto leader of the group, known as OPEC+, Saudi Arabia refused demands from the United Arab Emirates to raise the amount it produced under a pact to cut supplies at the start of the pandemic in 2020. At the time, OPEC+ had cut oil production as oil prices plunged amid a global industrial shutdown.


OPEC+ is still holding back nearly 6 million barrels per day of output. The group had a [tentative agreement to gradually add 2 million barrels a day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/oil-holds-gain-near-73-as-market-waits-for-opec-output-meeting?sref=FwsjHXQj) to its output between August and December. The plan also called for extending their overall agreement to curb supply to December 2022 from April 2022. But the deal fell apart. And the group has yet to agree to another meeting.


The lack of an OPEC+ deal to boost production should tighten supplies, at least in the short run. But there are concerns that a long-term OPEC+ fracture could lead to various members ramping up output, sending prices sharply lower.

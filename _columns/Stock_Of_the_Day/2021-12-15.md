**Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the highflying medical research stock bounces off its 50-day moving average. Icon stock is nearing a new buy point.




The medical researcher is a partner for big drug and device makers. These companies outsource their development and commercialization services to companies like Icon. Icon helps identify which drugs to move into clinical testing, and then helps run those studies. Icon also recently closed its $12 billion acquisition of contract researcher PRA Health Sciences.


Jeremie Capron, director of research and managing partner at research firm Robo Global, calls Icon and similar companies in the drug and device development space "enablers." These companies are in the background of development.


"It's important to not just invest in the final solution providers, but the enablers as well," he said in an interview. "The value can accrue in different parts of the value chain over time."

Icon Stock: Investing In 'Enablers'
-----------------------------------


On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Icon stock jumped 4.6% to close at 287.31.


Shares are consolidating with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 301.82, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Icon stock just bounded off its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Another buy zone is around 290 to 292.


The company belongs to Investor's Business Daily's Medical-Research/Equipment industry group. On a year-to-date basis, shares of that group have popped 22%. The group itself is ranked No. 93 from top of the 197 groups IBD tracks. This is less promising, as shares have trended down since early November.


But Icon stock is a leader in its group. Shares rank fourth out of 42, and are only about 6% off record highs.


Robo Global's Capron compares companies like Icon to the providers of pans in the California Gold Rush. A single person panning for gold might not strike it rich, but the provider of pans is still selling en masse. That's also true for Icon as it helps test and develop drugs.


Integration With PRA Ongoing
----------------------------


Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson has an outperform rating on Icon stock.


Last month, she said the integration with PRA Health Sciences is paying off with a strong start "and customer interest in the new, more-scaled Icon." She expects Covid-related sales to normalize in late 2022. Icon is involved in testing for vaccines and antivirals, she said.


Still, Icon stock analysts are bullish on growth prospects. For the current December-ending quarter, they project adjusted profit of $2.54 per share, growing nearly 34%. FactSet didn't provide a revenue estimate. In the third quarter, revenue soared 167% to $1.87 billion.


Icon stock also has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). This puts it among the top 5% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical growth measures. Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92, putting its 12-month performance in the top 8% of all stocks.

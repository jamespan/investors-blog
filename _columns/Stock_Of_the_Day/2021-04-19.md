Rio Tinto is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Shares of the British-Australian mining giant are in a [cup base,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) amid a broader rebound for mining stocks.




The setup for the company, which mines materials like iron ore, copper and aluminum, comes as commodity demand rebounds with the broader economy, even as environmental concerns grow for the industry. Other mining stocks have also risen or were close to buy zones.


Rio Tinto Stock
---------------


**Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) closed up 1.8% at86.30 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). The stock was in a cup base with an 88.83 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares have a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 96. Rio Tinto stock has a less-than-ideal [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/news/rio-tinto-stock-rides-mining-boom-reflected-in-rising-rs-rating/) of 72.


The rally is also notable in that related stocks were largely down Monday, with the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF ([XME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XME)) down 1.2%. RIO stock's relative strength line is also spiking.


Copper miner **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), which has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, was down 2.1% to 37.33 as it tries to break out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 37.71 buy point.


Elsewhere, Brazil's **Vale** ([VALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VALE)), a recent [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vale-stock-sets-up-new-buy-point-as-commodities-surge/), lost 0.5%. But **BHP** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) added 0.5% and was in a consolidation. Those two stocks also have 99 Composite Ratings.


IBD's Mining-Metal Ores group, of which those mining stocks are members, holds a No. 20 Ranking out of the 197 industries tracked, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/?src=APA1BQ).


Along with the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, fiscal stimulus, a possible green infrastructure push and demand from China have helped lift prices for materials like copper, nickel and iron ore. Analysts have [questioned how long that uptrend can last](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/mining-stocks-fcx-stock-biden-green-infrastructure/).


Still, more demand for electric vehicles, which use a lot of copper, and lithium-ion batteries could spur more demand for those raw materials. Bridges and other infrastructure need steel, which requires iron ore.

Mining Stocks, China, ESG
-------------------------


However, like other mining stocks, Rio Tinto, as Bloomberg [noted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/rio-tinto-s-next-chair-must-navigate-between-china-and-australia?sref=FwsjHXQj), faces pressures to become more environmentally conscious. Vale has had to deal with the fallout of two mining disasters in Brazil over the past several years.


Friction between Australia and China, Rio's largest customer, will also pose challenges, Bloomberg said.


Even as mining stocks rise, Rio last year saw executives resign after the company destroyed two ancient Aboriginal caves in Western Australia in an effort to reach the iron ore beneath. The sites were located in the Juukan Gorge. Their destruction drew increasing anger from investors.


"What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation," the company said in a statement in September.

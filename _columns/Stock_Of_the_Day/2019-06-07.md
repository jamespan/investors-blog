Microsoft Stock Regains $1 Trillion Market Value
------------------------------------------------


With its latest stock move, Microsoft regained a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. As such, it is now the world's most valuable company.


On [April 24](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-q3-2019-earnings/), the Redmond, Wash.-based software leader reported better-than-expected results for the March quarter. It credited cloud computing strength for the outperformance in its fiscal third quarter.


Microsoft's cloud computing offerings include Azure infrastructure services, Dynamics business software and Office 365 productivity software. Its commercial cloud revenue rose 41% year over year to $9.6 billion in the March quarter.


Microsoft Focusing On Cloud Computing Partnerships
--------------------------------------------------


Lately Microsoft has been racking up notable partnerships to bolster its standing as the No. 2 cloud infrastructure vendor behind Amazon Web Services, a unit of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


On [Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-rises-cloud-partnership-oracle/), Microsoft and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) announced a partnership that will allow their cloud computing systems to interoperate.


"The partnership looks like a smart strategic move for Microsoft to further expand its ecosystem and partnership tentacles," Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a report Thursday. Microsoft Azure is "clearly in offensive mode" against Amazon Web Services, he said.


"With cloud representing 32% of all workloads today and moving to 55% by 2022, based on our estimates, now is the time for Microsoft to expand partnerships such as Oracle as it further flexes its muscles on cloud deployments across the board over the next 12 to 18 months," Ives said.


Ives rates Microsoft stock as outperform with a price target of 155.


In recent months, Microsoft also has forged or expanded alliances with **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)), **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)), **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) and **Sony** ([SNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNE)).

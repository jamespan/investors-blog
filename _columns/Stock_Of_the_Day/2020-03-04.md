Datadog is the IBD [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the enterprise software maker finds support at its 10-week moving average amid coronavirus-driven volatility. With the market correction, Datadog stock has dipped into a buy zone after a big run-up following its initial public offering.




The 10-week moving average serves as a key area of potential support. Why? Institutions will use that moving average to add shares to existing positions. But keep in mind that while the stock market is in a correction, all stock purchases are highly risky.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/), Datadog scores a relative strength of 86 out of a possible 99. Its relative strength line has been flattish and is not far from record highs despite the market correction.


The relative strength line [compares a stock's price action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to that of the S&P 500. A rising line means the stock is outperforming the benchmark index.


The Datadog IPO in September raised $648 million, with 24 million shares priced at 27. The IPO lockup period, when insiders can sell shares, expires on March 17.

Datadog Stock: Supply Chain Safe From Coronavirus
-------------------------------------------------


Heading into the Datadog earnings report last month, shares were extended from a [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 43.62 out of a [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Datadog stock hit an all-time high of 50.12 in intraday trading Feb. 12.


Amid high expectations, Datadog stock pulled back 3% after it reported fourth-quarter earnings late Feb. 13. Datadog stock found support the next two trading sessions, then tumbled as worries over the spreading coronavirus mounted.


Datadog isn't the only [enterprise software stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/saas-stocks-cloud-stocks/) with a solid relative strength line amid the market correction. Others include **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), which is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), as well as **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


One reason could be stellar revenue growth. Datadog's fourth-quarter revenue soared 85% to $113.6 million, topping estimates of $102.4 million for the period ended Dec. 31.


In addition, unlike semiconductor firms and hardware makers, software companies are unaffected by disruptions in supply chains tied to the spreading China coronavirus.


Datadog Outlook: Rivals Include Cisco, New Relic, Splunk
--------------------------------------------------------


Datadog stock has dropped 11% from its all-time high. While Datadog stock is now in a buy zone, investors may want to wait until global markets calm down. Also, there's the IPO lockup expiration to consider. Shares were up 3.1% in afternoon trades Wednesday to 44.74.


Founded in 2010, Datadog operates a monitoring and analytics platform for software developers and information-technology departments. Developers and IT operations teams use its cloud-based tools to monitor software applications and computer infrastructure.


Customers access its cloud platform via the internet. They include Airbnb, **Walt Disney**'s ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) 21st Century Fox unit, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Amazon.com**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Whole Foods.


With Datadog's tools, they aim to bring new applications to market faster and monitor app performance and track key business metrics.


Some customers use Datadog tools to track applications running at cloud service providers, such as the Amazon Web Services of Amazon, or **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Azure.


In addition, Datadog competes with **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), which acquired AppDynamics as well as many startups.


Datadog CEO Speaks At Conference
--------------------------------


For full-year 2020, Datadog on Feb. 13 forecast revenue of $540 million, about 49% growth. While that topped estimates of $503 million, some investors were looking for more.


Further, Datadog Chief Executive Olivier Pomel spoke at a Morgan Stanley technology conference this week in San Francisco.


"Highlighting the natural competitive advantage of landing with its market-leading Infrastructure Monitoring product, Mr. Pomel noted that the company is seeing an acceleration in the rate of multi-product adoption," Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a report to clients.


Weiss added that "bodes well for Datadog's ability to upsell its current product portfolio to the remainder of its installed base of 10,000-plus customers."

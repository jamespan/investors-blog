**S&P Global** ([SPGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPGI)), the market-research and debt-rating firm, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). SPGI stock, which is on IBD's Long-Term Leaders watchlist, has bounced off its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), giving investors a chance to pick up a stock that has racked up three straight quarters of earnings growth.




The gains for the stock come as more companies borrow more money to stay afloat during the coronavirus' shutdown of daily life. Central banks, meanwhile, have bought more bonds to prop up the economy.


SPGI Stock
----------


S&P Global rose 2% to 356.13 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). That's about 4.5% above the 10-week moving average, within range for investors who want to add shares or start a new position.


S&P Global also began a consolidation pattern in July. The stock was recently in a [four-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), with a 360.10 entry. The pattern could eventually morph into a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). However, SPGI stock tends to trade tightly anyway, making moments when it settles less meaningful.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has fallen over the past month, as S&P Global stock consolidated. But the RS line has advanced solidly over the last several years, reflecting SPGI's outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.



S&P Global Earnings Growth Picks Up
-----------------------------------


S&P Global earnings rose by 14% in the fourth quarter, followed by a 29% gain in Q1 and a 40% gain in Q2. The company has notched earnings gains since 2013, and is expected to put up a 15% gain this year, even as the coronavirus pandemic guts the bottom line for many companies.


However, S&P Global late last month said the pandemic led to a "surge" of corporate bond issuance during the second quarter, as businesses raised debt to pad themselves financially. The flood of issuances means more debt for S&P Global to evaluate. The company makes money off of those ratings, which investors use to determine how risky that debt is.


"Companies, particularly in the U.S., have turned to the bond market to raise liquidity during this COVID-19 pandemic while central banks have initiated bond purchase programs to support market liquidity," the company said in its second-quarter earnings release.


Revenue in S&P Global's ratings business jumped 26%. The company cited "record quarterly U.S. investment-grade issuance."


SPGI stock has a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 98.


Prior to the pandemic, low interest rates from the Fed cut borrowing costs, making it easier for corporations and governments to borrow. That, along with greater demand for market data, hasÂ [helped lift SPGI stock](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/data-debt-market-research-stocks/).


Rival **Moody's Investors Service** ([MCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCO)) added 1.2%, regaining support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Moody's earnings and revenue growth have both accelerated for the past two quarters.

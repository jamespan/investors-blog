Hexcel stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The aerospace and defense contractor is setting up in a bullish consolidation as its relative strength line hits a new high. Hexcel is one of several top defense stocks, including industry giants **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) and **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)), and suppliers **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and **L3 Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)).




**Hexcel** ([HXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HXL)) supplies adhesives and composites for over 100 military aircraft programs including the Lockheed Martin F-35, the **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) F/A-18E/F Hornet and the Eurofighter Typhoon. It also provides supplies for commercial aircraft like the Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner.


Hexcel Stock Flashing Bullish Signs
-----------------------------------


Shares erased early losses, climbed 0.1% to 84.21 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The aerospace parts supplier is consolidating in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with an 85.73 entry point. That follows a 60% run for Hexcel stock from its Dec. 26 low to its July 23 peak.


A flat base can be as short as five weeks, but can be much longer. The depth can be no more than 15%. The base is particularly bullish in weak or choppy stock markets like today's amid rising China trade tensions and global growth fears.


Meanwhile the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) for Hexcel stock is already hitting new highs, a bullish sign. The RS line compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500. It's the blue line in the chart below.


But if major indexes lose ground, even leading stocks will struggle to hold up, let alone break out to new highs.



Hexcel Stock Fundamentals
-------------------------


In July, the aerospace parts supplier reported quarterly revenue grew 11% to $609 million as Hexcel earnings rose 25% to 94 cents per share, both beating views. [Hexcel also raised its dividend](https://www.investors.com/news/f35-supplier-hexcel-earnings-q2-2019-buy-point/) and full-year profit guidance.


Hexcel earnings have risen by an annual average of 11% over the last three years while revenue has climbed 6% a year. Those figures are below the 25% gain desired for [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) investing requirements. But Hexcel earnings growth has accelerated for the past four quarters.


Hexcel is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Aerospace/Defense Group, which is rated 10th out of 197 industries that IBD tracks. It has a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and a 92 EPS Rating, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-hexcel-corp-hxl.aspx) tool.


Defense Stocks Strong
---------------------


Hexcel stock is on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), along with Heico stock and L3 Harris stock. Northrop Grumman stock and aerospace supplier **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) are [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stocks.


Lockheed Martin stock and Heico stock are in [three-weeks-tight patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) while L3 Harris stock is in a four weeks tight. Northrop stock and TransDigm are consolidating near record highs.


Defense stocks have little direct exposure to the escalating China trade war that rattled markets Tuesday. The China trade war expanded with new [Trump tariffs on Sunday](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-will-trump-blink-dow-jones/).

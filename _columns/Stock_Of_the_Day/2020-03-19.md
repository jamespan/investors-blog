**FTI Consulting** ([FCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the coronavirus stock market crash sends other companies reeling and the economy into a tailspin.




FTI is a Washington, D.C.-based consulting company. It was the consulting firm for Lehman Brothers' creditors in 2012 and made $81 million in fees. It was also involved with the **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) bankruptcy restructuring.


The aviation, cruise, restaurant and hotel industries are looking for government bailouts over the coronavirus stock market crash as cities enter lockdown across the world. FTI could see new business amid the turmoil of corporate restructuring.


The Covid-19 version of coronavirus has weighed on the broader market but there are some stocks still seeing strengthening technical measures.

Shares fell 8.8% to close at 120.13 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) but found support at the 50-day line.

The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500. When the line is trending higher, it means the stock is outperforming the index.

FTI is the top-ranked stock in the Commercial Services-Consulting Group. It has a Composite Rating of 98 out of a best possible 99. That means the company is now outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria. FTI has an 88 EPS Rating.


Over the past three years, EPS growth has averaged 58%, but it had a 4% decline in the latest quarter. FTI sales growth was 10% over the last three years. Sales were up 19% last quarter. Investors should look at stocks with at least 25% growth rates.

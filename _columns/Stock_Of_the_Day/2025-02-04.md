S&P 500 component **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the retailer appears unaffected by President Donald Trump's ongoing trade negotiations, rebounding from a key support level Monday and advancing toward buy points in Tuesday's stock market action.


The multinational retail operator, which owns TJ Maxx and Marshalls, edged higher Tuesday even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major stock indexes traded mixed, as China retaliated modestly against President Trump's tariff hike.


TJX is an off-price apparel and home goods retailer, getting most of its merchandise from other chains.




TJX closes the book on its fiscal 2025 at the end of February with analysts expecting profit to grow 8% to $4.19 with revenue increasing 3.6%, according to FactSet. The company expects full-fiscal year EPS of $4.15-$4.17. TJX also forecasts comparable sales for 3% growth.


On Nov. 20 TJX reported better-than-expected financials with an 11% increase in Q3 2025 earnings while net sales increased 6%.


Consolidated comparable sales for the quarter rose 3% to match analyst views. Same store sales for TJX International increased 7%.


"Across the company, customer transactions drove our comp sales increases, which tells us that our values and treasure-hunt shopping experience are appealing to a wide range of customers," Chief Executive Ernie Herrman said at the time.

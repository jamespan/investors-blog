**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) ahead of its fiscal second-quarter earnings report due late Tuesday. Heading into earnings, the stock has neared an entry point amid some other bullish signs.




Palo Alto stock has formed a [cup chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-basics-analyze-both-daily-weekly-stock-charts/) over six months. It has a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 239.60. Shares climbed 1.6% Monday to close at 233.88


Palo Alto has a [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95 out of a possible 99. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, with a rising line pointing to outperformance. The company's RS line has hit a new high in this most recent base, and did so ahead of earnings. That's a bullish sign.


Still, buying before earnings is risky, even when the broad stock market rallies. Palo Alto stock plunged 24% in March 2017 when guidance disappointed.

Shares bottomed in April 2017 before embarking on a strong run. As enterprise software stocks fell in late 2018, Palo Alto took a tumble as well.


Palo Alto Earnings Rise Seen At 42%
-----------------------------------


IBD's Computer-Software Security group has bounced back and now [ranks No. 13 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-feb-22-2019/). It was ranked No. 62 about 13 weeks ago.


An [earnings options strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/options-trading-analog-devices-stock/) is always good to consider. A basic options trading strategy around earnings using call options allows you to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk.


A strong earnings report can sometimes send a stock catapulting out of a good base. Learn more about [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) here.


Palo Alto earnings are projected to rise 42% to $1.22, with revenue climbing 26% to $682 million.


Palo Alto Expands From Firewall Market
--------------------------------------


"With shares up some 27% over the past three months, investor sentiment has bounced off recent lows, gaining back ground lost to fears around the new management team, as well as improving views on security growth prospects in 2019," Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a recent note to clients.


Palo Alto primarily competes in the "firewall" network security market, facing off against **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and others. Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from entering a private network and monitor web-based apps.


Palo Alto has been building a broader cybersecurity platform through acquisitions. The cybersecurity firm last week agreed to buy Demisto for $560 million in cash and stock. In earlier deals, it bought Redlock for $173 million and Evident.io for $300 million.


Changes in Palo Alto Sales Channels
-----------------------------------


One overhang on Palo Alto stock has been that its new chief executive could be mulling a much bigger acquisition. CEO Nikesh Arora, a former top executive at Alphabet-unit Google, took the helm at Palo Alto in June.


Another area of concern is that Palo Alto's product distribution strategy is being overhauled, UBS analyst Fatima Boolani said in a Feb. 14 report. Boolani says Palo Alto aims to pare down its reseller base of value-added resellers in 2019.


At the same time, Palo Alto is focused on gain share in cloud computing-cased security, Boolani said.

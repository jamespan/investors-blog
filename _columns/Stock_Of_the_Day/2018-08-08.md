**Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) is the IBD Stock Of The Day. The rural-Western-themed retail chain broke out on Wednesday, a day after it reported [better-than-expected quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/crocs-earnings-boot-barn-earnings/) and lifted its full-year profit outlook.

Shares of the company — which sells cowboy boots, straw hats, work boots and work apparel — blasted 14.7% higher to close at 26.65 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), clearing a 25.55 buy point of a handle on a cup base in heavy volume. Boot Barn had already broken out of a consolidation in May.


The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a best-possible 99. Its Relative Strength line, a measure of a stock's performance against the S&P 500, is at its highest level in nearly three years.


'Hidden In Plain Sight'
-----------------------


Boot Barn has 232 stores in 31 states. Like other retailers, it has been trying to grow its e-commerce business. During a conference in June, Boot Barn CEO Jim Conroy pitched the company as a play for Middle America.


"Boot Barn operates in this massive retail opportunity that we often say has been hidden in plain sight for 100 years," he said.


"So if you were to fly from New York to Los Angeles and look out the airplane window for five and a half hours," he continued, "that six-hour flight, you're looking down at our customer. And that customer wears boots and jeans and cowboy hats . . . and the products that we carry."

The vast majority of its sales are done at full-price, Conroy said, helping the company stay above the discounting fray of other retailers.


A rebounding oil industry has helped same-store sales, he said. In an investor presentation, the company also cited the popularity of country music and events like rodeos as being among the "drivers of western wear growth."

Shares in Wix have been climbing since the mid-December rollout of its new Ascend-branded marketing tools. The tools, aimed at small businesses, complement Wix's website design and hosting services.


"Given that Ascend is an add-on product, the free cash flow and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin contribution from the offering should be arguably meaningfully higher than core," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Naved Khan said in a recent note to clients.


Wix Stock: Main Rival Is GoDaddy
--------------------------------


The tools "bode well for overall profitability, lifetime value as well as marketing efficiency," he added.


The Ascend promotion tools include internet SEO, email marketing, and integration with products like Google Analytics. In addition, Ascend offers live chat and other tools.


Wix's main rival has been **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)). With the Ascend tools, it's encroaching on **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and others in online marketing.


Matthew Pfau, a William Blair analyst, also has an upbeat view.


"The main goal of the Ascend platform is to help small businesses drive visitors to their websites and convert these individuals into customers," Pfau said in his note.


The website creation service went public in 2013.

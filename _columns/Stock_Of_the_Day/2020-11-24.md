Package deliverer **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). FedEx stock broke out of a base on Tuesday, with the broader market, after President Trump's government began to clear the way for President-elect Biden to begin his postelection transition.




Tuesday's breakout also arrived after FedEx swooped higher this year, as the coronavirus pandemic creates a boom in online shopping and residential shipments. And it comes ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season, which will likely rely more on delivery, as physical stores face occupancy limits and customers more likely to stay indoors.


FedEx Stock
-----------


FedEx stock rose 1.9% to 291.68 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today). Intraday, shares rose as high as 296.08, breaking out from a 293.40 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a short [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/).


Investors could have also taken a position in [FDX stock](https://www.investors.com/news/fedex-stock-buy-now/) when it bounced off its 10-week line in recent weeks. That line is a key test of investor support. Investors can buy stocks off the first or second rebound from the 10-week line, as long as they are within 10% of that line.


Investors could also have used 289.86 — 10 cents above the intraday high on Nov. 18 — as a quasi-handle entry Tuesday before FDX stock cleared the official buy point.


FedEx stock has a stellar 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 71.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for FDX stock is near a record high, after a sharp increase from the coronavirus crash lows to a two-year high. The RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



Among other transportation stocks, rival **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)), up 3.7%, rebounding from a 10-week line within its own flat base. UPS stock is actionable, but the RS line has lagged in recent weeks relative to FedEx's. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has slipped below that support level. Amazon stock climbed 0.6%, approaching its 50-day line, but its RS line is at five-month lows.


FedEx Gets Coronavirus Boost
----------------------------


FedEx has invested in expanding its ground delivery network in the U.S. and refined its technology infrastructure over the years to handle more demand for e-commerce, as well as bulkier items like furniture and exercise equipment, the company has said. In May, FedEx announced an alliance with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) to use the software giant's cloud and AI resources to improve deliveries to commercial customers.


The coronavirus pandemic put those resources to the test, as e-commerce shopping skyrocketed.


FedEx COO Rajesh Subramaniam, in September, said that "The growth that we expected to see over a period of three to five years happened in a period of three to five months."


Subramaniam said that the holiday season would be "like no other in our company's history." He added that the company would add 70,000 positions in big markets in the U.S., and expand ground facilities, including new automated stations.


Coronavirus Vaccine Shipments
-----------------------------


Stephens analysts who cover FedEx stock said the company could also play a big role in getting a coronavirus vaccine to patients.


"We fully expect FDX will be among the most active participants in COVID-19 vaccine logistics," the analysts said in a research note this month. "We believe the Company has been working with pharmaceutical manufacturers for some time, and believe it will be ready to begin distribution when approval is granted."


"Regardless of which vaccine is approved, and the respective cold storage requirements, we believe FDX currently possesses the capabilities and approvals to accommodate those during transport," they said.

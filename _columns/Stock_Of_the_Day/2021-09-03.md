**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cloud software provider surges after posting a strong quarterly report. DOCU stock is near record high territory.




The San Francisco-based company late Thursday said it earned an adjusted 47 cents a share on sales of $511.8 million in its [fiscal second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/docusign-stock-falls-earnings-beat-revenue-outlook-edges-by-estimates/) ended July 31. Analysts expected DocuSign earnings of 40 cents a share on sales of $488.7 million. On a year-over-year basis, earnings soared 176% while sales jumped 50%.


For its current quarter ending Oct. 31, DocuSign forecast revenue of $529 million at the midpoint of its outlook. Analysts had projected sales of $522 million. Sales in the year-earlier period were $382.9 million.


DocuSign's electronic-signatures offering has helped companies during the remote work environment spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Executive Dan Springer said in a [news release](https://www.docusign.com/press-releases/docusign-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-2022-financial-results).

DocuSign Shifting Contracts Online
----------------------------------


"Organizations of all types and sizes are leveraging the power of the (DocuSign) Agreement Cloud to digitize the most foundational process of doing business — the agreement process — starting with eSignature," Springer said. "In partnership with our customers, we are eliminating paper, automating end-to-end agreement processes, and enabling better experiences in the anywhere economy."


The company's software automates the filing of contracts over the internet and certifies electronic signatures.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), DOCU stock jumped 5.3% to close at 310.05.


DOCU Stock Breaks Out
---------------------


On Friday, DOCU stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 310.61, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts, then slipped just below that point. Shares tested that buy point on Aug. 10 when DOCU stock reached a record high 314.76. But [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-trading-know-these-3-basics-about-a-stocks-trading-volume/) was well below average and shares reversed, ending the day down 1.7%.


DOCU stock is still buyable off its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) and [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) of the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) extends to 326.14, based on [IBD trading principles](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


Strong Growth Post-Covid Peak
-----------------------------


Several Wall Street analysts noted that DocuSign continues to show strong growth even after the peak Covid period.


"DocuSign posted further evidence that while it benefited during the pandemic, it has a long tail of sustainable growth," UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said in a note to clients. He kept his buy rating on DOCU stock and raised his price target to 350 from 340.


DocuSign is becoming a "virtual contract management juggernaut," Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to clients. He reiterated his outperform rating on DOCU stock with a price target of 340.


Corporate tech buyers are prioritizing DocuSign's e-signature platform and solution set, Ives said. Its products service a clear need for remote workers, he said.


"With a 'new normal' and still heavy remote workforce on the horizon for the foreseeable future, we believe this backdrop has markedly accelerated DocuSign's ability to further penetrate existing as well as new customers," Ives said.

Macy's Stock Rebounds
---------------------


After a long slide brought on by worries over the threat of e-commerce and the coronavirus pandemic, Macy's stock began rebounding late last year. The economy's reopening, stimulus checks and savings amassed by many people stuck at home helped prop up consumer spending.


However, the back-to-school shopping season ran up against rising Covid cases, driven by the delta variant. As the nation heads into the holiday shopping season, the decline in U.S. coronavirus cases that began in September has more recently leveled off.


Still, the National Retail Federation says it expects holiday sales, during November and December, to rise 8.5%- 10.5%, to a range of $843.4 billion and $859 billion. The group said there was "considerable momentum" heading into the holiday season.


Supply Chain Difficulties
-------------------------


But that demand could chafe against issues with the world's supply chain. Delays and shipping prices have spiked amid Covid-related shutdowns in Asia, backups at ports and warehouses, and moves by workers to take their skills elsewhere or demand more of their employers.


During a conference with a Macy's stock analyst in September, management said it was "comfortable" with its ability to keep inventory on hand, even though it expects inventory levels to remain lean until at least the middle of next year.


Management said that supply-chain issues were more pronounced in apparel and footwear, particularly women's shoes. It wasn't as concerned about categories like beauty, jewelry and some home goods.


CFO Adrian Mitchell said "We believe that the most significant lever we have to manage the supply chain challenges is really our strong vendor relationships, which help support the actions that we're taking with regards to the supply chain."


He added, "We're working closely also with ocean carrier partners to maximize our capacity and, where possible, minimize disruptions."

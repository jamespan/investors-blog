Steel producer **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). MT stock is near a buy point ahead of its second-quarter earnings on Thursday.




Those earnings will arrive after a rebounding economy has pushed steel prices higher, and as the company tries to cut costs. Other steel stocks have also settled into consolidations.


MT Stock
--------


ArcelorMittal stock is in a consolidation with a 34.06 entry. But IBD's research indicates that investors looking to buy the stock should hold off on doing so until after the company reports earnings.


The relative strength line is also approaching recent highs, after MT stock bounced above its 50-day line Monday, a bullish signal.


Shares of the company closed down 0.3% at 33.58 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today).


MT stock has a 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). IBD suggests investors should focus on stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or higher. The stock's EPS Rating is 68. IBD's Steel-Producers group holds a ranking of No. 4 out of 197 industry groups tracked.


Among other steel stocks, **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) fell 1.3%. **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) edged up less than 0.1% to 61.09. That stock was in a consolidation with a 66.98 entry.


**Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) rose 1.1% to 22.26. That stock was also in a consolidation with a 24.87 entry. ArcelorMittal in December sold nearly all of its U.S. operations to Cleveland-Cliffs.

'Positive Market Dynamics'
--------------------------


ArcelorMittal is a steelmaking giant across the Americas, Europe and Africa. Its mining operations also produce iron ore, a key ingredient in steel. The company's steel products are used by a wide range of industries — from automobiles to appliances and construction.


When the company reports Thursday, analysts who follow MT stock expect the company to earn $2.36 per share, up from a loss a year ago, according to FactSet. Revenue is expected to jump 72% to $16.03 billion.


"Operationally, we have had a very positive start to the year," CEO Aditya Mittal said when the company reported first-quarter results in May.


Mittal continued: "We are seeing a continuation of the positive market dynamics of the fourth quarter and have been steadily bringing back production, in line with the demand recovery, which is supported by low inventory levels through the value chain."

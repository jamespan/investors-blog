Veritiv([VRTV]) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the company capitalizes on the Covid packaging boom to reposition its business and improve its credit profile. VRTV stock neared a buy point last week as it posted record Q1 earnings and raised guidance.




On May 6, Atlanta-based Vertiv reported Q1 EPS of $1.28 vs. a 2-cent year-ago loss. The only analyst who covers the stock had expected earnings of 2 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research.


While revenue fell 9% to $1.559 billion, a more favorable product mix and cost controls delivered the upside surprise. Packaging sales increased 6.5% from the year-ago quarter, boosted by demand and pricing, despite one less shipping day.


Vertiv's other segments are engaged in publishing, printing and supplying facilities from offices to arenas to hospitals. While Covid stay-at-home trends hit the facilities-supply segment, the other segments face secular declines.


Vertiv is focused on building up the higher-growth, higher-margin opportunities, while better managing the costs of less dynamic segments. Packaging grew from 41% of sales in 2018 to 52% in 2020.

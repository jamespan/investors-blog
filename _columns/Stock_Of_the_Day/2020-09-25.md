**JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), one of the largest e-commerce companies in China. JD.com stock has pulled back from record highs after a long run but remains one to watch.




The company reported second-quarter results on Aug. 17 that beat estimates, leading to a breakout for JD.com stock with a buy point of 69.28. The stock quickly moved above the high end of the buy range of 72.74, however.


It reached a record high of 86.58 on Sept. 2. Since then, the stock has fallen about 14%, but in an orderly fashion despite the sell-off of tech stocks in the past few weeks. Shares jumped 2.7%to close at 74.67 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


As things currently stand with the decline in JD.com stock, it's edging nearer to the 50-day moving average. But if it holds above the line, that would indicate a level of support.

JD.com stock has more than doubled this year.


Customer Growth Jumps
---------------------


JD.com offers a vast selection of products, across every major category. This includes electronics, apparel, home furnishings and appliances as well as fresh food.


Among highlights in the [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-com-earnings-q2-jd-stock-alibaba-rival/), active annual customers jumped 30% to 417.4 million from the year-ago period. Mobile daily active users grew 40%.


Revenue climbed 30% to $28.5 billion, which was about $1 billion above estimates. The company has achieved double-digit revenue growth every quarter going back several years and has been consistently profitable.


In the company's recent quarterly earnings conference call, JD.com Chief Financial Officer Sandy Xu mentioned challenges the company faced during the pandemic.


"We were facing a constantly evolving macro-environment with unprecedented complexity and opportunity," she said. "As the domestic consumption is slowly recovering from the disruption brought by the pandemic, both the release of pent-up demand and a structural shift of consumer purchasing behavior from offline to online have added to our strong performance in the quarter."


JD.com competes mainly against **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) in the e-commerce field. In addition, it's also transforming to become a leading supply-chain-based technology and service provider.

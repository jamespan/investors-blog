**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as VRTX stock offers new buying opportunities following the launch of a key cystic fibrosis treatment.




The [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) is a powerhouse in treating cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease of the lungs and digestive system. Vertex makes four cystic fibrosis treatments. In October, the Food and Drug Administration [approved Trikafta](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vertex-stock-jumps-biotech-company-fda-nod-cystic-fibrosis-treatment/), which promises to treat 90% of all patients.


During the [fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vrtx-stock-vertex-pharmaceuticals-earnings-q4-2019/), Trikafta generated $420 million in sales. But VRTX stock slipped the day following the Jan. 30 report. Analysts noted that Trikafta's strength came at the detriment of Vertex's other cystic fibrosis treatments: Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi.


Eventually, Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden says, the goal is to have the [majority of cystic fibrosis patients on Trikafta](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/biotech-company-vertex-pharmaceuticals-treating-cystic-fibrosis-vertex-stock/). Clinical studies show Trikafta is more effective than the other cystic fibrosis treatments Vertex sells, he told Investor's Business Daily in a recent interview.

"There will be a few patients who stay on Kalydeco, Symdeko or Orkambi because they like it so much and they don't want to switch," he said. "But the vast, vast majority of the patients will simply transition over to Trikafta. So Trikafta will end up being the single medicine that treats up to 90% of patients."


VRTX Stock Rebounds Off 50-Day Line
-----------------------------------


Following the fourth-quarter earnings report, VRTX [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) slipped 1.4% on Jan. 31. But the biotech stock found support at — and rebounded off — its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Of note, Vertex stock never closed below its [four-weeks tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) entry at 225.76.


In addition, shares have also climbed above prior record highs, offering an additional but higher [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 237.57. Shares were down marginally Thursday 239.12.


Analysts offered myriad views on VRTX stock following the fourth-quarter report. Vertex earnings of $1.70 per share, on an adjusted basis, crushed the estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for 96 cents. Sales were $1.41 billion, well above views for $1 billion.


On a year-over-year basis, earnings popped 31% and sales rocketed 62%. That puts VRTX stock in line with [CAN SLIM rules for investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Savvy investors should look for companies with recent [earnings and sales growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-c-in-can-slim-why-current-earnings-matter-so-much/) of 20% to 25%. The bigger, the better.


RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams credited the biotech stock for its strong Trikafta launch in cystic fibrosis treatment.


"Strong Trikafta launch out of the gate, orders of magnitude above consensus expectations, should help perpetuate enthusiasm for Vertex's commercial execution into 2020," he said in a recent report to clients. He kept his outperform rating on VRTX stock, but raised his price target by 20 to 260.


Strong Growth In Cystic Fibrosis Treatment
------------------------------------------


Vertex's revenue trajectory in cystic fibrosis treatment should accelerate, Abrahams said. He noted the launch of Trikafta impacted Kalydeco and Orkambi. Sales fell a respective 1.7% and 6.8% vs. the year-earlier period. But that's to be expected following the Trikafta launch.


"The launch clearly appears to be substantially expanding the company's overall revenue opportunity with new patients now being addressed and incremental revenue benefit from switchers (patients switching to Trikafta from other medicines)," he said.


SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted that Trikafta sales topped analysts' estimate by nearly 500%. In total, the quartet of cystic fibrosis treatments generated $1.26 billion in sales, rising 45% year over year. That also beat expectations. Sequentially, though, Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi lost steam.



"Based on the first quarter (of) performance, we believe Trikafta is likely to have a faster conversion from the CF drugs as well as a more rapid adoption in previously untreated CF patients," he said in a recent note to clients.


Porges kept his market perform rating on VRTX stock, and boosted his price target to 224 from 208.


What's Next For The Biotech Company?
------------------------------------


But Needham analyst Alan Carr is looking ahead of Vertex's future outside of cystic fibrosis treatments. The biotech company is currently testing treatments for a number of other diseases. Carr highlighted Vertex's efforts in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS.


Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a hereditary condition that can affect the lungs or liver. Vertex could have the results of a Phase 2 test of an experimental drug in 2020, he said. FSGS is a leading cause of kidney failure. Vertex is planning to start a midstage test in 2020.


Still, the biotech company is looking for the right target in pain treatment. The company [discontinued its efforts](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-reports-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2019-financial) with a drug known as VX-961 in Phase 1 development. So, when it comes to VRTX stock, Carr is looking for what's next.


"Substantial success in CF is already reflected in (the) stock," he said in a report.


VRTX Stock Is A Highly Rated Biotech
------------------------------------


Still, VRTX stock is highly rated, according to Investor's Business Daily's standards.


Shares are tied with **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) for first in the industry group of nearly 600 biotech companies. That's measured by [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). Both VRTX stock and REGN stock have Composite Ratings of 99. The 1-99 score puts VRTX stock in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.


Vertex stock also has a bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97. The RS Rating measures a stock's 12-month performance. So the leader in cystic fibrosis treatments ranks in the top 8% of all stocks in terms of its performance.


Vertex declined to comment beyond what was said on its fourth-quarter earnings conference call.

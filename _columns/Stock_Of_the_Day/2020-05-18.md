Tyler Stock: 2020 Guidance Withdrawn
------------------------------------


The software and services provider withdrew 2020 guidance. But management told analysts it can still achieve top-line growth in the mid-single digits for the year, with the operating margin flat with 2019.


Tyler's first-quarter revenue rose nearly 12% to $276.5 million. Profit rose 2% to $1.25 a share.


Tyler has been public since 1966. It shifted its focus to the public sector software market in 1997. Many local and state governments still use legacy software — such as COBOL and Visual BASIC — first installed in the 1980s or before. Tyler has upgraded software in over 26,000 locations.


Tyler has been growing subscription-based revenue. Recurring revenue from subscriptions and maintenance rose 17% to $196.1 million.


Although the company's 70% recurring revenue from subscription and maintenance is unlikely to be impacted by the coronavirus emergency, other areas may be affected, it told analysts. William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho, in a report, said Tyler is well positioned when the Covid-19 emergency eases.


State And Local Governments Face Budget Pressure
------------------------------------------------


"State and local budgets are likely to come under significant pressure, which we believe will lead to a period where contracts will likely be delayed, postponed, or deprioritized," said Ho. "However, these contracts eventually need to be filled, and we believe Tyler will be better positioned to address them as it keeps its workforce intact."


As of March 31, Tyler's backlog of signed contracts stood at $1.5 billion, up 19% from a year earlier.


"We're 70% recurring revenue, which is very solid – maintenance and subscriptions for mission-critical systems," Chief Financial Officer Brian Miller said in an email. "All of our software products run essential functions of government — 911, property taxes, courts & jails, utility billing, payroll, licensing and permitting."


Miller added: "Many of the systems currently being used are decades-old, and when they reach end of life, replacing them with a system from a current system like ours is a high priority, even in a difficult economic environment.  We expect that we will see some procurements delayed, but that ultimately the aging systems will be replaced."


Tyler has acquired 31 companies since 2006. It bought public sector data analytics firm Socrata for $150 million in 2018.


It purchased MicroPact for $197 million in 2019, moving further into the federal market.


On Tyler's earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Lynn Moore said the company will remain opportunistic in regard to deals. Moore said private equity firms have been rivals in the software sector.


Tyler Stock: Acquisitions Likely To Continue
--------------------------------------------


"I think the current environment may create some additional opportunities," Moore said. "We may see opportunities where we may have a few more motivated sellers. Some of their valuations may become more in line with what we think are reasonable."


She added: "Some of the competition for some of these deals, which in the last several years have been PE firms, we've talked about the leverage that they've got on their balance sheets and the issues this pandemic may cause for them. So we may be able to compete a little bit better on our terms."


Tyler offers professional IT services, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and product customization. In addition, Tyler provides outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions.


Tyler recently signed a deal with Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), to provide software via its cloud platform.


Tyler stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C-plus, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.

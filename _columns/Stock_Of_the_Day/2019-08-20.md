**Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of business spending management software touts a relative strength line holding at new highs amid recent stock market volatility. Coupa stock trades about 6% below its potential entry point, though there may be alternative buy opportunities.




Coupa's software products cover employee travel and expense management, procurement and invoicing. It's among a number of [financial technology stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fintech-companies-to-buy-and-watch/).


From a technical view, Coupa stock boasts an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) chart pattern that's tight along its 50-day and [10-week moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


From a fundamental view, Coupa is expected to swing to a 10-cent loss in the current July quarter. Analysts also project that adjusted earnings per share will fall to 11 cents in fiscal 2020 from 18 cents a year earlier. In fiscal 2021, analysts see EPS rebounding to 41 cents.

Coupa has been investing in new products, crimping profits in the near term. In November, it rolled out Coupa Pay, a business-to-business payment and financing product.


Coupa Stock: Software Maker Expands Into Payments
-------------------------------------------------


Coupa Pay enables companies to pay contractors, vendors and employees and provides cash-flow management. At the company's annual user conference in June, Coupa Pay held the spotlight.


The software maker announced new partnerships involving Coupa Pay with Citibank, **PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and startup Stripe. Coupa also said it will work with TransferMate for bank transfers and cross-border payments.


"Partners are excited about the possibilities Coupa Pay offers, although they are still in the early discovery phases of how to bring the product to market," Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky said in a recent note to clients.


At the user conference, Coupa also unveiled "Digital Checks." The product enables customers to send check images to an email address as a document. As a result, customers no longer need to put a check in the mail.


Meanwhile, Coupa recently acquired a startup with artificial-intelligence tools. Many fast-growing companies aim to get a [competitive edge using AI technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).


In April Coupa bought Exari, a provider of contract management software, for about $215 million in cash. The software maker expects Exari to contribute around $25 million in revenue in fiscal 2021.


Coupa Stock: The Technical View
-------------------------------


From a technical view, Coupa's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is holding near highs. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.


Typically, the strongest stocks' relative strength lines are either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground. The RS line is in blue in all IBD stock charts.


Coupa's daily chart shows an ascending base with a [148.10 buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Due to its tight pricing around the 50-day and 10-week lines, more aggressive investors may find an alternative entry if shares break past Monday's intraday high of 140.99. Coupa stock climbed 2.2% to close at 139.38 Tuesday.


An ascending base has three pullbacks, each ranging from 10% to 20%. Each pullback must mark a higher high and a higher low. An ascending base is a rare pattern that forms on some of the stock market's strongest growth stocks during a market cycle.


Coupa reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Sept. 3.


San Mateo, Calif.-based Coupa competes against SAP's Ariba unit, Nvoicepay, and AvidXchange.

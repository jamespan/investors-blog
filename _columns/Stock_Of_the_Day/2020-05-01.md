**Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as Wall Street calls for the diabetes treatment player to outmaneuver the coronavirus pandemic.




The viral outbreak weighs on some medical technology outlets as doctor appointments and elective procedures are delayed. But Insulet makes insulin pumps for diabetes treatments. Its business benefits from recurring revenue, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a report to clients.


Marcus doesn't expect Insulet to be immune from the effects of the pandemic. But he does expect the company to be better insulated than a major portion of [medical technology companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/).


"While Insulet will no doubt experience Covid-19 headwinds along with the rest of medtech in the coming months, the recurring revenue nature of the business and the life-or-death nature of diabetes treatment makes the company relatively well positioned over the coming months," he said.

Insulin Pumps In Diabetes Treatment
-----------------------------------


Insulet sells insulin pumps for diabetes treatment. These body-worn devices deliver insulin to patients whose bodies don't produce enough — or any — insulin. Insulin is necessary to control glucose, a type of blood sugar. Spikes in glucose are dangerous without insulin to control them.


The first and second quarters loom as potential soft spots for Insulet and other diabetes treatment companies, Canaccord Genuity analyst Kyle Rose said in his recent note to clients.


In a survey of endocrinologists, half said they began feeling the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the second week of March. However, more than a quarter, 27%, indicated they didn't feel the impact — such as canceled appointments — until the third week of March.


"We expect the first-quarter reporting season to be relatively OK, in line to slightly softer than expected, but expect the brunt of the impact to come in the second quarter," he said. "We expect the primary point of weakness to come from softer new patient additions."


Many patients who don't use an insulin pump rely on multiple daily injections of insulin. This market represents the biggest growth opportunity for Insulet and other diabetes treatment companies. But the pandemic is likely to slow the number of new patient additions this year, Rose said.


However, existing customers are likely secure. In fact, Insulet recently [announced a financial program](https://investor.insulet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/insulet-expands-its-us-financial-assistance-program-current) to help patients who've lost their jobs or health insurance due to the viral outbreak. The program provides up to six months of Insulet's products for free.


Rose has a hold rating on PODD stock.


Insulet Expected To Be Profitable In 2020
-----------------------------------------


Insulet is scheduled to report its [first-quarter earnings](https://investor.insulet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/insulet-announce-first-quarter-2020-financial-results-may-7-2020) next Thursday. Then, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect the diabetes treatment company to report a loss of 2 cents per share and $189 million in sales. Sales would pop more than 18%.


Like others, Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang assumes the pandemic tamps down on the conversion of new patients to Insulet's device, known as Omnipod.


"The pandemic aside, we continue to hold favorable expectations of Omnipod adoption in the U.S. and Europe, increased profitability fueled by Insulet's direct distribution of Omnipod in Europe and the introduction of a second line at the highly automated U.S. manufacturing facility," she said in a report.



She expects Insulet to gain significant operating leverage over 2020-25 and has optimistic gross margin projections over the long term. Wang kept her 126 price target on PODD stock.


Despite analysts' expectation for a 2-cent loss in the first quarter, Wall Street expects Insulet to be profitable for the remainder of the year. For 2020, analysts call for Insulet to earn 44 cents a share, minus some items. Analysts see that more than doubling to $1.29 a share in 2021.


Meanwhile, sales are on a similar trajectory. Analysts call for annual sales to top $1 billion in 2022.


PODD Stock Has High Ratings
---------------------------


This comes after major competitor [**Johnson & Johnson**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/) ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) exited the diabetes treatment arena in 2018, and after **Roche** ([RHHBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHHBY)) exited the U.S. insulin pump market in 2017. Now, Insulet's major competitors are **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) and **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)).


Wang says Insulet sales can top $2.4 billion by 2027. That won't be enough to unseat Medtronic, which makes a combination device using an insulin pump and a glucose monitor.


"There may be upside to our base case if Insulet becomes a serious competitor or a target for acquisition," she said. "The longer it takes rivals to develop competitive products, the stronger Insulet will grow in the meantime."


PODD stock gets high grades from Investor's Business Daily. Insulet stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. This puts PODD in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.


Representatives of Insulet declined to comment.

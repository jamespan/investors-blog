The [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) is **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)), as the maker of enterprise software for customer support and sales automation outperforms the overall market. Zendesk stock has pulled back after hitting an all-time high earlier this month.




Zendesk stock retreated to its [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) last week after notching a record high of 86.85 on April 3. The move marks the stock's first pullback to the key support level since it broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 72.86 on Feb. 6.


Zendesk stock rose 2.1% to close at 82.58 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The San Francisco-based company plans to report [first-quarter results](https://investor.zendesk.com/ir-home/financial-reports/financial-releases/financial-releases-details/2019/Zendesk-Announces-Date-of-First-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results/default.aspx) after the market close on April 30. Wall Street expects Zendesk to earn an adjusted 3 cents a share on sales of $179.5 million. In the year-earlier period, it earned 2 cents a share on sales of $129.8 million.

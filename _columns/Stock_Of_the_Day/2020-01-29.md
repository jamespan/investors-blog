"We see minimal risk vs. fourth-quarter expectations across the group, and the long-term outlook remains compelling with key catalysts in 2020," he said. He lowered his price target on TNDM stock to 70 from 75 to reflect more competition in the latter half of 2020.


Shares of TNDM Stock Break Out
------------------------------


The massive jump for TNDM stock on Wednesday follows the diabetes treatment outlet's launch of new software called Control-IQ. The new technology is paired with Tandem's t:slim X2 insulin pump.


Tandem's body-worn insulin pump, Dexcom's G6 continuous glucose monitor and the Control-IQ software integrate to create a [closed-loop system](http://investor.tandemdiabetes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tandem-diabetes-care-announces-commercial-launch-tslim-x2-0) to help diabetics maintain normal levels of a blood sugar called glucose.


In some diabetes cases, patients' bodies don't produce insulin, a key hormone that helps manage glucose. Spikes in glucose can be dangerous without insulin. So, the new system automatically adjusts the amount of insulin a patient receives to control those spikes.


Tandem launched the new system in mid-January. Patients will need a new prescription and to undergo online training, Piper Sandler analyst Matt O'Brien said in his note to clients. But the new system will be available to current patients for free via remote download.


"The company started processing new orders earlier this month, and will monitor these new customers as they proceed through the insurance process before setting guidance for the year," he said. O'Brien has an overweight rating and 70 price target on TNDM stock.


Diabetes Treatment Space Heats Up
---------------------------------


SVB Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy expects Tandem to swipe share from competitors in the diabetes treatment space, as well as gain new users from the large pools of patients still giving themselves multiple insulin shots each day.


She estimates just 35% of patients with Type 1 diabetes — those who don't make their own insulin — have converted to insulin pumps in the U.S. Meanwhile, the Type 2 population — those who can worsen to the point they need insulin help — is vastly underpenetrated.


"As one of two players aggressively converting MDI (multiple daily injections) patients, Tandem is contributing to this market growth, while also in a position to capture replacement market share," she said in a note. The other key player is Insulet.


Meanwhile, Control-IQ will gain steam in the U.S. as it cannibalizes sales of Basal-IQ, an older software system that also pairs with the t:slim X2 insulin pump. Notably, the Basal-IQ system is still launching in international markets.


Antalffy says the Street doesn't totally appreciate Tandem's revenue growth potential. In 2020, analysts broadly expect the diabetes treatment company to generate 22% growth in sales. But she expects Tandem to guide to 25%-30% sales growth for 2020.



"With a high conviction in sales upside to the consensus, we expect Tandem to deliver 'beat and raise' quarters throughout 2020," Antalffy said. She reiterated her 72 price target and outperform rating on TNDM stock.


Representatives of Tandem declined to comment for this story.


Tandem Could Become Profitable
------------------------------


Tandem is set to [report its fourth-quarter](http://investor.tandemdiabetes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tandem-diabetes-care-announce-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019) results on Feb. 24.


Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect the diabetes treatment company to report adjusted losses of 8 cents per share on $109 million in sales.


But the company could turn profitable later this year. In the second and third quarters of 2020, the Street expects Tandem to earn 4 cents and 5 cents per share, respectively. That could turn into annual profits in 2020 and 2021.


That could also help improve the [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) for TNDM stock, which stands at 61 out of a total 99. The score puts Tandem's recent profitability in the top 39% of all stocks.


Shares of TNDM stock have a more bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 87. The RS Rating is a measure of a stock's 12-month performance. Leading stocks tend to have RS Ratings of 80 or above.


The diabetes treatment company also has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 80 out of a best-possible 99. The CR pits a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks. So, TNDM stock ranks in the top 20% of all stocks.

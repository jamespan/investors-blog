**TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). TopBuild stock is holding in a buy zone following strong earnings from the insulation producer and installer. Building-related stocks are benefiting from plunging interest rates and are relatively insulated from the escalating China trade war.




Last Thursday, the building materials supplier reported a 39% jump in earnings to $1.43 a share, easily beating analyst estimates for $1.28. But TopBuild earnings growth has slowed for four straight quarters. Sales rose 9% to $660.1 million, with gains decelerating for a third quarter.


Still, the results were strong enough to drive TopBuild stock powerfully above a long [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) buy point of 87.06.


TopBuild stock fell 1.8% to 87.85 heading into the close on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), after slightly undercutting the entry intraday.


Keep in mind that with the stock market under pressure and continuing to sell off, investors should be extremely cautious about making any purchases.



TopBuild Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


The 14-month base for TopBuild stock was 53% deep. Breakouts from bases that are at least 40% deep are less likely to succeed. However, the handle was well over two months long, more than sufficient to be considered its own, separate [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for TopBuild stock is at a 52-week high, almost exceeding its June 2018 record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Even with TopBuild stock falling Monday, its RS line climbed.



Other Builder Stocks
--------------------


TopBuild is ranked No.1 in IBD's Building-Construction Products group, which is No. 36 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Other top stocks in the group include **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) and **Armstrong World Industries** ([AWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AWI)). Builders FirstSource stock edged up Monday after spiking 12% to a 52-week high on earnings. Armstrong World Industries stock fell 1.2% after reversing sharply lower last week following earnings.


Among homebuilders, industry giant **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) soared on earnings last week and tried to break out, but couldn't close above the 47.12 flat-base entry. D.R. Horton stock retreated 2.7% to 45.75 on Monday.


TopBuild Earnings Record Strong
-------------------------------


TopBuild stock has a 97 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99 and a 99 EPS Rating, according to [IBD's Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-topbuild-corp-bld.aspx).


Over the last three years, TopBuild earnings have risen an average of 43%, a strong pace. On the revenue side, TopBuild's three-year growth rate is 16%.


Investors generally should look for stocks with sustained earnings and sales growth of at least 25%.


Building Stocks: Shelter In A Trump Tariff Storm
------------------------------------------------


TopBuild and other builder-related stocks are benefiting from plunging interest rates. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 at the end of July. Treasury yields have plunged as an escalating China trade war raises concerns about the global economy.


But that means lower mortgage rates for homebuyers or for businesses to finance new office space.


Meanwhile, builder stocks aren't very exposed to China as President Donald Trump threatens to impose more [tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/what-is-a-tariff/) on China over currency manipulation, sparking continued fears of a spiraling trade war.


Still many stocks that appear to have little China exposure are still coming under press. This is not a good time to buy stocks as U.S. indexes extend their losing streak. But investors should be making a watchlist to act on when the market rebounds.

**Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the streaming video platform hit a formal buy point ahead of its second-quarter earnings report. Roku stock surged Friday in heavy volume.




The San Jose, Calif.-based company plans to release its June-quarter results on Aug. 4. Analysts expect Roku to earn 12 cents a share on sales of $618.8 million, according to FactSet. In the year-earlier period, Roku lost 35 cents a share on sales of $356.1 million.


Last week, Roku said it received [double the spending commitments from advertisers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roku-stock-streaming-video-platform-boasts-advertiser-gains/) during this year's upfront ad sales compared with last year's season. Advertisers were particularly interested in buying commercials around Roku Originals, including shows that Roku acquired from Quibi.


Roku gets most of its revenue from selling advertising on its platform, including its own Roku Channel. It also sells streaming devices and provides an operating system for smart televisions.

Roku Stock Surges On Friday
---------------------------


In afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Roku stock jumped 10.7% to 465.67. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-trading-know-these-3-basics-about-a-stocks-trading-volume/) was well above average. In intraday trading, it climbed as high as 466.64.


Roku stock reached a conventional [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 463.09 out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. An alternative interpretation sees the base as a double bottom with a handle, although it doesn't change the buy point.


However, aggressive investors could have picked up shares on Thursday when Roku stock broke above a short downtrend near 425.


Needham analyst Laura Martin recently reiterated her buy rating on Roku stock with a price target of 550.


"Roku is a pure-play way to invest in growth of the U.S. over-the-top and connected-TV ecosystems," she said in a note to clients. "Roku is a walled garden, so it has best-in-class data about its viewers."


Hoping For Olympic Boost
------------------------


Roku is hoping to get an increase in viewers from the Tokyo Summer Olympics, which run starting Friday through Aug. 8.


On Tuesday, it announced a partnership with **Comcast**'s ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) NBCUniversal to bring an [immersive Olympic experience](https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/07/nbcuniversal-and-roku-partner-to-bring-all-new-immersive-/7h2snhcx-1626756048) to streamers on the Roku Platform. Roku has updated its home screen to promote the games.


Roku said it will offer easy access to NBCUniversal's 5,500 hours of streaming coverage of the Summer Games directly from its home screen. Also, Roku users will be able to access coverage of the games via the NBC Sports and Peacock channels.


Investor's Business Daily added Roku stock to its [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlists on Friday. Roku stock also is on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Roku stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 88 out of 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-roku-inc-cl-a-roku.aspx). IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

**United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Monday. UAL stock cruised briefly into a buy zone as airlines stocks in general make their way back from the coronavirus pandemic travel dearth. The Chicago-based airline was added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) list of top growth stocks on Monday at a [one-half position size](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/portfolio-management-can-be-effective-with-pyramiding/).




United Airlines stock is on the mend as the company returned to profitability during its second quarter, buoyed by recovering travel demand. United posted earnings of $1.43 per share in Q2 and $2.81 in the third quarter this year. That's compared to losses of $3.91 per share and $1.02 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2021.


For the fourth quarter, United expects adjusted earnings to range from $2 to $2.25 per share after it posted a loss of $1.60 in Q4 last year. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts forecast earnings of $2.07 for the period.


In September, United said it continued to see "strong demand" vs. pre-pandemic levels. And the recovery could really take off next year. Analysts expect full-year earnings to fly to $6.11 per share for 2023, up from a forecast of $2.14 for this year, and much improved from the loss of $13.94 per share reported for 2021.


On Monday, Morgan Stanley upgraded United Airlines stock to overweight, from equal weight. It tagged the stock with a price target of 67, almost 50% above where shares traded on Monday.


Last week, Helaine Becker at Cowen cited United as her top pick among airlines, partly due to its exposure to higher-margin international travel.


On Friday, rumblings surfaced that [United Airlines is close to a deal](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-takes-off-on-united-airlines-deal-buzz/) with **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) as United prepares to order around 100 planes to replace its aging widebody jets and fleet of Boeing 767s.


United Airlines Stock Analysis
------------------------------


IBD ranks United Airlines second in the Transportation-Airline Group, trailing only **Copa Holdings** ([CPA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPA)) according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). UAL stock briefly eclipsed the 45.67 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) for its six-month [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) base but retreated just below the entry.


The handle is showing firm support at the stock's [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). And shares are holding above the other key technical lines.



The latest base formed in a deep consolidation, which began in March 2021. That pullback started within an even longer-term consolidation triggered by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in January 2020.


UAL stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending higher again. And shares have an 89 RS Rating out of a possible 99, indicating strong performance against its peers in the stock market. United Airlines has a 79 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines a number of technical indicators into one score. And its recovering earnings earned United a 78 [EPS Rating.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/)


United Airlines stock rose 2.6% to 45.03 by Monday's closing bell. UAL stock is up nearly 26% over the past three months but has gained only about 1.4% so far this year, and remains far below its record high set in 2018.

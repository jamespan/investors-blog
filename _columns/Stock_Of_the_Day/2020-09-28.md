In breaking up a monopoly, **Axonics Modulation Technologies** ([AXNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXNX)) made life easier for tens of thousands of patients â€” while building a $100 million run rate in a matter of months. AXNX stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




Quick acceptance of Axonics' implantable devices designed to eliminate incontinence already gives the company at least 20% and perhaps more than 40% of its market, according to analysts. This for a product that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration just approved last October.


The quick gains also prompted response from the only other company that offers a similar device. And that rival is the world's largest medical device company, **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)).


Not to worry, say analysts, because this is a market that is only going to grow.

"The long-term clinical value that Axonics offers, paired with steady cadence of continued innovation, has helped to solidify its position in this market," Truist Securities analyst Kaila Krum wrote in a recent note to clients. She said this is so despite "concerns around competition."


AXNX Stock Gets Strong Ratings
------------------------------


Krum, who estimates Axonics' market share at 20% or more, rates AXNX stock a buy, with a price target of 50.


Needham analyst Mike Matson, in his report to clients last month after the company's earnings release, judges the market share at about 43%, up from 25% in the first quarter. He bases that on comments from Axonics executives.


Matson, too, rates AXNX stock a buy, with a price target of 57.


The Irvine, Calif.-based company specializes in treating urinary and bowel dysfunction via implantable sacral neuromodulation, or SNM, devices. Implanted just beneath the skin in a minimally invasive surgery, the devices improve the miscommunication between the bladder and the brain, via the sacral nerve, that causes an overactive bladder or urinary incontinence.


Medtronic had been the company to make SNM devices since getting FDA approval in 1997. But unlike Axonics, Medtronic's devices weren't rechargeable. They lasted less than five years on average. So, patients would need to go through the surgery at least that often.


Also, its devices generally weren't compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. So, again, new surgery was required if a patient needed to undergo an MRI procedure.


Axonics First With Rechargeable SNM Devices
-------------------------------------------


Axonics developed SNM devices that were MRI compatible and rechargeable, claiming they last 15 years on average. The recharging is done for an hour each month. Patients wear a belt with a hockey puck-sized device on the back that recharges the SNM.


Medtronic has responded with rechargeable and MRI-compatible devices, but Axonics still has momentum. From near zero, Axonics posted first-quarter sales of $26.3 million, a $100 million-plus run rate just five months after FDA approval. The impact from Covid-19 cut second-quarter sales to $15.2 million. Still, analysts polled by FactSet expect 2020 revenue of $90 million and 2021 sales of $150 million.


Axonics representatives declined to comment for this story, saying they are in their earnings quiet period. Analysts forecast third-quarter sales of $22.4 million. The company, though, is expected to continue to lose money through at least 2021.


The company says 87 million adults in the U.S. and Europe suffer from overactive bladders, and an additional 40 million suffer from accidental bowel leakage. This issue mostly affects females. Generally, those who suffer from these issues will first be told to try diet and exercise.


Rising Market, Market Share Boost AXNX Stock
--------------------------------------------


If those measures fail, doctors prescribe drugs that might, or might not, help. Japan's Astella Pharma is the biggest maker of such drugs. Tiny **Urovant Sciences** ([UROV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UROV)), also based in Irvine, is developing a drug to treat these conditions that could get FDA approval as soon as December.


In any case, the sacral neuromodulation device market is only expected to grow as more adults seek relief. Analysts estimate the annual SNM global market, which is mostly in the U.S., at $650 million. Axonics has said it expects the market to double in three to five years, expanding from about 40,000 procedures per year to 80,000.


Those projections would give Axonics lots of room for growth even with a competitor the size of Medtronic. In his August report, Needham's Matson said he expects "strong revenue growth and upside to consensus through both market share gains."


AXNX stock peaked at 46.15 on Aug. 7. It's consolidating with a buy point of 46.25. Though it was up for much of Thursday's session on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AXNX stock ultimately dipped 0.9% to close at 43.89.


In another bullish sign, the relative strength line for AXNX stock is hitting new highs. AXNX stock carried a Composite Rating of 84, putting it in the top 16% of all stocks.

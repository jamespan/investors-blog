**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it gets set to top its all-time high after forming a bullish base.

The stock is closing in on a buy point from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), one of the most successful of all chart patterns. It has formed a second-stage base with a correct entry of 295.34. The fact that trading has been light during the handle stage is another bullish sign.


Domino's shares closed up 1.45% at 291.54 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). It has been a good year so far for the stock, as it is currently up around 54%. In addition, it has jumped by about 1,000% since breaking out from a similar cup base in 2011.


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is trending up, while it is well clear of its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), a key level of technical support.


The firm has impressive fundamentals, which is represented by its excellent, but not quite ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 94. In addition, the stock has an eye-catching [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 97, which puts it in the top 3% of stocks in this important metric, which tracks earnings-per-share growth.


Domino's share price is recovering [after sliding on a revenue and same-store-sales miss](https://www.investors.com/news/dominos-pizza-earnings-second-quarter-papa-johns-wendys-merger/). It fell despite earnings topping estimates last month.


Restaurant analyst Mark Kalinowski, of Kalinowski Equity Research, previously attributed Domino's revenue gains to several factors.


These include technological advantages over other pizza companies, as more customers order online and via their smartphones. He also cited a value deal the chain has had in place for nearly 10 years: two medium pizzas with two toppings for $5.99 apiece.

Domino's Pizza Cooks Papa John's
--------------------------------


Domino's is also benefiting from the problems swamping rival chain **Papa John's** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)).


Last month, the firm accepted founder John Schnatter's resignation as chairman of the board after it was reported he had used a racial slur during a conference call in May. Schnatter apologized afterward.


In contrast, Domino's has enjoyed an orderly transition to the leadership of new CEO Ritchard Allison, who took the reins in July. The former president of Domino's International took over from J. Patrick Doyle, who had led the firm for eight years.


While Domino's Pizza stock has made great gains, Papa John's has tumbled 23% so far this year.

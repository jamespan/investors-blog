Home-cleaning robot leader **iRobot** ([IRBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRBT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Roomba maker approached a buy point ahead of its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday. IRobot stock rose in anticipation of positive news but dropped on disappointing sales.




IRobot stock was just below a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 132.98 in an eight-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/). It climbed 2.1%, near 131.40, in afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) , then fell on its earnings report, losing more than 14% after the close.


The Bedford, Mass.-based company reported March-quarter results after the market close. Investors are cautioned against [buying a stock right before quarterly earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/should-you-buy-stock-ahead-of-earnings/).


If the [stock would have gapped out of the base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) Wednesday morning, even if it's beyond the [conventional 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/), it could still be worth buying. Breakaway gaps can lead to even greater gains. Typically you would place your stop loss below the low of the breakaway day. But the stock's plunge late Tuesday is likely to preempt any thoughts of a breakout any time soon.



IRobot stock formed a flat base after breaking out of a 23-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at a buy point of 118.85 on Feb. 15. But that cup was a little too deep at nearly 39%, when the ideal depth is 15% to 30%. It hit an all-time high of 132.88 on March 5 before [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) again. The subsequent shallow flat base was a good sign.


IRobot Stock Owned By Top Growth Funds
--------------------------------------


Another good sign is ownership of iRobot stock by leading growth funds such as Primecap Odyssey and Columbia Acorn.


IRobot earned 78 cents a share on sales of $237.7 million in the March quarter. Wall Street expected iRobot earnings of 68 cents a share on sales of $252 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. On a year-over-year basis, iRobot earnings per share rose 18% while sales climbed 9%.


Best known for its automated Roomba vacuum cleaner, iRobot also makes a robot floor mopper and robot pool cleaner. Plus, it has announced a robotic lawn mower.

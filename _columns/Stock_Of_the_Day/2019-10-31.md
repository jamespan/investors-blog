**Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after beating earnings estimates, upping guidance, and giving investors a massive dividend increase. The stock rose toward a buy zone on Thursday.




The provider of payment processing services to merchants in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific said third-quarter earnings per share jumped 15% to $1.70, clearing views for $1.66 per share. A 28% revenue surge to $1.31 billion bested expectations for $1.16 billion.


The firm now sees EPS for 2019 coming in at $6.12-$6.20, up from $6.00-$6.15. The new midpoint is higher than the average analyst estimate of $6.13. Its dividend is also to increase to 19.5 cents per share from just 1 cent per share.


CEO Jeff Sloan touted his firm's $21.5 billion deal to acquire Total System Services earlier this year, as well as new team-ups that should lead to more growth.


"We are further advancing our technology-enabled strategies and solidifying our leadership position in payments globally," he said in a press release.

Total System Services Payoff
----------------------------


Management now expects to realize annual run-rate revenue synergies of at least $125 million and annual run-rate expense synergies of at least $325 million within three years. This is higher than its prior view of $100 million and $300 million, respectively.


Piper Jaffray senior analyst Jason Deleeuw believes the guidance given on Total System Services will turn out to be conservative over the longer term.


"GPN already raised its cost and revenue synergy guidance, and we believe it is likely GPN will exceed those new, higher targets over the next three years," he said in an Oct. 31 research note, rating the stock at overweight with a 198 target. "We believe the combined GPN-TSYS business is a stable, scaled business model insulated through macro cycles and leading secular technological change."


With consolidation occurring in the space, and the retail environment still strong, the analyst expects growth will continue to accrue.


Global Payments also announced today a deal to snap up Canadian firm Desjardins's merchant acquiring business and portfolio of around 40,000 merchants. Financial terms were not disclosed, but it is projected to close by early 2020.


Under the deal it will enter into an exclusive 10-year marketing alliance that will see Desjardins refer members to Global Payments for payment processing technology.


It comes after **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) announced earlier this week it will incorporate Global Payments' card processing solutions into its forthcoming consumer payments offering for institutional clients.

Focus On Small, Midsize Businesses
----------------------------------


Global Payments offers e-commerce, omnichannel and cross-border payment processing products. A specific strength highlighted by analysts is its integrated point-of-sale products for small and midsize businesses.


The firm's OpenEdge platform allows merchants to accept card, electronic, check and digital-based payments and uses software to simplify the tracking process. It includes security features such as end-to-end encryption and tokenization.


Global Payments' strong offerings and early mover advantage have helped it vacuum up small to medium size businesses. Other big beasts in the integrated processing space include Worldpay, which itself has been acquired by Fidelity National Information Services.

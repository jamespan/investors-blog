CLOSE




Wayfair stock jumped 4.3% to close at 306.74 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It's finding support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The company also turned its first profit [in the second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wayfair-earnings-q2-2020-wayfair-stock/). Revenue jumped 84% from the year-ago period to $4.3 billion.


Covid Tailwinds Boost Sales
---------------------------


"It was a very strong second quarter for Wayfair as Covid demand tailwinds benefited our sales momentum," Chief Executive Niraj Shah said in a conference call with analysts.


Active customers reached 26 million, a jump of 46% from the year-ago period. More than 60% of orders were placed via a mobile device, up 53%.


"Just to put things into perspective," Shah said, "we activated nearly five million net new customers, more than the last four quarters combined. In the U.S., we also re-engaged more than 1 million past customers who have been absent from the platform for longer than 12 months."


Wayfair reports third-quarter results on Nov. 3. Wall Street expects revenue of $3.65 billion, up 58%, with adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share.


Bottlenecks Could Pressure Wayfair Stock
----------------------------------------


Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, in a report to clients Tuesday, cautioned that "logistic bottlenecks" likely will limit upside potential on revenue.


"Importantly, data points suggest overall e-commerce and the home furnishings category transactions finished the third quarter on a strong note following a bit of a lull in late August/early September," Sebastian wrote.


He has a neutral rating on Wayfair stock and a price target of 315.


In the second quarter, repeat orders more than doubled year over year. Yet new customer orders grew even faster.


Customer Satisfaction With Wayfair
----------------------------------


"This is the first quarter that this dynamic has played out since Wayfair's IPO in 2014," Shah said. "The behavior of these customers activated during the Covid era continues to suggest that they are a high-quality set who will choose Wayfair again and again."


At the same time, Shah cautioned, "There's a tremendous amount of macro uncertainty and various pressures on the consumer. That said, what we have seen thus far would suggest that even as economies reopen, our customers remain focused on the home and are extremely satisfied with Wayfair."

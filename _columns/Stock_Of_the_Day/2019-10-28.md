**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it surged Monday on news that the software giant had won a hotly contested U.S. Defense Department cloud-computing contract. Microsoft stock jumped to a record high.




Late Friday, the Defense Department announced that Microsoft beat out presumed favorite **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in the battle for the Pentagon's cloud-computing contract known as JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure. The 10-year deal is worth as much as $10 billion, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-wins-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract-beating-amazon/). The JEDI initiative is intended to modernize the Pentagon's technology.


Microsoft stock jumped 2.5% to close at 144.19 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Earlier in the trading session, it notched an all-time high of 145.67. Microsoft stock broke out of a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 142.47, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


Amazon stock rose 0.7%, near 1,773.75, in afternoon trading.

Microsoft Is World's Second-Most-Valuable Company
-------------------------------------------------


Microsoft stock ranks No. 25 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks. It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89 out of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-corp-msft.aspx). That means it has outperformed 89% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.


Microsoft is the top stock in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group. But that group has fallen out of favor and now ranks No. 159 out of 197 industry groups. Three months ago, it ranked No. 35.


Microsoft's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is hitting new highs in a positive sign for the stock. It has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 86. That means it has outpaced 86% of stocks on the market over the past 12 months.


The Redmond, Wash.-based software leader has a market value of nearly $1.11 trillion. It is the second-most-valuable company, behind **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which has a market capitalization of $1.12 trillion.


JEDI Contract A 'Game Changer' For Microsoft
--------------------------------------------



Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives called the JEDI contract win a "game changer" for Microsoft. The deal "will have a ripple effect for the company's cloud business for years to come," Ives said.


Microsoft's Azure unit, Amazon Web Services and others will compete for $1 trillion in cloud-computing spending over the next decade, he estimated in a note to clients.


Amazon Likely To Protest Microsoft's Victory
--------------------------------------------


Analysts expect Amazon to challenge the JEDI contract decision. It is likely to cite political interference by the White House due to President Donald Trump's dislike for Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos.


"The next phase of this saga could be an Amazon protest or even a lawsuit after the company is debriefed by the Pentagon on the rationale for its loss," Cowen analyst Nick Yako said in his report to clients. "The animus between President Trump and Amazon (Chief Executive) Jeff Bezos raises the level of intrigue."


The complexity involved in the JEDI contract and other migrations to the cloud from on-premise hardware should be a boon for defense information-technology contractors, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma said in his report.


He predicted that consulting firm **Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)) would be one of the largest third-party beneficiaries of the JEDI contract.


Microsoft Climbs Following Quarterly Earnings Beat
--------------------------------------------------


Last Wednesday, [Microsoft reported better-than-expected results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-earnings-q1-2020-msft-stock/) for the September quarter thanks to strong commercial cloud sales.


Microsoft earned $1.38 a share, up 21% year over year, on sales of $33.06 billion, up 14%, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts expected Microsoft earnings of $1.25 a share on sales of $32.23 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.


However, for the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $35.55 billion, vs. Wall Street's expectations for $35.91 billion.

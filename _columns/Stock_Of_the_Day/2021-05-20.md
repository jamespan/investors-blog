**Concentrix** ([CNXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNXC)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the call-center operator, spun off in late 2020 by **Synnex** ([SNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNX)), nears an entry point based on its 21-day exponential moving average.




Concentrix stock popped in early 2021 after it reported results for the November quarter. In February, Concentrix [formed a flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) with an entry point of 123.58.


Concentrix stock took off again after it reported first-quarter earnings on March 24. Shares in Concentrix hit an all-time high of 163.28 on April 26.


Now, the company's stock has pulled back to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). From a technical view, there's also the tighter [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) at work. Concentrix stock could be actionable if it gets above its 21-day line.


Shares added 1.1% to close at 149.79 Thursday.


Concentrix Stock: Double-Digit Gains In Results
-----------------------------------------------


For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Concentrix said revenue rose nearly 14% to $1.35 billion while adjusted earnings rose 70% to $1.72 per share.


Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as EBITDA, came in at $212.6 million, or 15.7% of revenue, compared with 14.8% of revenue in the year-earlier period.


Concentrix stock holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 79 out of a best possible 99.


The call center services business had been consolidating. Concentrix's former parent, Synnex, agreed to buy Cincinnati-based Convergys for $2.4 billion in mid-2018. Then, more companies outsourced call center operations that handle customer support last year amid the coronavirus pandemic.


Synnex decided to spin off Concentrix on Dec. 1. Synnex retained a computer and electronics distribution business.


Rivals Include Alorica, Teleperformance
---------------------------------------


Concentrix competes in the call-center business versus Alorica, Teleperformance and others. The company describes itself as a "global provider of customer experience solutions and technology."


In a streamlining move, Fremont, Calif.-based Concentrix on May 17 sold off its insurance services arm to private equity firm Abry Partners and Hoplon Capital.


In addition, Concentrix holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-plantronics-inc-plt.aspx).


The A/D rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


The Computer Software-Enterprise group that includes Concentrix ranks a weak No. 166 out of 197 groups tracked.

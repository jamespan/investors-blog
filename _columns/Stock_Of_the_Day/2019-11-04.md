**Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as robust third-quarter deliveries drive a higher profit outlook from the iconic sports-car maker. Ferrari stock hit a buy zone in Monday's stock market, though it closed below the entry point. Former parent **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) extended its recent run, while luxury electric-vehicle maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) moved toward its first buy point of 2019.




Ferrari earnings rose 11% to $1 per share in the third quarter. Revenue increased 4% to $1.02 billion. Analysts had expected Ferrari earnings per share of 93 cents on sales of $998 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.


Ferrari, spun out of Fiat Chrysler in 2015, raised its full-year profit outlook, citing a 9% jump in Q3 deliveries [powered by the Ferrari Portofino and the 812 Superfast](https://corporate.ferrari.com/sites/ferrari15ipo/files/2019_11_04_-_ferrari_q3_2019_results_press_release.pdf).


Ferrari now expects 2019 EPS of 3.70-3.75 euros, up from 3.50-3.70 earlier. It also raised its 2019 revenue outlook to 3.7 billion euros, up from 3.5 billion previously. It expects industrial free cash flow to be higher than its prior view as well. But Ferrari earnings and revenue guidance reportedly was just short of analyst targets.

Ferrari Stock Clears A Buy Point
--------------------------------


Shares of Ferrari gapped 5.3% to 169.99 in Monday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). Ferrari stock rose as high as 172.89 intraday, topping a 170.64 flat-base [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy trading volume.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Ferrari stock is near its best level in more than three years, though it is not quite above the consolidation's high. The RS line tracks a stock's performance against the S&P 500. It's the blue line in the chart provided.


However, the base, stretching back to mid July, has formed largely below the 50-day moving average. Moreover, there are few signs of institutional buying in the base.



Fiat Chrysler, Tesla Stock Rally
--------------------------------


Fiat Chrysler stock added 2.9% Monday. Italian-American [Fiat Chrylser and Peugeot owner PSA Group](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/fiat-chrysler-stock-jumps-peugeot-merger-talks-resume/) of France agreed to merge last week, sending Fiat Chrysler stock soaring 20%. Shares are at their best levels since July 2018.


Tesla stock rallied 1.3% to 317.47. Shares pulled back nearly 5% last week, in part due to federal safety regulators probing possible battery defects that may have caused its electric cars to burst into flames. But that follows a Tesla stock surge of 28% in the week ended Oct. 25 due to surprise third-quarter earnings. Tesla stock now has a 340.94 handle buy point in a consolidation going back to December 2018.


**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) advanced 1.1% after a UAW strike ended over a week ago. **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) gained 1.2%. Last week Ford reached a deal with the United Auto Workers, avoiding its own strike.


Ferrari Eyes Luxury Expansion
-----------------------------


Also on its earnings call Monday, Ferrari revealed more about its brand diversification strategy. The Italian luxury-car maker will tap another Italian icon, Giorgio Armani, to move its handbag and clothing accessories further upmarket.


"Our current offerings are too stretched and are in danger of diluting our very precious brand equity," CEO Louis Camilleri told analysts, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-04/ferrari-poised-to-unveil-plan-for-expansion-in-luxury-products). Within the next seven to 10 years, Ferrari sees its branded luxury goods contributing 10% of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) .


Former Chairman Sergio Marchionne, who died in 2018, championed the idea of transforming Ferrari into a fully fledged luxury brand.


Ferrari Stock Is No. 1 In Auto Group
------------------------------------


Ferrari stock has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. That means it is in the top 4% of all stocks based on key fundamental and technical metrics.


It's the No. 1 stock in the auto manufacturers industry group, ahead of Fiat Chrysler, **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), Tesla stock and GM stock, the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-saia-inc-saia.aspx) shows.


An RS Rating of 88 is among the highest in its group. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C indicates buying and selling have been roughly equal in the past 13 weeks.


Ferrari Earnings Growth
-----------------------


An EPS Rating of 90 is solid. But Ferrari earnings growth has averaged 10% in the past three quarters vs. 29% over the past three years.


[CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) recommend investing in stocks with both quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%.


Before the Q3 results, analysts expected Ferrari earnings per share to climb 3% to $4.08 in all of 2019 and a further 11% in 2020.


Ferrari stock has gained 45% in the past year. Tesla stock is down 7%, even with the recent surge.


Why is Ferrari stock outperforming its peers? It comes down to earnings growth. Though Ferrari earnings growth has cooled, it's good enough, especially as U.S. and global auto sales sputter.


Ferrari also looks robust on other fundamental metrics. Its 23% pretax margin and 61% return on equity are practically unmatched in its group.

Dexcom stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after shares broke out and rocketed to a record high on the diabetes treatment outlet's massive earnings beat.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), shares of **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) soared 27.2% to close at 194.70, in [heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/). Dexcom stock surged past a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 178.55 out of a [first-stage consolidation](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/base--op-and-base-patterns-cma--base--building-cma--price-consolidation-area-cma--price-pattern-cp-) that began in late August.


Since the stock staged a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/), buying shares near the Thursday session open price at 185.20 is also justified. Listen to [Thursday's IBD Live session](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) for more detail on this [alternate buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/).


Canaccord Genuity analyst Kyle Rose said Dexcom had an "exceptional quarter," featuring the diabetes treatment company's best U.S. growth rate since early 2016. Dexcom sells continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, for patients with diabetes. Its newest CGM is called G6.


"Looking forward, Dexcom continues to drive patient awareness of the G6 and we expect robust new patient additions to persist into 2020," he said in a report.

Dexcom Stock Breaks Out In High Volume
--------------------------------------


In diabetes, patients' bodies don't properly manage insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar known as glucose. Spikes in glucose can be dangerous, especially for patients with diabetes. Dexcom's continuous glucose monitors are body-worn medical devices that track glucose.

During the [third quarter, Dexcom](https://dexcom.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dexcom-reports-third-quarter-2019-financial-results) generated $396.3 million in sales. That crushed the average forecast of analysts polled by FactSet for $347.9 million. On a year-over-year basis, Dexcom's sales grew 49%. U.S. revenue increased 53% while international sales jumped 36%.


Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share advanced 261% year over year, more than triple analyst estimates for 20 cents per share, according to FactSet. Canaccord's Rose noted Dexcom is on track for its first year of as-reported and adjusted profitability.


The diabetes treatment giant also raised its outlook for the year. Dexcom expects sales to grow 38%-41% year over year to $1.425 billion to $1.45 billion. That's an increase of $87.5 million, at the midpoint of Dexcom's guidance. The outlook also topped forecasts for $1.37 billion in sales.


Diabetes Treatment Landscape Is Changing
----------------------------------------


Diabetes treatment is rapidly changing due to the advent of continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. Many patients are now receiving their medical devices through pharmacies. This is easier for all stakeholders, Canaccord's Rose said.



"It's clear that the efforts to lower barriers to adoption and shift patients to the pharmacy channel have been extremely successful with explosive growth in demand for the G6 system from both patients and clinicians," he said.


Notably, Dexcom stock isn't alone here. On Wednesday, shares of **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) ramped up 10.5% after the diabetes treatment player also [handily beat third-quarter estimates](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/insulet-stock-rockets-diabetes-treatment-player-crushes-quarterly-forecasts/). Insulet makes insulin pumps and is also enjoying the shift to pharmacy sales of its products.


For Dexcom, the struggle will be keeping up with demand, Rose said.


"We continue to expect the company to invest heavily to meet increased demand and, to that end, the company is on track to double capacity by year-end 2019 with plans to double capacity again by mid-2020," he said.


Dexcom Continues To Rival Abbott Labs
-------------------------------------


Dexcom confirmed a limited launch of its next-generation continuous glucose monitor, dubbed G7, in late 2020, UBS analyst Matthew Taylor said in a note to clients. It will fully launch the G7 in 2021.


Meanwhile, the Street is waiting for **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) to gain Food and Drug Administration clearance of its next-generation glucose monitor. Medtech companies Abbott and Dexcom rival one another in diabetes treatment.


The potential launch of Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 — likely in the first half of 2020 — is weighing on Dexcom stock, Canaccord's Rose said. Bearish investors worry competitive pressure will hurt Dexcom's pricing and margins.


"Regardless, we continue to believe the market is large enough to support multiple players and Dexcom's manufacturing focus and product pipeline position the company with a strong lineup of fully equipped, lower-cost technologies," he said.

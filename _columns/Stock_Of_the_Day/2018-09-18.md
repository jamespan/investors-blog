The IBD Stock of the Day is **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)), which unveiled its most powerful sports car ever for the general public — the Ferrari Monza — and laid out plans to vastly expand and electrify its lineup.







The luxury car brand also trimmed its guidance for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to 1.8 billion to 2.0 billion euros — roughly $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion — by 2022. That's modestly below an earlier goal of 2 billion euros, when the late Sergio Marchionne was CEO.


At an event Tuesday in Italy, the company showed off the special-edition Ferrari Monza. The open-topped sports car comes in one- and two-seat versions. It can reach more than 60 mph in less than three seconds. Pricing was unavailable, though limited-edition supercars often sell for upward of $1 million.


Bloomberg described the Ferrari Monza as "the closest thing to a Formula 1 racer ever built for the public market." CNBC said the carbon-fiber car lacks a roof or windscreen, with a "virtual wind shield" pushing air flow above the driver in the cockpit.

Ferrari Stock Hits Buy Signal
-----------------------------


Shares of Ferrari popped 4.2% to close at 138.32 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), breaking out of a consolidation that formed around their 50-day average.


The stock, which had also been getting support at its 200-day line, is on track for its fifth up week in the last six weeks, with the lone down week coming in low volume.


The moves point to a short-term buy signal, and the stock was just added to [Swing Trader](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader_Optimizely&src=AURLJHH).


Ferrari is also forming a conventional base with an entry of 149.95. However, the big question mark is whether the relative strength line can get back to its prior high.


Meanwhile, **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) rose 0.9%, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) fell 3.4% on reports its under criminal investigation, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) added 0.2% and **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) edged up 0.3%.


Ferrari Special Editions, First SUV
-----------------------------------


As luxury-auto makers roll out SUVs, new Ferrari chief Louis Camilleri announced its first-ever entry in the segment. The Purosangue, meaning thoroughbred, will hit the market by 2022.


Marchionne, whose sudden death in July shocked the markets, had targeted a 2020 debut for the SUV. Including the utility vehicle, Ferrari plans 15 new models, including hybrid cars and more limited editions, as it looks to diversify its lineup and double core earnings by 2022.


Ferrari will add electric power to more than half its lineup. Camilleri called his new five-year strategy plan "ambitious, but doable," according to reports.


The price/product mix of the upcoming product lineup would drive ["significant increase in average retail price"](http://corporate.ferrari.com/sites/ferrari15ipo/files/2._ferrari_cmd_sept_2018_-_e._galliera.pdf) and [growth in profitability](http://corporate.ferrari.com/sites/ferrari15ipo/files/4._ferrari_cmd_sept_2018_-_a._picca_piccon.pdf), Ferrari said.


Ferrari shares dived in August after Camilleri called his predecessor's targets "aspirational" and saw "risks" on the horizon.


Marchionne spun Ferrari out of Fiat Chrysler, which he also led nearly up to his death.


Enviable 30% margins have aided Ferrari's 28% stock surge year to date. But some investors fret that moves to diversify Ferrari's lineup could hurt the brand's exclusivity.

**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as holiday bargain hunters flocked to the discount retailer of teen fashions and accessories. Five Below stock cleared a buy point Tuesday.




The Philadelphia-based retailer reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings on Dec. 2, with same-store sales growth more than double expectations. EPS surged 88% to 32 cents, vs. views of 20 cents. Meanwhile, revenue jumped 26% to $476 million. Analysts had expected $444.9 million. Same-store sales rose 12.8% vs. analyst views of 5.3%.


Retailers such as Five Below, unlike many essential discounters like [**Target**](https://www.investors.com/research/target-stock-buy-now/) ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and [**Walmart**](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-good-buy/) ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) that also sell groceries, had to weather store closures for months earlier in the year due to Covid.


In March, Five Below shut down all of its 950 stores in 38 states. In May, the retailer of teen-oriented merchandise priced generally at $5 and below reopened 75% of its stores, but foot traffic remained sluggish for several months as restrictions limited the number of shoppers allowed inside at one time.


But Five Below and others kicked off the holiday shopping season early, offering promotions in October. As a result, store visits at Five Below improved, rising 10% in October compared to the year-ago period.


President and CEO Joel Anderson said the focus for the fourth quarter would be on expanding checkout capabilities and offering same-day delivery for about 300 stores.

Five Below's Competitive Advantage
----------------------------------


Analysts say Five Below serves a niche in the value-oriented teen and tween demographic. The retailer is quick to pick up on trends, says CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky.


"Our research has found that FIVE has a price advantage over peers, due to low-cost operating structure and merchandising strategy to take advantage of closeout channels, which gives it significant purchasing power," she wrote in a note to clients.


Yanushevsky says the company competes with a broad range of retailers including discount, mass merchandise and grocery stores with both an online and physical presence. She says the company's teen and preteen focus differentiates it from **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)).

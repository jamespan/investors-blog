**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the athleisure brand looked to bounce off its 50-day moving average and gain ground for January, after giving bullish fourth-quarter guidance earlier this month. LULU stock edged down a fraction Tuesday.




Lululemon is a yoga-inspired, technical athletic apparel maker and retailer with men's and women's clothing that it calls athleisure wear. Chip Wilson founded the company in the late 1990s, with a single store in 2000.


In July 2007, LULU stock went public with an initial public offering of 18.2 million shares at $18, raising $327.6 million. On July 30, the first day Lululemon traded on the New York Stock Exchange, shares closed at 29.98. The company executed one two-for-one stock split in 2011.


Lululemon currently competes with sports sector titans **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Adidas** ([ADDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDY)), **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) and others.


On Jan. 8, Lululemon announced it expects Q4 revenue to be in the range of $3.170 billion-$3.190 billion, up from the previous guidance range of $3.135 billion-$3.170 billion.


LULU also forecast diluted earnings per share to be $4.96-$5.00 per share in Q4. The company's prior expectation was EPS of $4.85-$4.93.

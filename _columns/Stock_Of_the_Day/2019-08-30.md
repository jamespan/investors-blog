**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), a supplier of technology and materials for OLED displays and lighting, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it posts big sales and earnings gains. OLED stock is trading just below its recent record high.




Universal Display stock broke out of a second-stage [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 190.10 on [June 18](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/universal-display-stock-breaks-out-cup-handle-base/). It peaked at 218.28 on Aug. 2 after delivering better-than-expected quarterly results, but fell as the market went into correction. It has found support at its [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), it dipped 0.7%, to close at 205.47.


Like a number of top stocks, OLED stock will have formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) on a weekly chart after Friday's close. Its new buy point is 218.38.


Universal Display's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is near its recent highs, a bullish sign. The relative strength line maps a stock's performance against the S&P 500 index.

Key Player In Burgeoning OLED Market
------------------------------------


The Ewing, N.J.-based company is a key player in organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, technology. Its OLED products are used in smartphones, wearables and televisions as well as lighting products.


OLED displays have better color reproduction and use less power than traditional liquid crystal displays, or LCDs. Key customers include display makers Samsung and **LG Display** ([LPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPL)).


Because OLED displays are flexible, the company foresees a growing market for folding and curved displays. Samsung and Huawei are among several handset makers planning to sell [folding-screen smartphones](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/samsung-other-smartphone-makers-gamble-on-folding-screens/) later this year.


Consecutive Quarters Of Triple-Digit Earnings Growth
----------------------------------------------------



On Aug. 1, Universal Display crushed Wall Street's targets for the [second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/universal-display-earnings-q2-2019-oled-stock/) and raised its sales forecast for the full year.


Universal Display earned 92 cents a share on sales of $118.2 million in the June quarter. Analysts expected earnings per share of 46 cents on sales of $77 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.


On a year-over-year basis, Universal Display earnings jumped 300% while sales rose 110%. It was the second quarter in a row of triple-digit gains in sales and earnings.


For the full year, Universal Display guided to sales of $380 million, based on the midpoint of its outlook. That's up from its earlier forecast of $355 million. Last year, it recorded sales of $248 million.


OLED Stock Makes IBD's Flagship Watch List
------------------------------------------


Universal Display ranks No. 3 on the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top-performing growth stocks.


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-universal-display-corp-oled.aspx) gives Universal Display stock a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, meaning it has outperformed 96% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.


The company ranks first in IBD's Electronics-Miscellaneous Products group, which ranks No. 85 out of 197 groups.

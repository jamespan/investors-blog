**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chip foundry is holding strong amid the recent sell-off in technology stocks. TSM stock is forming a flat base.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), TSM stock rose 2.7% to 79.43.


TSM stock has been moving sideways while other top chip stocks, such as **AMD** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), have tumbled. In fact, TSM stock is on pace to form a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 84.10 by the end of the week.


[Taiwan Semiconductor](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/tsm-stock-record-heights-q2-earnings/) has been leading the race to make chips at ever-smaller sizes. Its advanced manufacturing processes have boosted the fortunes of fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD and Nvidia as well as top customer **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

Taiwan Semi Aims To Maintain Its Lead
-------------------------------------


Taiwan Semiconductor is mass producing chips at a scale of 5 nanometers. In comparison, rival **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC))Â is making chips at 10 nanometers. Circuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter. Smaller circuits translate to faster, more power-efficient processors.


Taiwan Semi hopes to stay ahead of other chip foundries in advanced process nodes. It is now developing chips at a scale of 3 nanometers. It plans to start producing 3-nanometer chips in low volumes next year, with sizable production set for the second half of 2022.


Taiwan Semi competes for business with other foundries including Samsung and GlobalFoundries. Foundries are contract manufacturers for semiconductor companies that don't own their own fabrication plants, known as fabs. By contrast, Intel designs and produces its own chips.


Pull-In Business Before Huawei Ban?
-----------------------------------


On July 16, Taiwan Semiconductor beat Wall Street's targets for the [second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/taiwan-semiconductor-q2-2020-tsm-stock/) and guided higher for the current quarter. It earned 78 cents per U.S. share, up 90% year over year, on sales of $10.38 billion, up 34%, in the June quarter. The company credited strong sales of 5G wireless and data center chips for its outperformance.


For the September quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor guided to sales of $11.35 billion. Wall Street was modeling $10.71 billion.


However, some Wall Street analysts are concerned that Taiwan Semiconductor will be negatively impacted by the U.S. Commerce Department ban on doing business with Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei.


Taiwan Semi likely has profited from a pull-in of business from Huawei and its suppliers ahead of a Sept. 15 deadline, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a recent note. He is negative on TSM stock.


"As the Sept. 15 Commerce Department deadline requiring all Huawei suppliers to obtain a license looms, our recent checks suggest continued pull-in of wafer shipments, particularly from smartphone customers," Hosseini said in an Aug. 24 report on TSM stock.


TSM Stock Ranks First In Chipmaker Group
----------------------------------------


On July 6, TSM stock broke out of a 25-week [consolidation period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) at a buy point of 60.74, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Taiwan Semiconductor ranks first out of 30 semiconductor stocks in IBD's chip manufacturing industry group, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-taiwan-semiconductor-adr-tsm.aspx). It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of 99. The Composite Rating scores a stock's key growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group.


TSM stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 93% of stocks over the past 12 months.

**Copart Earnings, Outlook**
----------------------------


The Dallas-based company has posted four straight quarters of accelerating earnings. In May, Copart reports third-quarter EPS of $1.09, 88% above the year-ago period. Sales jumped 33% to $734 million. U.S. unit sales climbed 4.5% for the quarter, while international unit sales declined 5%.


However, Copart's unit volume surged 30% year over year. And CEO Jeffrey Liaw said this is a reflection of "a strong used-vehicle price environment," among other factors. And worldwide average selling prices grew 48% year-over-year for the quarter.


He says the pandemic has boosted ASP recently. But going back before that, "it has been demand from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles" that has pushed up prices.


Nevertheless, Liaw acknowledges this is an "unusual historic moment for used-car valuations, given the supply shortage for new cars." Still, he maintains that selling prices will prove durable over time.


As the vaccine rollout continues and folks head back to normal life, driving activity is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. For now, though, CEO Liaw says commuting traffic is still down 25%-30% or more based on sources like Google Maps.


"Longer term, we continue to expect modest increases in per capita driving," he said. "As we've observed over the past 50 years, mobility remains essential for employment, education, health care, leisure and every other aspect of our existence."


While Liaw anticipates some increase in virtual-work arrangements, he thinks they'll be offset by a shift from various forms of other mass transits in favor of driving.

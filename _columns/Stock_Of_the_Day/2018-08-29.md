Shares within the industry group have climbed a collective 46% year to date. Apptio stock has done better than that, rocketing 59% over the past eight months. The group is led by **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) in terms of market cap, and [includes newcomer](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Docusign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)).


Apptio Stock's High Relative Strength
-------------------------------------


Apptio stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/) of 94 out of a best-possible 99. That puts it in the top 34 stocks in its group with RS Ratings above 90. Apptio's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) is slightly lower at 78 out of a total 99.


But Apptio could be ready to take off. Shares have formed several short-lived bases this year, making for a stair-stepping effect into the newest base.


Its recent [second-quarter earnings](https://www.apptio.com/press-release/apptio-announces-results-second-quarter-2018) were particularly strong. For the first time ever, Apptio reported a profit, bringing in adjusted income of 1 cent per share. That compares with a loss of 8 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.


Biggest Sales Increase
----------------------


Sales grew 31% to $59 million. That was the biggest year-over-year increase in sales in 14 quarters. Subscription sales increased 32% to $49.2 million as service revenue generated $9.8 million, rising 23%.


Chief Executive Sunny Gupta credited momentum in the firm's IT Financial Management Foundation application, solid renewals and up-sells, and strength in the public sector for Apptio's solid quarterly growth.


"The growth of cloud spending, the complexity of hybrid IT (information technology) and the shift toward digital and agile are all serving as market tailwinds for Apptio," Gupta said recently in a prepared statement.

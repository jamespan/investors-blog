**CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)) is Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the pandemic's self-storage boom shows surprising staying power. CUBE, a REIT stock, rose toward two [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) as investors accumulate this defensive group enjoying a rare growth spurt.




REIT Stock Momentum
-------------------


CUBE stock is among a group of five big self-storage REIT stocks that have been big winners this year. Four of these five REITs (or real estate investment trusts), with CUBE being the exception, have enjoyed recent breakouts. CUBE stock could be poised to follow.


Higher rents and high occupancy contributed to 15.6% growth in same-store revenue for CubeSmart in Q3. Funds from operations surged 27% in Q3. That compares with more typical FFO growth of 3% for all of 2019.


Wall Street analysts have "underestimated the strength and the quality of the demand of the customer that has come to us here since the beginning of the pandemic," CubeSmart CFO Timothy Martin said on the Nov. 5 Q3 earnings call. "We've all been too conservative in our expectation as to how sticky that customer is and how robust demand is."


A combination of factors appears to be driving demand. Pandemic disruptions, such as college students moving back home, have certainly played a role. The work-from-home trend created more sustainable growth via decluttering. Rising real estate prices have families settling for less on-site storage space and more off-site.

CUBE Stock
----------


On Monday, CUBE stock rose 0.1% to 54.40. CUBE is just below a 55.17 entry point from a seven-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). That entry is 10 cents above the Sept. 8 high.


While CUBE stock crested that buy point multiple times in November, the recent tight trading just below that buy point makes for a nice potential setup.


A weekly [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool) chart also shows a 56.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a five-week flat base, 10 cents above the Nov. 3 high.


CUBE stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the charts provided that tracks the stock's performance against the S&P 500, is just below a multiyear peak notched in early September.



The RS line for self-storage REIT stocks has been trending higher since mid-November, with the group providing defensive protection as investors worry over faster Fed tightening and the omicron variant. High dividends of REIT stocks are looking more attractive as prospects for faster Fed tightening and a potential omicron pandemic wave have pushed down the 10-year Treasury yield.


Among the other self-storage REIT stocks, **Life Storage** ([LSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSI)) is just below a 140.05 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) buy point. **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)) has climbed slightly out of buy range. **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) is still within buy range from a 327.14 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) buy point. **National Storage** ([NSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSA)) is about 2% below a 65.08 flat-base buy point.


CUBE Stock News
---------------


On Nov. 2, CubeSmart hiked its quarterly dividend 26.5% to 43 cents per share.


On Nov. 15, CubeSmart announced the $1.6-billion acquisition of Storage West. Shortly after, CubeSmart floated $1.05 billion in debt and sold 15.5 million shares to fund the acquisition.


REIT stocks don't pay corporate taxes and don't retain much cash for doing deals. To bypass the corporate income tax, REITs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders as dividends. Those aren't "qualified dividends," which are taxed as capital income, but are instead taxed as regular income. That matters if the stocks aren't held in a tax-advantaged retirement account.

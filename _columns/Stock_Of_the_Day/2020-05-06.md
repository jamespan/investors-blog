**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the Latin America e-commerce leader vaulted to a record high Wednesday on a strong quarterly earnings report.




Argentina-based MercadoLibre is one of the largest providers of e-commerce services in Latin America, operating in 18 countries. The company's largest markets are Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and it also has a presence in Colombia, Costa Rica and Ecuador, among other countries.


The company reported first-quarter results after the market close Tuesday that smashed revenue estimates. In addition, revenue of $652 million beat analyst estimates of $635 million. Revenue climbed 38% from the year-ago period, but 70% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis.


It reported an adjusted loss of 44 cents per share vs. estimates of a 39-cent loss. But that was secondary in the sense that other key items in the report excited Wall Street equity analysts.

CLOSE




MercadoLibre stock jumped 19.6% to close at 742.88 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). In earlier trading, the stock hit a record high of 777.97, up 25%.


MercadoLibre Stock And Buy Points
---------------------------------


The stock burst out of a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a traditional buy point of 633.30. But it quickly extended beyond the buy range of up to 664.96. In effect, it was also a [breakaway earnings gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). In this case, the proper buy point would be around 751, based on the price in the first several minutes of trading.


A breakaway gap is the [quintessential breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and a crucial part of stock analysis. As a result, by the close of trading on a gap-up day, it's not unusual to see a leadership-quality stock rise at least 20%. Volume tends to surge well above average, as did MercadoLibre, suggesting the stock is going higher.


Also significant, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) shot to a record high. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.


MercadoLibre provides an online marketplace for buyers and sellers and hosts platforms where users can create online stores. MercadoLibre also handles shipping, money transfers, lending and online payments, as part of its financial technology businesses. Other revenue streams include advertising and classifieds.


Although the use of e-commerce in Latin America is relatively low compared with more developed regions, it's growing fast, providing a big market opportunity for MercadoLibre.


Less Affected By Coronavirus Than Others
----------------------------------------


Despite the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the company maintained a positive outlook.


"Starting in March, toward the back end of a successful first quarter, we began to observe near term headwinds generated by the coronavirus outbreak," Chief Financial Officer Pedro Arnt said in an earnings call with analysts. "Although less affected than others, our business did register this impact."


He added, "To summarize, we had a strong start to the first quarter that got derailed during the back half of March and rebounded in April. Given the recent trends we remain optimistic that, despite everything else that has been occurring, we will still be able to make progress toward our annual objectives, without having to delay or materially modify our investments or strategic initiatives."


PayPal Invested $750 Million In MercadoLibre
--------------------------------------------


In March 2019, **PayPal** made a [$750 million investment in MercadoLibre](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-paypal-stake-mercadolibre-stock/). It was part of a secondary offering that raised $2 billion. PayPal stock climbed 2.5%, near 128.40 Wednesday.


The proceeds were used for the expansion of MercadoLibre's various e-commerce platforms, to strengthen its logistics infrastructure, and to solidify its position as a provider of end-to-end financial technology and payments solutions.


The financial technology unit of MercadoLibre is called Mercado Pago. It faces competition in digital payments from Brazil-based **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)).


Total payment volume in the quarter through Mercado Pago reached $8.1 billion, up 43.5% and 82% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 102%, totaling 290.7 million transactions, the [MercadoLibre earnings report](http://investor.mercadolibre.com/static-files/502aff41-fc86-4c47-b393-68d965d2682c) said.


Record Gross Merchandise Volume
-------------------------------


Gross merchandise volume reached $3.4 billion, up 10.6%, and 34% on an exchange-neutral basis. Items sold reached 105.7 million, growing 27.6%.


"This represents the highest rate of GMV growth since 2016, and is attributable to an acceleration in the broader shift from offline to online," Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a report to clients.


"We believe this shift toward e-commerce, particularly in nascent categories like grocery and consumer packaged goods, will benefit MELI's top-line even after the pandemic ends as more consumers get used to purchasing online," he added.


Colantuoni boosted his price target on MercadoLibre stock to 800, from 510, with a rating of hold.


Double-Digit Growth In Users
----------------------------


The company said mobile gross merchandise volume grew 198% on an exchange-neutral basis, reaching 70% of GMV.


Unique active users grew 31% to 43.2 million.


Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju raised his price target to 770, from 720, with a rating of outperform.


"There are additional signs that MercadoLibre is emerging as an increasingly attractive distribution outlet as it continues to scale its managed fulfillment network, which in turn should drive better selection, increased consumer value proposition, and ultimately faster transaction velocity," Ju wrote in his note to clients.

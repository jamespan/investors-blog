**CVR Refining** ([CVRR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVRR)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the oil refinery stock getting a bullish bounce after a quarterly earnings beat.

The stock has been finding [support at the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/) as it builds the base. The fact that the entire base formation is above the 50-day line is especially bullish.

Stock Of The Day Earnings Beat
------------------------------


CVR earnings late Wednesday beat expectations with EPS of 80 cents topping views for 75 cents. And revenue growth accelerated considerably on a sequential basis, up 36% to $1.824 billion vs. a 2% rise in the March quarter.


[CVR contributed the quarter's success](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/25/1542251/0/en/CVR-Refining-Reports-2018-Second-Quarter-Results-And-Announces-Cash-Distribution-of-66-Cents.html) to the widening spread in crude oil prices.


CVR Earnings Track Record Weak
------------------------------


But a spotty track record of earnings has in large part contributed to a weak [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 67 out of 99 for this stock of the day. Strong stocks typically have high Composite Ratings as they launch big runs. In addition to earnings and sales growth, the CR also factors in profit margins, return on equity and price performance, among other metrics.

Elsewhere among [energy stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/royal-dutch-shell-stock-buyback-conocophillips-earnings/) in the refining space, **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) is retaking its 50-day line in heavy volume. Marathon Petroleum stock shot up 7.3% to 80.16 Thursday. Marathon Petroleum earnings and revenue growth accelerated from the prior quarter, the company reported Thursday. Marathon stock is now trading 4% below an 83.43 buy point.

Meanwhile, Dow Jones oil majors **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) are working on bases, but have notably weak [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500.

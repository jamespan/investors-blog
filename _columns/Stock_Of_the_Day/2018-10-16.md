**Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) is the IBD Stock of the Day, which is acting well in a tough market and currently resides in a buy zone.







Match was added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) list of top-performing companies on Monday, as the stock rallied sharply above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


The stock previously triggered a sell signal but recovered quickly. The rebound started with a positive price reversal last week, moving above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-weak-rebound-action-after-violating-the-50-day-line/). It continues to move higher.


The Dallas-based company markets online-dating services, including Tinder, as well as test prep and college counseling across the globe. Match also owns the dating services of OKCupid and PlentyOfFish. Match calls itself the world's leading dating services provider, with more than 45 brands. Match offers dating services in 38 languages across more than 190 countries.

Nomura analyst Mark Kelley last week initiated coverage on Match Group with a buy rating and a price target of 66. That's a 17% premium from where the Match stock currently trades.


Match Stock Buy Range
---------------------


Shares of Match surged 6.1% to close at 57.15 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The buy range is from 53.95 to 56.65.


"We believe that Match will remain the clear leader in dating for the foreseeable future, as Tinder growth continues, other brands continue to evolve," Kelley wrote in a note to clients. "We are not concerned about Facebook's recent entry into dating, nor do we view the dating landscape as a winner-takes-all market."


Match is holding a decent profit cushion after breaking out of a [large cup-style base](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/top-growth-stocks-wall-street-sell-off/) at 48.75 on Aug. 10. Match stock is up 83% this year. The company was spun out of **IAC/InterActive** ([IAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAC)) with an [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/square-match-rise-after-ipos/) in November that priced shares at 12.


Match stock [dove in May](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-dating-app-announcement-sends-down-match-group-iac/) when **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) said it would leverage its social media platform for online dating services. Facebook is still testing its online dating service.


Dating-Market Opportunity
-------------------------


Kelley estimates the total market opportunity for dating-focused apps and websites will reach $12 billion by 2020, excluding China. He thinks Match will collect 20% of that market by 2020.


Match stock soared 17% after the company reported [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-stock-alibaba-earnings-reported/) on Aug. 7 that topped expectations. Adjusted earnings were 41 cents a share, up 156% from the year-ago period and the second quarter in a row of triple-digit gains. Revenue rose 36% to $421.2 million, maintaining a long string of double-digit gains.


Tinder continues to drive Match Group's revenue growth. Tinder had 3.8 million paid subscribers as of June 30, up 81% year over year. In 2017, revenue grew 19% to $1.33 billion, posting the biggest annual top-line growth in at least five years.

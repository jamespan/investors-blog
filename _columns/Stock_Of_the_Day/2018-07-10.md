**Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), but the oil stock has been whipsawed since Monday's breakout.




The [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) tumbled intraday to 32.61 soon after the open in Tuesday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) on a late Monday announcement to sell 10 million shares in a follow-on offering. The stock rebounded from its 50-day moving average, briefly turning positive before tumbling 5.3% to 33.71 at the close.


Houston-based Cactus stock broke out Monday from a short [cup-with handle base](https://shop.investors.com/images/promotional/pdf/IBD-CHARTPATTERNS.pdf?src=JA3813&intcode=HPSpot) with a 35.29 buy point, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/).


Cactus, which designs, manufactures, sells oil wellheads and pressure control equipment, went public in February at 19 a share. Cactus stock hit an all-time high of 37.50 on May 22.



The stock boasts solid fundamentals, which is reflected in its good, but not ideal, [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 82. Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is a far more impressive 96 out of a best-possible 99.

Contributing to Cactus stock's run, and Tuesday's volatility, are crude oil prices. **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)), **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) are [top oil stocks hitting buy points Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-stocks-exxon-mobil-marathon-oil-conoco-phillips-hit-buy-points/) as continued supply concerns support crude prices. But all four pulled back from buy zones as U.S. crude futures pared gains to close up 0.4% at $74.11 a barrel.


Cactus Stock Offering
---------------------


Late Monday Cactus said it would sell 10 million class A shares, but on its own behalf and not existing shareholders. The company will use the proceeds to buy shares in Cactus LLC, the actual operating subsidiary.


Cactus products are sold and rented principally for onshore unconventional oil and gas wells.

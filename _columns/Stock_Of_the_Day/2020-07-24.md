Zillow Group is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the online real estate portal benefits from technology investments while the Covid-19 coronavirus reshapes the industry. Zillow stock has consolidated, forging a new entry point amid a rising relative strength line.




The residential real estate market has proved resilient amid the coronavirus lockdown and a deteriorating economy. Some urban dwellers are moving to suburban or rural areas, seeking less dense environments, said Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley in a report.


Other consumers are shopping for new homes as remote work becomes a permanent option.


Even so, analysts say that Zillow's outlook is tied to how deep and long a U.S. recession will be. Zillow's economic team has told analysts it expects the housing market to bottom in the June quarter, but the Covid-19 outbreak could force some states to shut down a second time.

Zillow Stock Forges New Entry Point
-----------------------------------


After a March sell-off, Zillow stock technically has [formed a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), with a buy point of 65.85. Shares were just above that at 66.04, up 0.8%, in afternoon action on the stock market today.


Zillow stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 94 out of a possible 99. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has improved, a bullish signal.


Seattle-based **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)), while unprofitable, has posted three quarters of triple-digit sales growth, due mostly to its homebuying operation gains and the acquisition of a mortgage company in 2018. It reports quarterly earnings on Aug. 6.


Investors may want to be cautious. As of June, some 16% of shares were short, noted Walmsley. One trading strategy for investors heading into company earnings reports is using [call options](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/stock-market-strategies-using-options-around-earnings-helps-minimize-risk/).


The reopening of Zillow's iBuyer markets should be a plus for the company, says Wedbush Securites analyst Ygal Arounian.


"iBuying, is when these real estate companies are taking principal interest and buying homes from home sellers, fixing them up slightly, and then reselling them," Arounian told IBD in an email.


"It's kind of like flipping a home, but not really," he said. "The idea isn't to buy distressed homes and do a full renovation, but it's more of a service to home sellers, to make the transaction easier. Home seller sells to Zillow at a slight discount, Zillow fixes it up and puts it back on the market."


Zillow Offers For Online Buyers
-------------------------------


The iBuyer program also is called "Zillow Offers." That business is growing quickly and accounted for much of the company's massive sales gains. But margins in that business are structurally lower, thus leaving the company at a deficit, profit-wise.


RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney says Zillow has more markets open than rival **Redfin** ([RDFN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDFN)). Zillow has reactivated 20 out of its 24 markets, he says.


Another boost could come from real estate agents that advertise on Zillow's website. They're called "premier agents" by Wall Street analysts that follow the company. Zillow has offered discounts to spur premier agent advertising, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said in a report to clients.


Webush's Arounian sees more consumers shopping for homes digitally before committing to in-person meetings.


"Zillow comes out better positioned to take advantage of an industry readier for tech disruption," he said. "Its investments in 3D mapping technology, rich media, virtual tours, and digital transactions gives its portal even more relevance."


Zillow Technology Investments: Virtual Tours, 3D Shopping
---------------------------------------------------------


In her note to clients, Canaccord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps said Zillow launched appointment-based virtual tours leveraging its "3D Home" technology amid the Covid-19 lockdown. The company uses artificial-intelligence software to price homes faster and more accurately, she said.


JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey adds that Zillow has allocated more sales leads generated at the website to its most productive agents, thereby improving customer satisfaction and gaining market share.


Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic will spur "longtime transformational change in the industry," D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White said in a note.


"Zillow Group may very well emerge as a stronger, more resilient and more diversified business than it was going in," White said. "The virus will likely accelerate the timetables in ways that should benefit ZG. For example, increased digitization of part or all of the real estate transaction (online notarizations/financings) should benefit ZG in areas such as its Mortgage offering and the 'iBuying' business."

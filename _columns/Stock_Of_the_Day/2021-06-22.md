**Upwork** ([UPWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPWK)), the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), has benefited from the change in work habits due to the pandemic. Upwork stock on Tuesday broke out in heavy volume and moved into buy range.




The company provides an online platform that connects freelancers with businesses, where they can collaborate remotely. Its platform is used by one-person startups, large companies and everything in between.


"The pandemic has changed work forever, permanently shattering the biggest impediment to online freelancer adoption, which is prior discomfort with remote work," Chief Executive Hayden Brown said in comments made during its quarterly earnings conference call last month.


"Regardless of their comfort levels before the pandemic, companies now know they can build and grow their businesses faster, and with greater efficiency by incorporating remote talent," Brown added.

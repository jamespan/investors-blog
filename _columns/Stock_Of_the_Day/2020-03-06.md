**1Life Healthcare** ([ONEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONEM)), the parent of primary care clinic operator One Medical, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) One Medical got a shot in the arm on Super Tuesday. The revival of Joe Biden's Democratic nomination prospects and fading hopes of Bernie Sanders and his Medicare-for-All dream are a big deal for the San Francisco-based company, which just had its IPO on Jan. 31.




In its IPO registration statement, One Medical warned that revenue could suffer under government-run health care. "If our volume of members with private health insurance coverage declines, including due to a decline in the prevalence of employer-sponsored health care, our revenue may be reduced."


That's at least in part because commercial insurance generally pays higher reimbursement rates for services than Medicare. One Medical's subscription model also would be challenged by Bernie Sanders' vision of Medicare for All, with no deductibles or out-of-pocket payments.


The company issues Q4 results, its first quarterly report as a public company, on March 18 after the market closes.


One Medical Stock
-----------------


One Medical stock retreated 1.5% to 23.60 on Friday, amid broad stock market weakness. But that came after One Medical stock jumped 6.9% on the day after Super Tuesday, then followed that up with an 11.6% rally on Thursday.


One Medical's big rally was somewhat overlooked as managed-care players rallied on relief that Bernie Sanders probably wouldn't be the nominee. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)) and others scored double-digit gains on Wednesday.


As the stock market closed on Super Tuesday, before the votes were counted, One Medical closed at its lowest level as a public company.


One Medical stock closed at 22.07 on its initial day of trading, up 58% from the 14 IPO price. The company raised $245 million in the offering. The stock hit an intraday peak of 28.58 on Feb. 10. The current [buy point](//www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 10 cents higher at 28.68.


For now, One Medical is a stock to keep on your watchlist. Initial [breakouts for IPOs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) can produce rich gains.


One Medical is not in a buy zone and the current stock market correction makes it a risky time for new buys. Be sure to read IBD's [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column each day to find out when the red light turns green. After Wednesday's big rally, The Big Picture explained why it didn't qualify as a follow-through day starting a new uptrend.

One Medical Business Model
--------------------------


One Medical, founded in 2007, had 397,000 members and 77 medical offices in nine U.S. markets as of Sept. 30. New members pay a $199 annual fee, while enterprises typically pay a discounted annual fee for their employees. Those subscription revenues accounted for 48% of revenue in the first three quarters. The rest comes mainly from fee-for-service payments.


One Medical has yet to turn a profit. It lost $34.2 million in the first three quarters of 2019, up from $26.9 million in the year-earlier period. Over the same period, revenue grew 29% to $198.9 million. Google accounted for more than 10% of revenue.


Piper Sandler analyst Sean Wieland gave One Medical an overweight rating and 29 price target on Feb. 25. He called it the leader in "Primary Care V2.0," saying it can grow revenue 25% as it disrupts a $100-billion market.


One Medical says that its business model delivers a payoff for enterprise customers. "With real-time video and phone consults available typically within minutes, and same and next day in-office appointments, we have demonstrated a 41% reduction in emergency room visits and total employer cost savings of 8% or more."


Wall Street's excitement about telehealth has been growing for a while. But it has hit new levels amid the coronavirus outbreak. Pure-play telehealth provider **Teladoc** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) is up close to 20% since the S&P 500 peaked on Feb. 19.

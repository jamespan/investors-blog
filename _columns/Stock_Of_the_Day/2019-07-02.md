On Sept. 28, Amarin expects the Food and Drug Administration [to approve Vascepa](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amarin-stock-flies-fda-grants-priority-review-high-cholesterol-treatment/) as a treatment for high triglycerides in patients who are also taking statins to manage high LDL cholesterol. In these patients, Vascepa would lower the risk of cardiovascular troubles.


"We anticipate Vascepa revenue growth to accelerate further after label expansion approval and with a larger sales team, and then again after we commence promotion of Vascepa for cardiovascular risk reduction on television and through other media," Chief Executive John Thero said in a written statement.


Amarin Stock Rises On Guidance Update
-------------------------------------


During the first half of 2019, Amarin says it achieved record revenue of $170 million to $174 million. An estimated $97 million to $101 million comes from the second quarter, the biotech company said in a news release. The lion's share of these results stem from Vascepa sales.


Second-quarter sales would rise 84% to 92% year over year. Revenue in the first half of 2019 would jump 76% to 80%. As a result, the biotech company raised its full-year outlook — with a caveat.


"The history of other therapies for chronic conditions suggests that growth builds over multiple years, and thus, the company is not prepared to provide quantified guidance regarding revenue levels beyond 2019," Amarin said.



Biotech Company To Double Sales Force
-------------------------------------


Amarin also said it will double its sales force to 800 by October, up from earlier guidance for a sales force of 600-800. This is in timing with the FDA's looming review of Vascepa as a treatment to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with high triglycerides and statin-managed high LDL cholesterol.


The [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) noted at the end of 2018 it hired 265 sales representatives. At the time, Amarin received more than 20,000 applications.


"Based on this track record and the robust results of Vascepa clinical trials, Amarin is confident it can double its sales force to 800 sales representatives by October 2019," the biotech company said.


Amarin Stock Is Climbing
------------------------


Shares of Amarin have a best-possible Investor's Business Daily [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 99. The RS Rating tracks a stock's 12-month performance and then ranks it against all other stocks. So, in terms of performance, Amarin stock ranks in the top 1% of all stocks.


But Amarin stock has a mediocre [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 75 out of a total 99, mainly because of a weak EPS Rating. The 1-99 Composite score measures a stock's key growth metrics, putting shares of Amarin in the top 25% of all stocks.


Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research call for Amarin to lose 6 cents per share this year. But the biotech company is expected to turn profitable in 2020. At that point, analysts expect adjusted earnings of 31 cents a share, growing to $1.05 per share in 2021.


So, Amarin's weak [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) of 22 could improve. The EPS Rating ranks a company's profitability.

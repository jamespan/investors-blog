Zscaler is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm approaches an entry point from an ascending base — a rare chart pattern that can lead to big gains if traded correctly.




Zscaler stock is on the [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist). The San Jose, Calif.-based company is the biggest provider of cloud-based web security gateways. Zscaler's cloud platform enables customers to route data traffic to external data centers where Zscaler houses its software tools.


The cybersecurity firm is getting a boost from the growth of Microsoft Office 365, an online version of **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) productivity software. The cybersecurity tools check data traffic for malware.


Zscaler "has disclosed that 22% of the traffic that is secured through its 100-plus global data centers is attributable to Office 365, which is 10 times the levels from three years ago and represents 25% of the Office 365 base," said UBS analyst Fatima Boolani in a June 19 report.

Boolani added: "This suggests the company is processing web security requests from upwards of 45 million users — based on Microsoft's most recent disclosure of Office 365 Commercial user count of 180 million."


Zscaler Stock: How The Ascending Base Works
-------------------------------------------


Zscaler stock rose 2.1% to 80.64 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). Shares are close to an 82.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). An [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/) chart pattern has three pullbacks, each ranging from 10% to 20%. Each pullback must mark a higher high and a higher low.


Once a strong uptrend takes hold in the broader market, the stock has the potential to break out to new highs.


Zscaler stock has a [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 98 out of a possible 99, meaning it beats 98% of all other issues. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, with a rising RS line pointing to outperformance.


Zscaler: Biggest Provider Of Cloud Web Security Gateways
--------------------------------------------------------


Furthermore, the cybersecurity stock is the biggest provider of cloud-based web security gateways. It's No. 4 overall in the web security gateway market, says research firm IDC.


In addition, the company gets most of its revenue from Zscaler Internet Access. It's a cloud-based replacement for on-premises web security gateways – appliances installed at internal data centers.


Expanding beyond the web security gateway market, the company has rolled out Zscaler Private Access. The new product accounts for about 10% of Zscaler's new customer contracts. Zscaler Private Access targets business workloads deployed at cloud-computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).

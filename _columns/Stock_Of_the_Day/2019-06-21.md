**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the medical devices company flirts with a breakout. Dexcom stock is on its tenth straight day of gains.




Interest is rising in medical devices called [continuous glucose monitors](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/diabetes-treatment-dexcom-stock/), or CGMs, William Blair analyst Margaret Kaczor said in a recent report to clients. Dexcom, **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) and **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) are working in this arena of diabetes treatment.


There was "standing room only" during CGM presentations at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting this month in San Francisco, she said. As a result, Dexcom stock has risen nearly 27% this month, as of Wednesday's close.


"Aside from strong foot traffic, our conversations with clinicians and industry participants also reinforced our thesis that CGM should continue to see strong adoption as the technology becomes standard of care for both type 1 and type 2 intensively managed diabetics," she said.

Using Medical Devices In Diabetes Treatment
-------------------------------------------


In [diabetes treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-device-companies-ignite-revolution-diabetes-treatment/), some patients wear CGMs on their bodies. These [medical devices](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastest-growing-stocks-medical-technology-stocks/) track levels of glucose, a blood sugar, in real time. Doing so allows patients to adjust how much insulin they receive to control that glucose. Spikes in glucose can be especially dangerous for diabetic patients.


Patients often will pair a CGM with an [insulin pump](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/diabetes-treatment-tandem-stock-medical-devices-take-on-medtronic/). These medical devices can automate insulin delivery in response to CGM data. **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)), Medtronic and **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) make insulin pumps, which are also worn on the body.


For years, CGMs have largely been directed to type 1 diabetes patients. These patients depend on insulin due to a genetic condition. But type 2 patients, who develop diabetes over time, can become insulin-dependent, and there's a push for them to also use CGM technology.


"This is a trend that we believe should benefit Dexcom and the marketplace over the next several years, driven by improved access with a move to pharmacy coverage, new device features and ease-of-use characteristics that launch frequently," William Blair's Kaczor said.



CGMs Gain Traction In Diabetes Treatment
----------------------------------------


Diabetes treatment also is moving away from the A1C standard of measuring health, Piper Jaffray analyst J.P. McKim said in his recent note to clients. This test provides a snapshot of glucose in the blood over the past three months.


Now, clinicians are looking to improve the amount of time a patient's glucose isn't too high or too low — also called "time in range." Measuring that requires a CGM medical device.


"CGM is taking over," McKim said. "Physicians want to put as many patients on it as possible, not only (insulin-dependent) type 1's and 2's, but there is even early interest in a diagnostic/education tool for type 2's on oral (medicines) and pre-diabetes."


Medical devices companies are also teaming up to provide better systems of CGMs and pumps. Medtronic has long been a lone wolf in diabetes treatment. But the medical devices giant recently [agreed to a partnership](https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-loop-dexcom-g6-collaboration) with Dexcom and a non-profit entity, Tidepool.


Tidepool is working to create a mobile application that will automate insulin delivery. To do this, it will use insulin pumps from Medtronic and Insulet, paired with a Dexcom CGM. In the future, Abbott's CGM could get clearance for the same use.


"Medtronic's roughly 60% pump market share is a ripe opportunity, given Dexcom's predictive alerts and algorithms," William Blair's Kaczor said.


Dexcom Stock Flirts With Breakout
---------------------------------


Medical devices companies in diabetes treatment are having a heyday. Small players like Dexcom, Insulet and Tandem are all highly rated, according to Investor's Business Daily's standards.


[Dexcom stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-dexcom-stock-diabetes-systems/) has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 95 out of a best-possible 99. The Composite measures a stock's key growth metrics. This puts Dexcom stock in the top 5% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Shares also have a bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 91. The RS Rating is a score of a company's 12-month performance on the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Dexcom stock ranks in the top 9% of all stocks.


Profitability is weaker, with an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) of 66. The 1-99 score ranks the health of a company's recent earnings per share. In the [first quarter ended March 31](https://dexcom.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dexcom-reports-first-quarter-2019-financial-results), Dexcom posted a 5-cent loss. But in 2018, earnings per share were 32 cents.


The medical devices stock briefly topped a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 156.26 out of a [cup](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) in early trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). But by the close, Dexcom stock dipped back below that entry and finished 1.2% at 155.66.


Dexcom stock has been on the rise for 10 straight days, which raises concerns about a pullback. Still, shares could try to surge above that buy point again.

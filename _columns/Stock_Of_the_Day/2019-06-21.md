**Rapid7 Stock Profitability Improving**
----------------------------------------


Rapid7 turned profitable on an adjusted basis in the March quarter. Sales jumped 34% to $73.2 million, marking its best revenue growth in nine quarters. It also marked the biggest revenue total for any quarter in Rapid7's history.


The cybersecurity firm reported a profit of 2 cents per share vs. a loss of 19 cents in the year-earlier period. For the June quarter, analysts estimate a 7-cent loss, narrowing from a 13-cent loss a year earlier.


For fiscal 2019, analysts estimate earnings per share of 5 cents, with adjusted EPS expected to jump to 39 cents in 2020.


Rapid7's inflection to profitability could make it a takeover target, says RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg.


"We believe Rapid7 could be one of the more attractive acquisition candidates in security and could be a nice fit for a larger security or IT infrastructure vendor," Hedberg said in a recent report to clients.


Rapid7 Stock: Robust Relative Strength, Solid RS Line
-----------------------------------------------------


Furthermore, Rapid7 has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.


In addition, the cybersecurity firm's RS line has hit a new high. Relative strength compares a stock's price performance with that of the S&P 500. An [upward-trending relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


"Our belief is that Rapid7 has made investments in anticipation of where the market is headed and is set to reap those rewards," William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in his recent note to clients. "We believe areas like cloud application security and security orchestration are high priorities for organizations."


The IBD Computer-Software Security group is ranked [No. 12 out of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-20-2019/).

**AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the mobile app marketing platform approaches a buy point ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report.


The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company plans to deliver its fourth-quarter earnings results and outlook late on Feb. 12.




Analysts polled by FactSet expect the firm to earn $1.25 a share on sales of $1.26 billion in the December quarter. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 155% in earnings and 32% in revenue.


For the March quarter, Wall Street forecasts AppLovin earnings of $1.30 a share, up 94%, on sales of $1.32 billion, up 24%.


AppLovin's software platform enables app developers to market, monetize and analyze their apps. The company also makes mobile games such as "Wordscapes," "Matchington Mansion" and "Game of War." Plus, the company has expanded into advertising-based e-commerce and streaming television services.


AppLovin's products include AppDiscovery, Max, SparkLabs, ALX, Array, Adjust and Wurl.


On Jan. 25, Jefferies analyst James Heaney reiterated his buy rating on AppLovin stock with a price target of 425.


In a note to clients, Heaney said AppLovin "remains the No. 1 return on ad spend (ROAS) network for the largest spenders." He said AppLovin should benefit from a forecast acceleration of mobile game ad spending growth in 2025.

Ubiquiti stock is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as shares in the maker of wireless networking gear consolidate and possibly forge a new entry point. Demand for internet services in rural U.S. areas and overseas amid coronavirus lockdowns has boosted demand for Ubiquiti gear.




**Ubiquiti** ([UI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UI)) stock popped 8% on its fiscal second-quarter earnings report released on Feb. 5. Shares pulled back, but rebounded off Ubiquiti's [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) on March 5.


The consolidation would forge a short cup-with-handle base by the end of this week if the stock price holds up. The [new entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) would be around 352.72. Ideally, the base will form for at least seven weeks before shares break out. So far, Ubiquiti has consolidated for little more than five weeks.


Some investors may be familiar with the company's former ticker, UBNT. In August 2019, Ubiquiti stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as UI, moving from the Nasdaq. The company changed its name from Ubiquiti Networks.

Ubiquiti Stock: Lockdowns Boost Demand For Services
---------------------------------------------------


Ubiquiti's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 86 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD MarketSmith analysis. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.


In addition, Ubiquiti stock has an[Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of B. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. On an A+ to E scale, the rating measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. An A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Ubiquiti sells wireless networking gear to rural wireless Internet service providers, or WISPs, as well as large companies. Its WISP customers in the U.S. and overseas use unlicensed radio spectrum.


Ubiquiti's overseas markets have included India, Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, the Czech Republic and Poland. Companies in China make Ubiquiti's networking gear.


A few years ago, Ubiquiti disrupted the wireless networking gear market with large price discounts. Rather than utilizing its own direct sales force, Ubiquiti sells products through distributors.


Amid coronavirus pandemic-forced lockdowns, Ubiquiti's fiscal second-quarter revenue surged 56% to $479.4 million. Adjusted earnings climbed 81% to $2.53 a share. Ubiquiti stock climbed on the news.


Cambium Emerges As Rival In Rural Fixed Wireless
------------------------------------------------


In the December quarter, Ubiquiti's service provider technology segment grew 53% to $150 million year-over-year. Sales to large companies increased 56% to $329.5 million.


Despite stellar revenue growth, Jefferies analyst George Notter said Ubiquiti could lose market share to **Cambium Networks** ([CBMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBMB)).


"Based on our checks with fixed wireless service providers, we find that Cambium's products are better-performing, more reliable, and support more subscribers at higher speeds than Ubiquiti's gear," Notter said. "While Ubiquiti counters with lower pricing, we believe that WISPs' needs to scale their service offerings will help Cambium."


In the December quarter, the company repurchased $55 million of Ubiquiti stock. However, its board of directors has not authorized a new repurchase program, analysts said.


Neutral Rating On Ubiquiti Stock
--------------------------------


At Barclays, analyst Tim Long holds a neutral rating on Ubiquiti stock.


"Although the company is growing and has expanded operating margins, we see slower growth and plateauing margins in the future," he said in a report.


One of Long's concerns is that fiscal second-quarter revenue growth slowed from the September quarter, except for the Europe/Middle East region.


"Although the quarter beat across the board, the sequential deterioration in growth across both revenue segments and all geographies concern us that the beneficial work-from-home demand is beginning to stabilize and thus, an inflection point in the business has been reached," Long said.

Dynatrace broke out in late January from 45.27 . But that breakout quickly failed. Sometimes a good stock will do a head-fake and set up again. If it looks good, investors shouldn't shy away from a new breakout.


Dynatrace Stock: App Performance Monitoring Market Crowded
----------------------------------------------------------


The software maker's computer network monitoring tools measure and analyze the performance of business-critical applications. Analysts say the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has forced companies to move apps to cloud computing platforms, increasing demand for Dynatrace monitoring tools.


In addition, Dynatrace competes in the application performance monitoring market versus the AppDynamics unit of **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) and others. Dynatrace has also stepped up investments in sales and marketing.


While there's stiff competition, the cloud-based application performance management software market is expected to boom. IDC forecasts that the worldwide market will grow to $3.94 billion in 2024, up from $1.44 billion in 2019.


Upside from 'Sunburst' Cyberattack?
-----------------------------------


According to a recent UBS report, Dynatrace could be getting a boost from the recent "Sunburst" cyberattack, in which Russian hackers accessed U.S. government computer networks via network management software provided by **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)). Many companies want to monitor information technology departments more aggressively, says UBS.


Dynatrace recently rolled out a new application security product. In addition, Dynatrace uses artificial intelligence tools in its app monitoring platform.


In the September quarter, Dynatrace said it earned an adjusted 17 cents a share, up 70% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 28% to $182.9 million, the company said.


Annual Recurring Revenue Key Metric
-----------------------------------


One key financial metric for Dynatrace stock is annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from customers. ARR growth decelerated in the September quarter but bounced back in the fourth quarter. In the December quarter, Dynatrace said ARR rose 35% to $722 million vs. estimates of $681.3 million.


Also, Dynatrace's subscription revenue rose 33% to $170.3 million vs. estimates of $160.8 million.


For the current quarter ending in March, Dynatrace forecast profit in a range of 13-14 cents a share with revenue of $191 million. Analysts had estimated earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $176.4 million.


Heading into the Dynatrace earnings, the stock owned a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 61 out of a possible 99. Meanwhile, the relative strength line has improved in early 2021.


Dynatrace went public Aug. 1, 2019, backed by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Further, the Dynatrace IPO raised $570 million, with shares priced at 16.

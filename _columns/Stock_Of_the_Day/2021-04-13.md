**Shutterstock** ([SSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSTK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). SSTK stock broke out into a buy zone Tuesday after consolidating from a powerful move following the latest earnings report. Shutterstock earnings growth has surged in recent quarters.




Shutterstock oversees a massive, searchable online library of photographs and other multimedia, It's trying to transition to a subscription model and expand into new types of digital media.


SSTK Stock
----------


SSTK stock jumped 6% to 98.99 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), a new high and clearing a 95.39 buy point of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The double-bottom base bottomed out right around the 50-day moving average.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) is not far from a new high, hitting short-term peaks Tuesday. The RS line, the blue line in the chart provided, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



The double-bottom base formed not long after shares skyrocketed from Shutterstock's fourth-quarter earnings, reported in February.


The company, at that time, forecast full-year earnings per share that were above expectations. The midpoint of Shutterstock's sales forecast, however, came up short.


Still, SSTK stock spiked 24% to 85.35 on Feb. 11, the day of the earnings report. It kept rising to 96.50 on Feb. 19.


Subscribers for the fourth quarter jumped 45% to 281,000. Profits jumped as well, with a 495% increase in net income. Adjusted earnings per share surged 258%, accelerating rapidly for a third straight quarter. Revenue rose 9% to $180.9 million, with growth picking up slightly for a second quarter in a row.


SSTK stock has a strong 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 89.

Shutterstock Moves Into 3D
--------------------------


Shutterstock's customers pay to license the images, videos and music in its library. The company compensates the people who contribute that material accordingly. Customers include marketing professionals, media companies and small businesses.


The company has also moved into 3D graphics, acquiring 3D model developer TurboSquid in February. Such models are used in industries like advertising, gaming, media and architecture, according to Shutterstock's annual report.


Shutterstock has also tried to move more into subscriptions, which it says allow for a set number of content licenses to be downloaded monthly. That approach, Shutterstock says, cuts incremental costs.


The run higher for SSTK stock also comes amid a broader craze for cryptocurrencies and NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Those NFTs allow people to create verifiable, authentic digital assets — like photos and music — that can be sold as unique, singular pieces of property.


Shutterstock last month published a [post on its website about NFTs](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/nfts-monetize-your-photos), saying they "can be an alternate revenue source for creators."


"Although it's still too early to tell, NFTs may become a legitimate way for artists and creators to sell their work," the post said.


A Shutterstock representative declined to comment on whether the company was exploring those digital assets further.


Shutterstock reports first quarter earnings on April 27.

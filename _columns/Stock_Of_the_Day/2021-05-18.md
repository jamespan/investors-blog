**Iqvia Holdings** ([IQV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IQV)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares are forming a tight pattern and Iqvia stock is holding firm to its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).




The first quarter represented a "return of the mojo," Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson said in a recent report to clients. Iqvia is a contract resource organization, meaning it helps biopharma companies design their clinical studies, recruit patients and commercialize their drugs.


Even beyond Covid-related work, Iqvia outperformed expectations, she said. The technology and analytics solution business grew nearly 21% on a strict as-reported basis. Research and development solutions revenue soared close to 30% on a reported basis.


"These factors, along with the large step-up in (next 12 months) expected backlog conversion and the strong biotech funding environment, give us a high degree of confidence in continued strong performance," Anderson said. She raised her price target on Iqvia stock to 260 from 222, and kept her outperform rating.

Iqvia Stock: Marrying A CRO And Patient Data
--------------------------------------------


Iqvia was formed in 2016 during the massive merger of Quintiles and IMS Health. Quintiles was a contract resource organization, while IMS Health was a supplier of health care data. Together, the companies created a powerhouse in recruiting for clinical testing.


Historically, contract resource organizations would tap into a network of doctors to recruit patients for clinical testing, says Nick Childs, Iqvia's vice president of investor relations. But clinical studies have specific patient requirements. Relying on existing relationships with doctors doesn't guarantee the company will find the right types of patients for a clinical study.


That's where IMS Health steps in. Using anonymized patient data — build from pharmacy claims, genomics, social media and other methods — Iqvia helps pinpoint where companies might have the best chance of enrolling the right patients quickly, Childs said. This has led to a 40% reduction in the amount of time it takes to find a site for clinical testing, he said.


"Based on this data, we can speed up the time it takes to deliver a clinical trial," he told Investor's Business Daily. "That's the biggest impact that we've had."


Base Business Is Returning
--------------------------


Those trends have helped propel Iqvia stock. This year, shares have risen more than 29%.


The company's first-quarter report was April 22. On that day, Iqvia stock popped 3.2%. Shares touched a high point at 237.47 on April 29, but have backed off slightly since then. The stock is now forming a four-weeks-tight pattern, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The buy point is 237.57, or 10 cents above the high in the pattern. Shares inched up to 231.59 in recent action.


Overall, revenue increased nearly 24% to $3.41 billion. Adjusted profit of $2.18 per share grew more than 45% year over year. Both measures put Iqvia stock well within the boundaries of CAN SLIM advice. Investors are encouraged to seek stocks with 25% or higher recent sales and earnings growth.


To that point, Iqvia stock has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). The CR is a measure of a stock's technical and fundamental growth measures. This puts its shares in the top 3% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Part of the benefit stems from the Covid pandemic. But even backing out Iqvia's role in clinical tests of Covid vaccines, the base business remains strong, Childs said. Excluding the Covid impact, the technology and analytics solutions business grew a high single-digit percentage in the first quarter. The research and development solutions unit grew a mid-teens percentage, he said.


"The base business is returning," he said. "We're getting back to pre-pandemic levels."


In fact, Iqvia now has a backlog of $23.2 billion. It can take three to five years to run a clinical test, Childs said. That's how much work companies have ordered from Iqvia over the next several years.


Second Quarter Could Improve
----------------------------


Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill was also bullish on Iqvia stock after its first-quarter report. Iqvia management expects strong demand for research and development, and outsourcing to continue beyond 2021. The second quarter could also be stronger than the first, Hill said in a note to clients.


"The robust biotech funding and all-time high pipeline paint an increasingly favorable outlook on the industry," he said. "The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of new technology among many clients, creating a positive long-term trend for Iqvia's differentiated offerings."


For the second quarter, analysts polled by FactSet expect Iqvia's sales to grow 29% and for earnings to surge 73%.


Hill has a buy rating on Iqvia stock.

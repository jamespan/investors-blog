**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of digital contract software breaks out from a three-weeks-tight chart pattern, a bullish signal for many growth stocks. DocuSign stock popped on Thursday as the Nasdaq Composite gained on 2020's first trading day.




Shares of the company popped on Dec. 6 after the rival of **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings. The electronic signature software maker formed a [three-weeks-tight chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) in mid-December after breaking out of a consolidation three months earlier.


DocuSign stock jumped 2.4% to 75.90 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). With sales popping over 40% the last two quarters, DocuSign is one of several top [software growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/saas-stocks-cloud-stocks/) to watch using [IBD's investing tools](https://research.investors.com/).


While DocuSign stock could appear extended from an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 59.72 in September, the three-weeks-tight pattern provides an opportunity for a "follow-on" buy point at 76.38.

DocuSign Stock: Software Partnerships Grow
------------------------------------------


While Adobe competes with DocuSign, the company has partnered with several other large software companies on its own, Chief Executive Daniel Springer told IBD in a recent interview. DocuSign's partners include **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) and **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)).


"When we were still a private company we had an amazing number of partnerships and investors, a lot of large and important software companies," Springer said. "They're go-to-market partners with DocuSign. So the partnership landscape is very significant part of our business."


DocuSign stock went public at 29 in April 2018. The company focuses on industries such as financial services and insurance, telecom and health care/life sciences, Springer said. It's also pushing into the federal government market.


DocuSign rivals are getting swallowed up by larger companies. **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) last year bought HelloSign. And in 2011, Adobe bought EchoSign. Springer says that while Abobe is a formidable foe, DocuSign remains the market leader by far in electronic signatures.


"They're (Adobe) a very good company. We don't take them lightly," he said. "But their part of the signature market is small. It's maybe 1% less or less of their revenue. They're the second player in the space, but we're probably six or seven times their size."


Growth Stocks: Rising Relative Strength A Bullish Signal
--------------------------------------------------------


DocuSign in 2018 acquired SpringCM for $220 million to expand its product line into contract life cycle management. Another acquisition could be coming, DocuSign stock analyst Alex Zukin of RBC Capital said in a recent note to clients.


"We get the sense the company is well-positioned to conduct another strategic deal at this point, though nothing seems imminent," Zukin said. Springer says the company could explore more deals.


DocuSign has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/relative-strength-at-new-high/) of 94 out of a best-possible 99. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. An upward-trending RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


DocuSign stock has an [Accumulation/Distribution Ratin](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/)g of B+. The rating runs from a best-possible A to a worst-possible E. It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A rising Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a clue that institutional buyers are buying.

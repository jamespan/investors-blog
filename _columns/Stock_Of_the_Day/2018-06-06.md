**SVB Financial Group** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the regional lender sets up potential add-on and swing-trading opportunities.







The stock is also worth watching as it could soon form a new base after it rocketed on strong earnings and accelerating revenue growth.


The firm's Silicon Valley Bank focuses on lending to technology companies. It has helped fund more than 30,000 startups, including Airbnb, Pinterest, **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) and **TrueCar** ([TRUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRUE)).


While it is known as the "bank to the tech stars," SVB Financial also serves venture capital and private equity firms investing in the tech and biotech fields. It also offers private banking services for high-net-worth individuals.


Since making a mammoth move following its [April 7 earnings release](https://www.investors.com/news/svb-financial-silicon-valley-bank-stock-rises-earnings/), the stock has been trading in a tight range, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). This presents a possible add-on entry point for existing shareholders, or an entry for a short-term [swing trade](https://swingtrader.investors.com). The correct entry point for both is 328.01. Shares rallied 1.5% to close at 323.59 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/).


And for those eager to get in on the hot stock since its impressive results, if it continues to move sideways for another two weeks it could form a new base.

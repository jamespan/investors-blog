**Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), entered buy range after blowout earnings, while the Wall Street banking giant looks ahead to a merger that will capitalize on the retail investing boom.




**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) topped views but also boosted loan-loss provisions due to its Main Street lending exposure in the coronavirus recession, contrasting with Morgan Stanley's investor-heavy footprint.


Morgan Stanley earnings jumped 59% to $1.96 a share, crushing views for $1.17. Revenue rose 31% to $13.41 billion, easily topping forecasts for $10.78 billion.


Fixed-income trading revenue soared 168% to $3.03 billion, and equity trading revenue climbed 23% to $2.62 billion. Combined trading revenue hit its highest level in a decade.


Investment banking revenue grew 39% to $7.98 billion, boosted by a 64% jump in underwriting revenue as new stock and debt issuance surged.


Wealth management, an increasingly important segment for Morgan Stanley, saw revenue rise 6% to $4.68 billion. That business is about to undergo a transformation with the pending acquisition of **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)). The $13 billion deal was reached in February, marking Wall Street's biggest merger since the financial crash.


On Thursday, CEO James Gorman said the deal remains on track to close late this year. While much of E-Trade's business is aimed at managing what workers get as part of their compensation, retail investing has been booming. Rival **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) reported Thursday that Q2 daily active trades jumped 126% from a year ago to 1.62 million.

Big Bank Stocks Wrap Up Earnings
--------------------------------


Bank of America earnings fell 50% to 37 cents a share, but beat views for 28 cents. Revenue slid 3.5% to $22.3 billion, topping forecasts for $21.76 billion. Consumer banking revenue fell 19% to $7.9 billion. Wealth and investment management revenue dropped 10% to $4.4 billion.


Global banking revenue grew 2% to $5.1 billion, led by investment banking fees. Fixed-income trading revenue jumped 50% to $3.2 billion, and equities trading revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion.


Bank of America stock finished 2.7% lower Thursday.


The results close out a quarter in the which big U.S. bank stocks girded for deeper economic stress due to the coronavirus crisis and piled billions of dollars into their reserves to prepare for difficulties ahead among the customers to which they lend money.


Bank of America's credit loan-loss provision came in at $5.1 billion, up slightly from Q1 but below views.


And as businesses hurried to raise money to safeguard against the pandemic's impact, debt and stock issuances ballooned, helping the banks that underwrite those offerings. Mergers and acquisitions activity quieted, as the pandemic leads to more cautious planning. But one analyst said M&A activity could accelerate in the months ahead.


After Goldman Sachs' earnings, bank stocks analyst Brian Kleinhanzl at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods noted that Goldman's investment banking division was still talking frequently with clients.


"Recent M&A announcements have slowed," he wrote, "but management noted that investment banking client dialogues remain very active, with client interactions up over 30% versus last year."


He continued: "In the second half, there may be a potential pickup in M&A activity, from companies coming from a position of strength as well as those challenged by the Covid-19 environment."

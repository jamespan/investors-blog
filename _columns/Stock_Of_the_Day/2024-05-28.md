Further, Monday.com continues to build up brand awareness vs. rivals. Its marketing strategy spans Facebook and Instagram, internet search engine optimization, online video advertising on YouTube, podcasts and plain-old billboard campaigns.


Monday's marketing aims to drive potential customers to its website, where they can download its software for a trial period. Monday.com generates most of its revenue from subscription plans.


Pushing Into Enterprise Market
------------------------------


The self-service business model has worked well with small and midsize businesses. Also, Monday.com in mid-2018 launched a direct sales strategy. It stepped up hiring of salespeople to expand into the enterprise market.


Meanwhile, JPMorgan's Bora recently met with management.


"Relating to its ability to continue to add large deals, Monday noted that in the wake of a large 25,000 seat deal, it has 'a few interesting deals' in the pipeline," Bora said. "Additionally, the company characterized MondayDB as a 'big unlock' for enterprise customers due to its performance and scale."

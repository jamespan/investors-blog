**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the beleaguered social media giant aims to make 2023 a "year of efficiency." Meta stock is holding up well in a weak and volatile market.




Meta, like all social media companies, is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising. In addition, companies are squirming over macroeconomic concerns, fears of a recession and higher interest rates. This is happening as Facebook is spending billions on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.


In November, Meta cut 11,000 employees, or 13% of its workforce. Meta stock is up 20% since then.


A [report from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-07/meta-is-said-to-plan-thousands-more-layoffs-as-soon-as-this-week?sref=FwsjHXQj) this past week said Meta expects to cut "thousands" more, though it did not give a specific number.


Now, Meta stock is on track to [create a flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). That base is one of the few reliable chart patterns that quality stocks form before they make substantial price advances. The new buy point is 197.26.


In addition, a move above the high of 190.36 set on Tuesday could provide an early entry.


Meta Stock Action Today
-----------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Meta stock dropped 1.2% to close at 179.51.


The company is not alone among major technology companies to announce cutbacks.


Other tech giants — such as **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) — also have announced a large number of layoffs.


Meta reported fourth-quarter results on Feb. 1 that missed estimates, but it announced a $40 billion share buyback. Last year, Meta spent $27.9 billion on share repurchases.


Meta Shares Surge On Efficiency Theme
-------------------------------------


Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, in a statement with the earnings report said, "Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization."


In reaction to the earnings report, Meta stock surged 18.5%.


Like other social media companies, including Snapchat parent **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)), Meta is challenged not only by macroeconomic weakness but by a painful drop in digital advertising.


Meta lost roughly $10 billion in ad revenue last year after **Apple** ([APPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPL)) changed privacy policies for the iPhone. That change made it more difficult to accurately target users with ads.


But Meta has made technology improvements with its new ad strategy.

**Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) is the IBD Stock of the Day. Shares rebounded bullishly from key support a day after the Super Bowl — effectively a chicken-wing holiday in the U.S. Wingstop stock has formed a new handle buy point a few weeks after a prior breakout failed. Several other restaurant stocks are faring well, including **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)).




Wingstop Stock Takes Flight
---------------------------


Shares of the chicken-wing chain jumped 3.8% to close at 67.99 in the [stock market today,](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) bouncing off their 50-day line in heavy volume. The 50-day line is a key test of investor support. Wingstop stock has a new high handle entry of 72.32.



That new buy point is just above a Jan. 11 breakout attempt, with Wingstop stock hitting 72.22, briefly topping a then-proper entry of 72.10.


Wingstop stock has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91, out of a best-possible 99. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is off last month's highs.


Wingstop stock was added to [IBD Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/) on Monday.

NFL's Super Bowl Is Wingstop's Super Bowl
-----------------------------------------


The National Chicken Council last month predicted that nearly 1.4 billion chicken wings would be consumed over Super Bowl LIII weekend, up 2% from a year ago.


Last year, Wingstop reported a "record Super Bowl performance," selling more than 14 million wings. That marked a gain vs. previous years, management said. This year, however, Super Bowl viewership hit a 10-year low amid a low-scoring game.


Wingstop stock surged 85% last year. But with that ascent has come concerns that the valuation might be a little too high. Morgan Stanley in October downgraded the stock "[purely on valuation.](https://www.investors.com/news/top-stock-wingstop-analyst-downgrade/)" But the firm said fundamentals — namely its same-store sales and plans to open more stores — were still strong.


Those trends appeared to continue through Q4. Wingstop on Jan. 14 reported a preliminary fourth-quarter same-store sales gain of 6% in the U.S. The figure topped the already-high consensus estimates for a 4.9% gain. But the stock fell despite the results, [wiping out a breakout attempt](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/wingstop-stock-dennys-del-taco-q4-early-results/).


While other fast-food chains try to out-discount one another, Cowen analysts last year said Wingstop has been "well insulated" from such discounts. The company also has expanded its digital-ordering and delivery businesses, aided by a partnership with DoorDash. Wingstop is estimated to boost national TV ad spending by 50% this year, according to Cowen.


Restaurant Stocks
-----------------


Several other restaurant stocks are at or near buy points. Yum Brands — parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut — nudged into a buy zone in light volume Monday


Domino's stock and Starbucks stock are both on IBD Leaderboard. Domino's stock has a 285.01 handle buy point in a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Starbucks stock has pulled back slightly after trying to clear a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) buy point of 69.08 late last week.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is slightly extended from a double-bottom base. Chipotle stock is consolidating right at its old highs.

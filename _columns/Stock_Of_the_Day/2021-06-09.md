**Vale** ([VALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VALE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Brazilian miner is looking to exit the coal business. Vale stock is working on a new buy point.




The shift away from coal comes amid a global shift to cleaner-burning fuels. On Wednesday, Vale announced a settlement tied to the divestment of its Moatize coal operation in Mozambique.


Vale is also a major iron ore, nickel and copper producer. With the coal exit, Vale hopes to become a leader in low carbon mining and to be carbon neutral by 2050.


Meanwhile, the economic recovery is broadly lifting mining stocks. Plus, President Joe Biden's proposed nearly $2 trillion infrastructure bill lifted the mining sector.


Iron ore is a key ingredient in steel. Copper and nickel are key commodities used in electric vehicles. Therefore, Vale stock and its peers stand to benefit from higher infrastructure spending and the global shift to electric cars.


In a market with sectors showing strength in flux, investors should keep an eye on those that are still showing decent action as they set up again.


Several other miners besides Vale are trying to consolidate. But mining stocks tend to be volatile, driven by commodity prices. **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) made [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) May 5 as it broke out on rising metal prices.

Vale Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares rose 1.2% to close at 22.15 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), after finding support just above the 10-week line two weeks ago. Vale stock is poised to form a flat base with a 23.12 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) by Friday, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It's roughly 4% below the entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Vale stock has rallied close to highs. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index. It is the blue line in the chart shown. Vale's RS line has been uneven in the longer term.


Among other mining stocks, Rio Tinto fell 2% Wednesday, **BHP** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) lost 2.1%, and **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) eased 1.35%.


Vale stock is No. 1 in its industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx).


Its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Composite+Rating+SmartSelect&termid=1), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics in a single easy-to-use score, is an unbeatable 99.


Vale holds a solid [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90 out of a possible 99. That means it has outperformed 90% of all stocks in the past year.


And Vale looks good on other technical metrics as well. It shows five quarters of rising fund ownership and a superior A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://bit.ly/3gxEv8u), a sign of institutional buying of shares over the past 13 weeks. As of March, 545 funds owned shares, up 2% from the prior quarter.


Vale Earnings and Fundamentals
------------------------------


In 2021, Wall Street sees Vale earnings vaulting 389% to $4.65 per share as sales jump nearly 42%, according to FactSet. The Brazilian miner sports a mediocre [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS+Rating&termid=1) of 69 out of 99, reflecting in part 2019's losses. Its [SMR Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=SMR+Rating&termid=1) is an A, on a scale of A to a worst E.


Vale went through a tough 2019, marked by a disaster that killed almost 300 people at its iron ore mine in Brumadinho, Brazil. In February, the miner reached a global settlement tied to the tragedy, helping to de-risk Vale stock.


On April 27, Vale reported record first-quarter earnings of $8.5 billion, despite a seasonally weak period and the pandemic's acceleration in Brazil. The coronavirus outbreak had forced Vale to restrict operations to essential workers at its sites. Now only a quarter of its workforce is still working remotely, Vale said.


In Q1, iron ore output rose 14% and nickel production rose 7%.


"Our beginning of the year was stronger than 2020," CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo said on an earnings call. "We produced in this first quarter, which is seasonally weaker, the same as we produced in the second quarter of 2020. This gives us a lot of confidence in reaching our production guidance for this year."


For 2021, Vale issued production guidance of 315 million-335 million tons.


Fourteen analysts rate Vale stock a buy and one has a sell, FactSet says.

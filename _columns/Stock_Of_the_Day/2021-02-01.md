**AdaptHealth** ([AHCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AHCO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The medical equipment supplier went on a buying spree in 2020 and, on Monday, AHCO stock broke out to a record high.




The company sells medical devices to treat conditions related to sleep and respiration. It also supplies continuous glucose monitors for patients with diabetes.


In addition to a strong track record of acquisitions, AdaptHealth expects long-term organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%.


Deutsche Bank analyst Pito Chickering estimates AdaptHealth owns 20% of its addressable markets. The biggest risk for AdaptHealth now is integrating the companies it bought in 2020.


"The difference, we believe, between AdaptHealth and the failed roll-ups is that AdaptHealth is offering equity to the leaders of the large acquisitions, and leveraging that leadership to continue growing organically," Chickering said in a report to clients.

Chickering has a buy rating on AHCO stock. In December, he raised his price target on AHCO stock to 47 from 36.


AHCO Stock Breaks Out
---------------------


On [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AHCO stock climbed 4.9% to close at 40.15. That put AHCO stock just above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 39.86 out of a consolidation on the weekly chart, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Earlier in the session, it notched a record high of 41.58.


Last year, AdaptHealth announced its takeovers of Solara Medical Supplies, ActivStyle and AeroCare. The acquisition of AeroCare helps AdaptHealth broaden into sleep and respiratory markets. AeroCare sells oxygen concentrators, home ventilators and CPAP machines.



Sleep aid is an attractive, high-single-digit growth opportunity. In the third quarter, sleep device sales accounted for 35% of revenue. Diabetes devices were 19% of AdaptHealth's revenue. The respiratory segment is considered low growth, but it comes with recurring revenue.


Further, although AeroCare isn't in the diabetes space, the acquisition offers plenty of cross-selling opportunities, Chickering said. Typical sleep apnea patients are often overweight and may also be diabetes patients. This should help AHCO stock, he said.


Those cross-selling opportunities are "the first two revenue capture opportunities we expect to see, likely beginning in the second quarter of 2021," he said. "We suspect the tail on this cross-selling opportunity could continue to lift revenue growth in 2022."


Representatives of AdaptHealth couldn't immediately comment.


Bullish Growth Expectations
---------------------------


Revenue growth is bullish for AHCO stock.


In the December quarter, analysts polled by FactSet expect AdaptHealth to post 115% growth to $321.6 million in sales. Adjusted earnings of 19 cents per share would mark a turnaround from a year-ago loss of 10 cents a share.


Growth is expected to improve again in the March quarter, with sales soaring 140%.


AHCO stock has a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 92 out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating is a 1-99 measure of a stock's 12-month performance. This puts AHCO stock in the top 8% of all stocks on that bar, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital).


AHCO stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


Shares hit a low point at 7.82 in late 2019. Since then, AHCO stock has run up 403%.

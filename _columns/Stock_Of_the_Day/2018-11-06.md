Payment-processing firm **EVO Payments** ([EVOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVOP)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as EVO stock works on a base heading into its quarterly earnings report Wednesday. A recent IPO, EVO earnings growth estimates for 2019 are strong.




Stock Of The Day: EVO Stock Technical Analysis
----------------------------------------------


In the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) today, EVO stock rose 0.7% to 24.94. EVO stock is [finding support at the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-school-using-regenerons-five-year-rally-to-study-support/) as it works on a consolidation base. The IBD Stock Of The Day is trading 11% below the 27.97 buy point. EVO earnings early Wednesday could be a catalyst.


But buying a stock ahead of its quarterly earnings report is risky. Unless you are using an [earnings options strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/option-trading-eli-lilly-trade-desk-earnings/), wait for EVO stock to break out of the base in heavy volume before buying. If EVO stock gaps up more than 5% above the entry point, it's OK to [buy the stock as close to the open price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) as possible.



But that's only a possible scenario if EVO stock rises on earnings. If EVO misses analyst expectations or provides weak guidance, the stock could fall.


Keep in mind that the stock market correction hasn't ended. A market rally is underway, but there's been no follow-through day yet to confirm a new uptrend. Making any purchases right now is risky.

**Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it breaks out into a buy zone amid analysts foreseeing bumper growth opportunities ahead, while rival payment stocks are working on their own buy points.




Earlier this year, Global Payments sealed a $21.5 billion deal to acquire Total System Services. Analysts believe this could provide a big engine for growth. It was one of three megamergers to take place in the payments space this year.


Global Payments offers e-commerce, omnichannel and cross-border payment processing products. A specific strength highlighted by analysts is its integrated point-of-sale products for small and mid-size businesses.


The firm's OpenEdge platform allows merchants to accept card, electronic, check and digital payments and uses software to simplify the tracking process. It includes security features such as end-to-end encryption and tokenization.

Global Payments' strong offerings and early-mover advantage have helped it vacuum up small to mid-size businesses. Other big beasts in the integrated processing space include Worldpay, which itself was acquired by **Fidelity National Information Services** ([FIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIS)) earlier this year for $34 billion.

Fidelity National rose 1.3% to 135.50, closing in on a 141.45 entry. **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) edged up 0.8% to 293.41, heading for a 304.75 buy point. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) rose 0.4% to 179.75, nearing a 187.15 pivot, and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) ticked up 0.6% to 279.63, edging closer to a 293.79 buy point. **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), which reports next week, added 2.7% to 36.95 and has formed a new handle with a 39.55 entry.


Global Payments stock has bounced higher off a recent test at [its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). In addition, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is again ascending and could soon regain its all-time high from early September.



Global Payments stock is up more than 71% so far in 2019. It has a near-perfect [IBD Composite Rating of 97](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/), putting it in the top 3% of names tracked.


[IBD Stock Checkup shows](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-global-payments-inc-gpn.aspx) its three-year annual earnings growth rate at 26%. This is above the 25% minimum target required by [CAN SLIM guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). However, EPS growth has averaged 18% over the past three quarters.


On Oct. 31, the company reported Q3 EPS that rose 15% to $1.70, clearing views for $1.66, on a 28% revenue surge to $1.31 billion, above expectations for $1.16 billion. Management raised its full-year EPS view to $6.12-$6.20 from $6.00-$6.15.


Analysts Back Global Payments Stock
-----------------------------------


Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri, who rates Global Payments stock at outperform with a 185 target, said this year's megadeals facilitate the rise of new platforms that serve both financial institutions and merchants. He sees Global Payments as being in a pole position to take advantage.


"The convergence of payments and software continues to provide a critical differentiation among vendors — GPN is the big winner," he said in a Nov. 1. research note. "Combining business applications/software with payments processing capabilities creates a frictionless, integrated experience, while allowing merchants to more effectively serve consumers."


The Total System Services deal is already going better than expected, with Global Payments last month saying it now expects to realize annual run-rate revenue synergies of at least $125 million and annual run-rate expense synergies of at least $325 million within three years. This is higher than its prior view of $100 million and $300 million, respectively.


Piper Jaffray senior analyst Jason Deleeuw believes the guidance given on Total System Services will turn out to be conservative over the longer term.


"GPN already raised its cost and revenue synergy guidance, and we believe it is likely GPN will exceed those new, higher targets over the next three years," he said in an Oct. 31 research note, rating the stock at overweight with a 198 target. "We believe the combined GPN-TSYS business is a stable, scaled business model insulated through macro cycles and leading secular technological change."

While artificial intelligence promises to transform many industries, many companies struggle to deploy and scale up AI software to gain a competitive edge. The [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)), makes it easier for companies to build artificial intelligence applications with its off-the-shelf tools and avoid costly customization projects.




C3.ai's initial public offering in early December raised $651 million, but the enterprise software maker has yet to turn a profit. In the April 2020 fiscal year, revenue rose 71% to $156.7 million, with its net loss doubling to $69 million.


In addition, some investors point to C3.ai's pedigree. Thomas Siebel, who started Siebel Systems and sold it to **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) for nearly $6 billion in 2006, founded C3.ai.


C3.ai stock jumped its first two weeks of trading, hitting an all-time intraday high of 183.90 on Dec. 23. The stock pulled back, retreating to an intraday low of 112.05 on Jan. 6.

C3.ai Stock Builds IPO Base
---------------------------


C3.ai stock has now consolidated, [forming an IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a proper [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 184. There's also an earlier buy point of 151.94 just above its Jan. 14 high. C3.ai is just one of many [AI stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).


Wall Street analysts that do not rate AI stock a buy generally point to its lofty valuation as a multiple of 2022 estimated revenue. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh is in that group.


However, in a report Singh noted that "C3.ai enables enterprises to rapidly build and deploy machine learning applications that can transform their business operations."


All AI software needs computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. AI technology uses computer algorithms. The software programs aim to mimic the human ability to learn, interpret patterns and make predictions.


"Machine learning" is the most widely used form of AI deployed in industries. Machine learning systems use huge troves of data to train algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions.


At Deutsche Bank, analyst Patrick Colville started coverage with a hold rating.


Artificial Intelligence Application Market To Boom
--------------------------------------------------


"The ecosystem of off-the-shelf AI software remains highly fragmented, and the bulk of tools are vertical or use-case specific," the C3.ai stock analyst said in a report to clients. "We see **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) most often included in competitive situations vs. C3, but in our view adoption of AI remains so embryonic that there is space for multiple vendors to grow into the opportunity."


Market research firm IDC forecasts that the AI applications market will pop to $227 billion in 2024 from $107 billion in 2019. Still, many companies require the help of systems integrators such as **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)) and **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) to develop AI applications.


In the energy industry, C3.ai has teamed with **Baker Hughes** ([BKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKR)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) to use artificial intelligence in preventive maintenance. Microsoft invested $50 million in C3.ai prior to its IPO. In October, Microsoft and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) partnered with C3.ai to sell customer relationship management software.


In financial services, C3.ai has partnered with **Fidelity National Information Services** ([FIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIS)). And, in the defense market, C3.ai partnered with **Raytheon** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)).


When companies launch artificial intelligence projects, C3.ai's platform enables software developers to write apps using much less programming code.


Customers also can re-use code for different applications.


C3.ai Stock: Competition Heats Up In Providing AI Tools
-------------------------------------------------------


In addition, C3.ai faces competition from startup DataRobot, **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) and **Salesforce.com**'s ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) Tableau, says a Bank of America report.


But C3.ai provides a broader solution, Bank of America analyst Brad Sills says in his note to clients.


"C3.ai offers a comprehensive end-to-end solution that spans data integration, batch processing, stream processing, data management, machine learning framework development, application development, and data visualization," said Sills, who has a neutral rating on C3.ai stock.


"This compares to the current platform infrastructure landscape within organizations, which can often have several point solutions that address a key point within the platform infrastructure, such as DataRobot for machine learning, Databricks for batch processing, Confluence for data integration, and Tableau for data visualization."


Further, many companies don't have the computing power in-house to process AI applications. Also, C3.ai has partnered with the three biggest providers of cloud computing services. They're Amazon Web Services, part of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)); Microsoft and **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google.


However, the cloud computing service providers also sell their own AI application development tools.


C3.ai stock dropped 4.3.% to close at 141.43 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

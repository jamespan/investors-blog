LGI Homes stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the homebuilder rebounds off a key test of investor support, while also setting up in a consolidation.




The setup comes after **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) reported [second-quarter earnings last month that beat estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/lgi-homes-earnings-q2-2020-topbuild-earnings/), as low mortgage rates and the coronavirus pandemic propel housing demand.


And with big tech stocks potentially hitting a ceiling after long runs higher this year, stronger nontech plays could still have more room for gains.

Housing Market Booms
--------------------


LGI Homes builds entry-level single-family homes in its home state of Texas, and moved into the South and Northwest. Demand for entry-level homes is expected to rise, as more millennials start buying houses and having families.


Earnings for the second quarter climbed 21%. Revenue rose 4%. Home closings rose 3%. And it said that orders for July rose 60% compared with a year earlier. LGI Homes stock, however, fell after the report.


"Despite the headwinds created by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, a combination of low interest rates, an undersupply of existing homes and a renewed appreciation for the value of homeownership drove strong demand in May and June resulting in our highest backlog ever," CEO Eric Lipar said in a statement last month.


Along with LGI Homes stock, other homebuilder stocks have rebounded from the dive that markets took in March. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) has a Composite Rating of 90. **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) — which installs insulation, windows and gutters — has a Composite Rating of 96.

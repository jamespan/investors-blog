**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the specialty discounter attempted to break out from a bullish double-bottom base. Dollar General stock is moving along with several other bargain chains and other retailers as a newly confirmed stock market rally builds momentum.




The [retail sector](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) performed notably well last year. The [Retail-Discount & Variety](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-04-2019/) group, which includes Dollar General stock, got a boost Monday on news that activist fund [Starboard Value has built a position](https://www.investors.com/news/starboard-dollar-tree-urges-family-dollar-sale-raise-prices/) in **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), pushing the chain to explore ways to unlock value. In addition, both teen-focused **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and off-price apparel chain **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) have flashed bullish signs by bouncing above their 50-day moving averages.


But several other retail industry groups also led the market Monday. Top retail and restaurant names such as **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) made bullish moves.


Dollar General Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------------


Dollar General stock rose 4.1% to close at 112.94 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/), after moving above an eight-week double-bottom-base buy point of 113.25 intraday, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). KeyBank upgraded Dollar General stock to overweight with a 125 price target


One thing to watch the next time the stock attempts a breakout is volume, which was about average on Monday. Investors should look for top stocks to break out on volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal to signal institutional buying.


A bullish indicator for Dollar General stock is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/). The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. that of the S&P 500 index, is at an all-time high.



The [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) is a W-shaped pattern. The second leg of the W must undercut the first leg, shaking out weak holders. The middle of the W must be above the midpoint of the broader pattern. The buy point is 10 cents above the middle of the W. Sometimes a handle will form, creating a slightly lower or higher entry. It is one of the most common chart patterns among huge stock market winners, [IBD research shows](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735787&nav=IBDUCourse6).

**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the managed care stock hit a buy zone intraday clearing its coronavirus trading range to reach an all-time high. UnitedHealth stock led a move among managed care stocks, which as showing strength as the coronavirus stock market rally rotates beyond big tech.




The move by UnitedHealth, a Dow Jones stock and the No. 1 health care insurer, comes as a number of managed care players are in buy range or hitting new highs. **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) stock and **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)) stock rallied, entering or extending moves into buy zones. **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) hit a new high on Thursday, while **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) appeared headed for a new closing high. **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) joined the move, surging above its 200-day moving average.


UNH Stock Hits Buy Zone
-----------------------


Shares rose as high as 309.66 in Thursday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), a record high. UnitedHealth stock backed off settling for a 0.1% gain at 303.97 as the major indexes reversed sharply lower. Intraday, UNH stock cleared a 304.10 handle buy point as well as 306.81, just above the left hand side of the base. The 14-week consolidation started just as the stock market peaked on Feb. 19.


UnitedHealth stock has solidly outperformed the S&P 500, which is 11% off its record high.


UNH stock is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


UNH stock's outperformance is reflected in its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line, the blue line in IBD charts, is well above February levels. But it remains below its April 16 peak, the second day of a post-earnings relief rally. That means UNH stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index over the past six weeks. If this rotation has staying power, look for UnitedHealth's RS line to hit new highs.


Thursday's breakout for UNH stock came on below-average volume. Ideally, breakouts should come on well above-average volume to indicate institutional buying.


However, on Wednesday, UNH stock cleared a more aggressive buy point at 300.10, a handle-like resistance area within the overall handle. Wednesday's move came on slightly above-average volume.


UnitedHealth Stock: Reasons To Buy
----------------------------------


While volume and relative-strength signals are mixed, UnitedHealth stock checks a number of key boxes for investors looking for quality stocks with solid earnings growth. UNH stock has a strong 97 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a possible 99. The Composite Rating combines several key fundamental and technical factors into a single score. IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.


UNH stock also is on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders Watchlist](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). Long-Term Leaders looks for stable earners that consistently deliver superior results and are suitable for slightly different investing strategies than less-mature high-growth stocks.


UnitedHealth is not a high-growth tech name, but that can be a plus. In a portfolio of volatile growth stocks, UNH stock provides a counterbalance. Notably, UnitedHealth stock rose on Tuesday and Wednesday, when many growth leaders suffered wild intraday swings or losses.


UnitedHealth stock is one of only a trio of Dow Jones components to surpass pre-coronavirus highs. The others are **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), and the latter has backed off its Covid-19 peak.


UnitedHealth Outlook
--------------------


After topping first quarter earnings estimates with "minimal impact" from Covid-19, UnitedHealth maintained full-year earnings guidance, predicting positive and negative effects to roughly offset.


As coronavirus cases spiraled in March, insured members deferred nonemergency procedures. That lowered UnitedHealth's outlays on medical costs for insured members, a positive for earnings. Medical costs were lower than expected, falling to 81% of premiums, down from 82% a year ago. That balanced out cost increases for coronavirus testing and 10,000 Covid-19 patients.


UnitedHealth's Optum medical services unit drove Q1 growth, with revenue rising 24.6%. Its UnitedHealthcare managed care division saw 4.4% growth.


Medicare Advantage customers rose 305,000 from Q4 to 5.575 million. But commercial insurance members served by UnitedHealth fell 720,000 to 27.04 million, worse than expected.


UnitedHealth predicted a significant rise in medical costs in the second half of the year due to pent-up demand from deferred procedures and untreated conditions. But that will be at least partly offset by an increase in revenue for its Optum health services empire that includes 45,000 primary care physicians and 200 surgery centers. The loss of commercial insured members will be offset to some extent by increases in its Medicaid managed care programs.


Another potential issue: Political headlines could come back to bite the group ahead of the 2020 election. While Medicare-for-all never looked especially realistic, former Vice President Joe Biden supports a public option that would have a Medicare-like government plan compete against private insurers. If Biden wins — and Democrats win the Senate — a public option could conceivably debut as early as 2023.


Cigna Stock, Anthem Stock Hit Buy Points
----------------------------------------


Cigna stock rose 0.6% to 200.57. Intraday, shares hit 205, clearing a 202.85 cup-with-handle buy point after a prior handle entry fizzled after earnings.


Anthem stock also is in buy range from an entry around 286-288. Anthem stock climbed 1.4% to 291.37.


Cigna stock and Anthem stock, like UnitedHealth, rose on both Tuesday and Wednesday.

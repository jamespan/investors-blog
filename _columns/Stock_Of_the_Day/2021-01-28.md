[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) is presenting investors with a tricky choice — if NVCR stock fails in its current rebound attempt, shares will enter selling territory.




Novocure makes a cancer treatment device that relies on electric fields at specific frequencies to disrupt uncontrolled cell division. NVCR stock's knotty movement Thursday follows a bullish preannouncement earlier this month. Fourth-quarter sales rocketed 45% to $144 million.


The company successfully billed $9 million in fee-for-service Medicare claims. That helped Novocure to handily beat expectations for $135 million in fourth-quarter sales, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten said in a recent report to clients.


Chief Financial Officer Ashley Cordova noted the company is gaining traction with the Medicare appeals process.


"We're beginning to see a material volume of previously denied Medicare coverage denials advance to (administrative law judge) hearing in a heavily backlogged (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) appeal process," she said in an email. "These appeals are related to bills prior to established coverage."

NVCR Stock: Medicare Benefit Continues
--------------------------------------


Novocure makes Optune, a body-worn cancer treatment device. Optune can be used in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma and mesothelioma — cancers of the brain and lungs, respectively. The company is testing its technology in myriad other cancers.


Optune first gained Medicare coverage in late 2019, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in his note to clients. It's now working through a backlog of Medicare claims. In all of 2020, the company recorded $19 million in Medicare revenue, he said.


"We conservatively assume this amount will continue for the foreseeable future," he said. "We estimate total Medicare backlog of $150 million to $200 million from initial U.S. Optune launch through official coverage in late 2019."


Biegelsen has an equal weight rating on NVCR stock. He raised his price target to 130 from 116.



Pivotal Studies Ongoing In 2021
-------------------------------


Most expect 2021 to be a pivotal year for NVCR stock.


The company is testing its Optune technology in patients with various cancers including the liver, lungs, stomach and ovaries. Optune works by attaching sticky patches to the body. Those patches transmit a key electric field that Novocure calls a "tumor-treating field."


Optune aims to interrupt mitosis, the driving force behind cancerous growth. Novocure's Optune can be used with standard cancer drugs. The only side effect is a feeling of warmth on the skin.


"Novocure continues to aggressively advance their development pipeline as they launched three new clinical studies last year and have eight ongoing global studies," Wedbush's Nierengarten said.



In the current quarter, he expects Novocure to have data from a liver cancer study. This year, the company expects to unveil interim analyses from studies in lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. The company could also have the results of a midstage stomach cancer test.


"2021 should be an important year for Novocure, where positive trial data could de-risk the company's platform across multiple indications, which would lead to more meaningful upside to current share levels," Nierengarten said.


Nierengarten has a neutral rating on NVCR stock. But he raised his price target to 159 from 110.


Buy Or Sell NVCR Stock? It Depends
----------------------------------


Still, NVCR stock was in odd territory on Thursday. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), shares rose 3% to 161.30.


Shares bounced off their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), but remained below their [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Savvy investors can consider Novocure stock a hold until it makes a definitive move. If shares dip below a recent low over the past few weeks, that would trigger a sell.


But investors could also take on NVCR stock here, sizing their positions off a low point at 154.45 on Jan. 6, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It's important to note there's a market risk here. The market could resume selling, or it could roar back quickly, extend and trigger another pullback.


Amid the shaky stock action this month, NVCR stock maintained a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 89. The RS Rating is a 1-99 measure of a stock's 12-month performance. NVCR stock ranks among the upper echelon of stocks with an RS Rating of at least 80, according to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital).

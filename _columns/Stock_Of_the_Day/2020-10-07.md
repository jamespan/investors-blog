**Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the content delivery network service has seen its shares surge amid strong demand for its technology to speed up websites and apps. Fastly stock rocketed above a buy point Wednesday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Fastly stock soared 19.8% to close at 120.33. The stock had been [consolidating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) for the past 10 weeks with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 117.89, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.


However, its run-up this week has been so steep that there's a risk of a pullback now that Fastly stock has hit its buy point. [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/) recommend starting with a small position if a stock breaks out under these circumstances.


Fastly stock has been on a tear since Sept. 21, when it jumped over its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/).

TikTok Called 'Major Risk' For Fastly Stock
-------------------------------------------


The San Francisco-based company posted a surprise profit in its [second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastly-earnings-fsly-fastly-stock-q22020/) on Aug. 5. Fastly earned an adjusted 2 cents a share, vs. a year-earlier loss of 16 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30. Sales rose 62% year over year to $74.7 million.


"As the global pandemic continues to accelerate the need for businesses to focus on digital transformation, the demand for a modern, fast, and secure edge platform like ours continues to increase," Fastly Chief Executive Joshua Bixby said in a [news release](https://www.fastly.com/press/press-releases/fastly-announces-second-quarter-2020-financial-results).


Fastly also disclosed that controversial Chinese mobile video app TikTok is its biggest customer, accounting for 12% of its revenue.


Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan downgraded Fastly stock to perform, or neutral, on the news. The possibility of a TikTok ban in the U.S. over security concerns is a "major risk" for Fastly.

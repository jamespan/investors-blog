Keep in mind that amid the coronavirus stock market crash, all stock purchases are highly risky. Until market volatility settles down, it's probably not a good time to be buying any stocks.


Everbridge Stock: New Shield Products Unveiled
----------------------------------------------



Everbridge stock popped nearly 16% on Monday after it hosted an online analyst day. Management said the company's emergency communications platform had sent 33 million Covid-19 related messages in the past week. Shares jumped 5.7% Tuesday to close at 122.59.


At the investor event, it also announced a new platform aimed at companies and government agencies responding to the fast-spreading coronavirus.


The new "Covid-19 Shield" product aims to get new customers up and running with Everbridge's platform in 48 hours. Everbridge's communications servers will send out texts and push notifications to employees and supply chains. The alerts may be about coronavirus-related outbreaks in cities or potential lockdowns.


"Our level of engagement with customers has been through the roof since this started happening," Chief Executive David Meredith told Investor's Business Daily in an interview. "They're all looking for help. We have a lot of capabilities that are on the shelf ready to go. They're looking for not just our software-as-a-service technology but also our expertise."


Pricing ranges from $50,000 to $2 million for three versions of the Covid-19 Shield products.


Everbridge stock popped again on Tuesday as analysts mulled Everbridge's growth prospects in the wake of the coronavirus emergency. While there could be upside, one analyst noted that Everbridge does have exposure to industries impacted by the Covid-19 emergency.


Will Customers Have Time In Covid-19 Emergency?
-----------------------------------------------


"While it remains early days, we anticipate the evolving public health crisis creates more awareness for next-generation public warning and critical event management offerings, which likely benefits Everbridge in both the near and long term," Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick said in a report to clients.


Zelnick added: "In terms of revenue impact from the situation, the company noted it is too early to tell as some deal cycles are shortening while others could potentially lengthen (likely larger/more complex Critical Event Management deals)."


Also, William Blair analyst Matt Stotler is cautious.


"While we expect the pandemic to ultimately validate the value of the Everbridge platform, we view the near-term business impact as somewhat uncertain," Stotler said in his note to clients. "From an end-market perspective, we believe that the company has significant exposure within the corporate segment to the retail, travel and hospitality sectors, which are under heavy economic pressure."


Stotler added: "Awareness of the Everbridge platform seems to be increasing as a result of the pandemic and the company has made efforts to leverage web-centric go-to-market resources in the current environment, but we expect that the reality of the situation is that many potential customers are understandably distracted trying to manage the crisis at hand."


Everbridge stock has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of A+. The rating runs from a best-possible A+ to a worst-possible E. It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A rising accumulation/Distribution Rating is a clue that institutional buyers are buying.


Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes maintains a buy rating on Everbridge stock. But he's cautious on near-term gains because it could take the company time to set up new customers.


Guidance Not Updated For Coronavirus Stock Market Crash
-------------------------------------------------------


"There's no doubt that heightened attention to emergency preparedness and response will have positive longer-term implications for Everbridge," he said in a note. "However, we'd remind investors that the firm's more robust use cases for CEM and public alerting are deals that typically land with annual contracts in the mid-six-figures and up, often with implementation cycles that measure in months and quarters."


At the investor day, Everbridge announced a new statewide deal with Massachusetts. Existing U.S. customers include federal agencies as well as Florida, New York, California, Connecticut and Vermont.


In 2019, Everbridge reported sales of $201 million, up 37%, with an adjusted per-share loss of 21 cents.


The company did not update guidance at the analyst day on Monday. In February, Everbridge forecast full-year 2020 revenue in a range of $260.3 million to $262.3 million, up 30% at the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had projected $257.7 million.


Further, the company guided 2020 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in a range of $6 million to $7 million, below analyst expectations for $10.5 million, on continued investments in research and development and sales and marketing.

Financial services firm **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) is the IBD [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it looks to clear an add-on entry. TransUnion stock edged lower in the shortened trading session Tuesday, after briefly topping a four-weeks-tight buy point.




TransUnion Stock
----------------


Our Stock Of The Day found support near its 10-week moving average last week. Shares fell 0.4% to 72.41 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) after briefly hitting 73.56 intraday.


While TransUnion stock is trying to clear the four-weeks-tight entry of 73.32, volume is light due to the short, preholiday session. When a stock clears a buy point and enters buy range, heavy volume is bullish as it signals institutional support.


Another bullish indicator is an upward-sloping [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500 index. TransUnion stock's RS line is strong and continuing to hit new high ground. If the RS line is at a new high as a stock breaks out, that's a good sign.

Add-On Buy Point
----------------


A three- or four-weeks-tight buy point develops when a stock closes in a tight range for three or four weeks in a row.


Something key to note about the [four-weeks-tight entry](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) is that it's an opportunity to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one. And because of that, you want to buy as close to the buy point as possible, rather than following the 5% buy rule for breakouts from proper bases.


Stock Of The Day
----------------


Speaking of proper bases, TransUnion stock is now extended some 19% from a [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) buy point of 61.52. Our Stock Of The Day cleared that level on April 20 as it gapped up 10% in heavy volume after [TransUnion's accelerating earnings and sales growth](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/transunion-reports-earnings-stock-buy-point-experian-equifax/).


TransUnion is a data-centric business. The company, whose services include credit reporting, fraud detection and customer analytics, will issue its next quarterly report in a few weeks.


Analysts expect earnings to rise 26% while revenue increases 14%. That's a slowdown from the 36% bottom-line growth and 18% top-line growth TransUnion saw in the March quarter.


[TransUnion stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-transunion-tru.aspx) fundamentals and technicals are reflected by a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 98 out of 99. The Composite Rating includes earnings and sales growth, margins, ROE and price performance in its calculation.


TransUnion stock is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


A few of TransUnion's notable peers in the Financial Services-Specialty industry group are **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)), **Broadridge** ([BR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BR)), **Envestnet** ([ENV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENV)) and **FIS** ([FIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIS)).

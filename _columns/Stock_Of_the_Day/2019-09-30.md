**Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products hits a buy point in Monday's [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Trex stock has been making monster gains, up 78% from its October 2018 low, as analysts see Trex earnings growth rebounding ahead.




The company offers a range of products in categories such as decking, railing, fencing, steel deck framing and outdoor lighting. All Trex decking, railing, and fencing products are manufactured in the U.S.


Trex Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------


Shares rose 1.1% to 90.94 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), just above the 90.84 buy point, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). The [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-cup-with-handle/), going back to September 2018, was 44% deep, which is not ideal. But Trex stock bottomed way back in October 2018, and blasted out of a consolidation within the larger base following earnings on July 30.


Volume was above average but less than the 40%-50% minimum investors like to see as a sign of institutional buying.


Trex stock is performing well. In addition its [relative strength line is now at all-time highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/). This is important, as the RS line compares a stock's price performance to the broader S&P 500.



Trex Earnings Rebound Seen
--------------------------


Trex stock has an excellent [IBD Composite Rating of 96](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). Over the past three years, Trex earnings growth has averaged 31% annually. However [the Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-trex-company-inc-trex.aspx) shows earnings have lagged as Trex stock has rebounded. Trex earnings have actually fallen in the prior two quarters. Revenue growth has decelerated in the last four quarters, from 31% to 0%.


Why the disconnect between Trex earnings and stock?


Earlier this year the firm said results had been hampered by startup costs and related inefficiencies associated with production of Trex Enhance Naturals and Basics decking lines. In addition two equipment failures at its Nevada facility during Q1 caused the loss of two production lines for more than 30 days each. During the Trex earnings call on July 30 management said many of the production issues were behind them, and predicted a much improved second half in 2019.


Analysts now see Trex earnings rising 19% in the third quarter and 1% for the full year, with a 22% EPS gain in 2020.


Another key part of the [CAN SLIM formula is having institutional support](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). A number of funds given A+ ratings by IBD opened new positions in Trex stock in the most recent quarter. This includes the Fed Kaufmann Fund, the Victory RS Small Cap Growth Fund and the Baron Discovery Fund. It also boasts a strong [Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-tools/accumulationslhdistribution-(accslhdistm)-rating).

Stock Of The Day Makes Recycling Pay
------------------------------------


Trex's composite decking comprises 95% recycled materials including plastic bags, stretch wrap and postindustrial waste blended with material from flooring manufacturers and sawdust, Cline said. The exact recipe is a company secret.


Its manufacturing allows the company to use polyurethane that is considered otherwise undesirable because it contains certain colors. Cline estimates that Trex pays 10-20 cents per pound depending on the coloring. Bright reds and bold blues are undesirable, but are obscured in the final product due to manufacturing processes. Rivals often use polyurethane that costs 55-60 cents.


The resulting product is more durable than materials like wood, early-generation composite and PVC. Unlike wood, composite decking won't rot, split, swell, twist or fade. It doesn't splinter easily or require annual maintenance. It isn't subject to insect infestation and doesn't add to deforestation.


Trex said demand is robust. Alternative materials to wood decking are projected to experience above average annual gains in demand through 2020, according to a report by consulting firm Principia.


Housing- and construction-related stocks have been performing well in 2019. Trex is part of the Building-Construction Productions/Miscellaneous group, ranked No. 19 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD.

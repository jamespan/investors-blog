**Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Monday. The U.S. exploration and production company is moving toward a buy point ahead of earnings as many other shale plays and oil stocks fare well.




Austin, Texas-based Parsley Energy owns acreage in the prolific Permian Basin in West Texas. The company went public in 2014.


Parsley Energy Stock
--------------------


Shares rose 2.8% to close at 32.02 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). Parsley Energy stock has formed a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 33.35 entry point.


Parsley is ranked 11th in the Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group. Other notable members include recent IBD Stock of the Day **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), which is currently in buy range. **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) is in a cup base with a high-handle buy point of 138.35.


Oil stocks are holding up or moving higher Monday as U.S. crude futures reclaim $70 a barrel.


Parsley Energy Earnings
-----------------------


Parsley will report second-quarter results on Aug. 7. Zacks Investment analysts expect earnings of 41 cents per share, up 720% from 5 cents a year earlier. Revenue should double to $431 million.


**Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) report results Wednesday with EOG Resources earnings on tap Thursday.


Oil prices rebounded Monday over supply worries. Renewed Iran sanctions loom. Also, Saudi Arabia halted oil shipments through a key strait in the Red Sea after Houthi rebels attacked two ships. But trade tensions capped oil's gains.


Parsley Energy and other oil stocks are closely tied to crude futures, so investors need to watch for oil price swings.

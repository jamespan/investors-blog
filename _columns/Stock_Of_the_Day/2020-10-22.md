**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rose Thursday after beating earnings estimates late Wednesday and sticking to full-year delivery targets. The [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), Tesla stock is rebounding from key support and nearing a potential buy point.




Tesla Stock
-----------


The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock rose 0.75% to 425.78 in Thursday's [stock market trading](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). That was well off the intraday high of 445.23 and close to session lows.


For much of the day, Tesla looked resilient as the Nasdaq retreated and many growth names were getting roughed up. Tesla's weak close while the Nasdaq finished higher was less impressive, but don't get too hung up one day.


Tesla stock now has a proper handle in its consolidation, giving it a 466 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/).


Shares are also rebounding from their 10-week moving average. Aggressive investors could start or add to a position at 445.33, just above Thursday's intraday high.


[IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) is holding above the 50-day line and well above the 200-day line. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which gauges a stock's strength vs. the S&P 500, is just below recent record highs. The RS line is the blue line in the chart shown.



Tesla Earnings
--------------


Tesla earnings rose 105% to 76 cents a share, with revenue up 39% to $8.77 billion. Analysts had expected Tesla earnings of 55 cents a share on sales of $8.29 billion.


Automotive revenue climbed 42% to $7.6 billion, as revenue from regulatory credits nearly tripled to $397 million.


The amount earned from regulatory credits was far higher than expected. After its Q2 earnings in July, Tesla said credits in the second half of the year would be roughly to Q2's record $428 million. But Q3 alone nearly matched that.


Average selling price declined slightly due to product mix shift from Model S and Model X to the cheaper Model 3 and Model Y. Already this quarter, Tesla has slashed prices for the Model S, while cutting Model 3 prices in China yet again. Many expect Model 3 price cuts in the U.S.


Available cash at the end of the quarter was $14.5 billion, up by $5.9 billion from Q2.


In a conference call with analysts, CEO Elon Musk talked up improvements in production.


"We're getting way better at making cars," he said. "You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You'll see that even more in Berlin. Fundamental architecture of (Model) Y will be different in Berlin, fundamentally more efficient."

Tesla Guidance
--------------


Tesla said it still aims to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020, which would require a big jump from Q3's record 139,300. In a potential boost for Q4, [Tesla now plans to start exporting lower-cost, made-in-China Model 3s to Europe in October](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-shift-model3-europe-signals-upside-weakness/).


Model 3 production capacity in Shanghai has increased to 250,000 units a year, with a lower price enabled by lower-cost batteries and increased local procurement. As a result, Tesla recently added a third production shift to the Model 3 factory.


On Wednesday, Tesla said it recently increased Fremont capacity of Model 3/Model Y to 500,000 units a year. Production should reach full capacity toward year-end or early 2021, the company said.


However, sales fell in Europe even as overall electric car sales more than doubled, as competition heats up. China sales have flattened out in recent months, below production, as competition begins to intensify from the likes of **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)), **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) and **Xpeng Motors** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)).


Tesla Cybertruck 'Challenges'
-----------------------------


Tesla still says the Berlin and Austin plants will be finished in 2021. But Musk once again hinted that the Austin "Cybertruck" plant may produce the Cybertruck in 2021, noting there's no final design among various "challenges." The Austin plant will also make the Tesla Model Y.


That suggests that several electric pickups, including the Rivian RT1 and GM Hummer EV, will be released next year ahead of the Cybertruck.


**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) rose 2.3% to 36.60, hitting its best levels since the start of 2020. GM stock surged through a buy zone Wednesday after [unveiling the GM Hummer EV](https://www.investors.com/news/gm-stock-hummer-electric-truck-unveiling-rival-tesla-cybertruck/).


Overall EV competition is expected to soar in 2021, especially in Europe and China but also the U.S.

Tesla Full Self Driving
-----------------------


On Thursday, Elon Musk said the price of Tesla's "Full Self Driving" option by $2,000 on Monday, to $1,000. That follows Tuesday night's release of FSD Beta to a select number of customers.


But safety regulators say they will watch the latest Tesla offering "closely."


"NHTSA has been briefed on Tesla's new feature, which represents an expansion of its existing driver assistance system. The agency will monitor the new technology closely and will not hesitate to take action to protect (the) public against unreasonable risks to safety," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement.


Autonomous vehicle experts says the FSD and Autopilot names are misleading re misleading names for Level 2 driver-assist systems. Meanwhile, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-unit Waymo is offer driverless rides in the Phoenix area while Cruise, majority owned by GM, just got a permit for driverless testing in San Francisco.

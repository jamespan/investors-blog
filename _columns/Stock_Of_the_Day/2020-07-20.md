**Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the telehealth stock rebounds off its 10-week average amid new coronavirus-related opportunities.




In June, Masimo unveiled four new products, BTIG analyst Marie Thibault said in a recent report to clients. She expects at least one of those — a monitoring device called SafetyNet — to gain traction amid the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/).


SafetyNet is a remote-monitoring tool. Patients with suspected Covid-19 can wear it on their hand and wrist. It measures temperature, respiration rate and oxygen saturation, coupled with a patient surveillance platform.


"While we think material revenue or spend related to most of these products is likely at least a couple of years away, these new products do address large market opportunities that, taken together, may eventually become important growth drivers," Thibault said.

Telehealth Stocks Soar Amid Pandemic
------------------------------------


Telehealth stocks like **Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and **iRhythm Technologies** ([IRTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRTC)) are outperforming amid the coronavirus pandemic. Their products offer patients the means to stay home and avoid potential exposure to Covid-19.


Masimo is now moving deeper into that arena, Thibault said.


Thibault sees SafetyNet as the most impactful product over the near term. The wearable device can be used in the hospital setting and at home. The telehealth company says it has deployed the device in 80 hospitals to date. Nearly 800 more have expressed interest.


"It has been used to successfully triage patients who visit the hospital so that patients with a mild case of Covid don't need to be admitted for observation and monitoring," Masimo's vice president of business development and investor relations Eli Kammerman said in an email. "Instead, these patients can be monitored while at home."


Thibault notes that hospitals are incentivized to reduce readmissions of "frequent flyer" patients like those with congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. SafetyNet could remotely monitor these types of patients and intervene earlier to prevent hospital readmissions, she said.


"The value of remote monitoring is fairly easy to grasp during the pandemic since hospitals need to prioritize bed availability and triage patients," she said. "Remote monitoring should remain valuable long after the crisis passes, since it may help prevent avoidable hospital readmissions."


Other New Products Bolster Long Term
------------------------------------


Masimo's Kammerman also noted the company has launched a product called SafetyNet Open. The kit includes an oxygen level monitor, body temperature patch and a proximity sensor. It allows businesses, governments and academic institutions to "provide tracking and traceability for any staff exposed to Covid cases in the work environment," he said.


Also last month, the telehealth company announced Masimo Sleep, an at-home device to measure a person's sleep quality. Further, Masimo nabbed U.S. clearance of Centroid, a wearable respiration rate sensor. It also unveiled an opioid withdrawal solution called Bridge.


Masimo Sleep likely fits into the box of personal health. The device uses a 10-day sensor to monitor and analyze oxygen levels, heart rate and respiration rate to help users understand their sleep quality. Its sales will be driven by online ordering and direct-to-consumer advertising, Thibault said.


But Centroid and Bridge likely dovetail well with Masimo's core hospital business.


Centroid has Food and Drug Administration clearance as a wireless sensor worn on the chest to help prevent pressure ulcers, detect falls and provide continuous respiration rate, she said. It's currently in a limited release in some hospitals and long-term care facilities.


Eventually, it could roll out to monitor the 2.5 million U.S. patients affected by pressure ulcers.


Bridge is a wearable neurotransmitter than aims to curb the symptoms of opioid withdrawal.


"Masimo would likely target opioid rehabilitation/detox centers," Thibault said. "We see this as complementary to Masimo's efforts in trying to prevent deaths from opioid-induced respiratory depression."


Highly Rated Medical Stock
--------------------------


Thibault kept her neutral rating on Masimo stock based on its valuation.


In the second quarter, analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Masimo to report adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share on $289 million in sales. On a year-over-year basis, Masimo earnings would rise 2.6% and sales would pop nearly 26%.


Long term, Thibault notes Masimo has reaffirmed its guidance for 8%-10% core business revenue growth and 12%-15% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Hospital automation, efforts to reduce symptoms in the opioid patient population and the newest products are additive to that, she said.


"This gives Masimo an extra cushion that could allow the company to continue outpacing investor expectations," she said.


Masimo stock is also highly rated with an Investor's Business Daily [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 95. The Composite Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's technical and fundamental growth measures. This puts the telehealth stock in the top 5% of all stocks regardless industry group.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Masimo stock climbed 5.1% to 246.81.


Shares of the telehealth stock are staring down a traditional [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 258.10 out of a consolidation. There's also an early entry at 241.24 above short-term resistance, confirming a rebound from the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). Masimo stock went above that early entry in Monday's session.


Notably, the telehealth stock is also an IBD [Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen).

**PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The digital payment processor has broken out, joining many of its peers, but may offer a better buying oppounity. Its relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign.




PayPal stock cleared a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 84.09 entry point on Monday. But volume was low. Investors could look for a more powerful move above the left side of its base, offering an 86.42 entry.


Shares rose 0.6% to 85.05 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is confirming the stock's breakout.



PayPal Strong Fundamentals
--------------------------


Earnings and sales recently snapped a string of accelerating growth, but remain robust. PayPal stock has a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). This means that the company is now outperforming 97% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical terms.


PayPal is ranked No.3 in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor group. Several payment stocks have broken out in recent weeks. **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which leads the group, is slightly extended from a buy range. So is **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and previous [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day-green-dot-tight-pattern-payment-stocks/) **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)).


PayPal's Venmo app is popular among millennials but faces rivals like Square's Cash App and Zelle, which is owned by big banks including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Capital One** ([COF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COF)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)).


PayPal isn't standing still. Last week, it agreed to buy Jetlore, an artificial-intelligence startup. Harshal Deo, vice president of commerce solutions, said that Jetlore will "enhance and accelerate" PayPal's products.


Last month, PayPal bought iZettle, a European rival to Square.


**Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)), Monday's IBD Stock of the Day, rose 2.5% to 78.97 Tuesday, retaking a 77.69 buy point.

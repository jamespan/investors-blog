**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), IBD's [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), broke out in dramatic fashion Thursday after the chain beat fourth-quarter forecasts and hiked its dividend despite a delivery war raging across the restaurant industry. Domino's Pizza stock, now on the [IBD's Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), shot up 25%.




The strong earnings come amid a broader debate about how to survive in a restaurant landscape where food delivery is more widely available than ever.


Domino's delivery business has gotten pinched as third-party deliverers like **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), DoorDash, Postmates and Uber Eats give other restaurants a piece of the delivery pie long hoarded by pizza company.


But Domino's management on Thursday said that comparable sales for delivery were positive in Q4 and better than in the prior quarter.


Meanwhile, rival deliverers' onslaught of advertising and incentives showed signs of easing, CEO Ritch Allison said, though he warned of "continued headwinds in delivery" and difficulty in forecasting.


"We don't know how these folks are gonna behave," he said on Domino's earnings conference call. In October, he predicted a "significant shakeout" among the food delivery industry.


And while on Thursday he compared its third-party competitors to a circular firing squad with no choice but to keep advertising, he said Domino's "might get hit by a few stray bullets along the way."


As for the stores themselves, CFO Jeff Lawrence on Thursday said the company's takeout business was "on fire." More than half of them in the U.S. are using GPS technology, helping to cut back on the three to six months' time it normally takes for a driver to learn a route.


As technology shapes competition in delivery, Allison said the company would continue to find ways to strengthen its carryout business. And he said that in areas where wages are rising, restaurants prioritizing delivery over drive-thru or takeout were essentially steering customers to a higher-cost business. Carryout, in those cases, he said, becomes the profit engine.

Domino's Pizza Stock
--------------------


Shares jumped 25.6% to close at 373.16 on the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), hitting a record high. That's well above a 299.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/). But in a breakaway gap-up, investors could treat today's opening price of 362.03 as a valid entry for [Domino's Pizza stock](https://www.investors.com/research/dominos-stock-buy-now/). Shares have a 67 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), and the [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), a gauge of profit growth, is a strong 93. The relative strength line also hit a new record high.


The Domino's earnings report and stock action suggest DPZ stock could be becoming a Long-Term Leader once again. Domino's Pizza stock had a huge 10-year run ending in August 2018, but is moving out of 16-month consolidation.


Meanwhile, rival **Papa John's** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) rose 2.85% Thursday, and Pizza Hut parent **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) fell 1.25% after warning in a filing that Pizza Hut sales may be hurt by lower ad spending and the closing of some weaker locations, while wages costs are also rising.


Domino's Pizza Earnings
-----------------------


The chain earned $3.13 per share, up 19%. That was better than estimates for $2.93, according to Zacks. Revenue increased 6% to $1.15 billion. The result was above forecasts for $1.12 billion.


U.S. same-store sales grew 3.4%, compared to Consensus Metrix's forecast a 2.1% same-store sales gain domestically. International same-store sales rose 1.7%, excluding currency moves, compared to expectations for 2% increase.


Domino's backed its 2 to 3 year outlook of 7%-10% global retail sales growth, 2%-5% U.S. same-store sales growth, and 1%-4% international sales growth.


The company also hiked its dividend 20% to 78 cents.


'Shakeout' Ahead?
-----------------


Third-party deliverers have said customers care more about ordering from the restaurants they want, rather than the platforms offering the access. Commitment to one app over another is scarce. Some of those companies, at least, have lost money.


Delivery and service fees — along with higher menu prices some restaurants charge for delivery — can pile up quickly for a single customer ordering a single sandwich. Third-party deliverers often cut delivery fees to draw in new diners. But Domino's argues that customers will bail once they inevitably pull back on incentives as their backers prioritize profit.


"If you offer to mow my lawn for free, I'm gonna say yes," Allison said on the call in October. "When you come and charge me for it, I might just go out there and push the mower around myself."


'Fortressing'
-------------


Merger speculation, in one way or another, persists among Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Postmates. But Domino's has said it's not interested in working with a third-party deliver in the U.S.


Domino's has argued that its "fortressing" strategy — in which it clusters stores together in redrawn delivery areas — will lead it through the fray by speeding up delivery times. However, the stores' closer proximity risks cannibalizing sales.


The company and some analysts say its entrenched network of stores, where food-prep protocols are nailed down and often repeated, make for more predictable operations, efficient order turnaround and stable profit. Rivals, whose drivers run orders from all kind of restaurants, don't always have that same kind of consistency.


On Thursday, Allison said Domino's would continue to "fortress" more markets this year. The practice, he said, would lower delivery costs. Fortressed stores tended to cut delivery times by around two to three minutes, he said.

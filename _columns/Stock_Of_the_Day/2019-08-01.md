NeoGenomics stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cancer-testing outlet breaks out on a never-higher relative strength line.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), NeoGenomics [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) popped 6.1% to close at 25.85. Shares easily cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 24.94. This followed the cancer-testing company's third consecutive quarter in which both sales and earnings have increased by double-digit percentages.


William Blair analyst Brian Weinstein says **NeoGenomics** ([NEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEO)) beat expectations "on most every metric we track." This allowed the [cancer-testing company](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/cancer-testing-neogenomics-stock-leads-diagnostics-companies/) to raise its 2019 sales outlook for the second time this year. Now, NeoGenomics expects $388 million to $402 million in sales.


He noted, "upside to estimates in both clinical and pharma services businesses, a positive update on Genoptix integration, investments being made to support future growth and an outlook that we believe still leaves room for upside to develop in the second half."

NeoGenomics Earnings, Sales Top Estimates
-----------------------------------------


During the [second quarter, NeoGenomics earnings](https://neogenomics.com/sites/default/files/Press-Release/2019-07-30_Q22019.pdf) popped 40% to 7 cents per share, minus some items. That beat estimates by a penny, William Blair's Weinstein said in a report to clients. Sales rose 50% to $101.7 million, above forecasts for $96.8 million.


NeoGenomics sales growth accelerated for four consecutive quarters ending in the first quarter, until second-quarter revenue came in at a slightly slower pace. That follows the cancer-testing company's $125 million acquisition of Genoptix, which closed in December. Earnings growth has been in the double digits for three straight quarters now.


Both metrics are now in line with [CAN SLIM rules of investing,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/) which advises investors to seek stocks that show at least 25% sales and earnings growth each quarter.


Cancer-Testing Company Set For Growth
-------------------------------------


William Blair's Weinstein noted the sales beat was broad. Clinical testing revenue increased 49% to $89 million, above estimates for $86.3 million. Meanwhile, test volume ramped up 34% and was 14,000 ahead of forecasts, Weinstein said.


Pharma services revenue of $12.7 million increased 55% and topped projections for $10.5 million.


The only "blip" stemmed from revenue per test in the clinical testing segment, Weinstein said. The cancer-testing company reported a $13 sequential decline in revenue per test due to renegotiated managed care contracts to include Genoptix and integration activities.



He cautioned investors against "missing the forest for the trees by nitpicking about these kinds of one-time off dynamics that are not germane to the long-term story."


"Rather, we believe the company continues to be in very good shape and this appears to us to be a strong quarter punctuated with positive commentary that continues to support our overall thesis on the stock," Weinstein said.


NeoGenomics Stock Shows Bullish Signals
---------------------------------------


Weinstein kept his outperform rating on NeoGenomics stock.


In addition to its breakout, NeoGenomics stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is floating around record highs. This is a bullish sign when combined with a breakout. Further, the RS line has been strong since late December.


NeoGenomics stock has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The CR ranks several technical and fundamental metrics. This puts NeoGenomics stock in the top 4% of all stocks in terms of key growth measures.


Shares of the cancer-testing company also have a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 95. The RS Rating is a 1-99 score of a stock's 12-month performance. So NeoGenomics stock ranks in the top 5% of all stocks regardless of industry group.


Other cancer-testing outlets also are performing well this year. **Guardant Health** ([GH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GH)) stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) formation at a 94.54 entry on July 15. Shares are now in buy range. Earlier this week, **Exact Sciences** ([EXAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXAS)) [announced it would buy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceutical-companies-pfizer-upjohn-combine-mylan-generic-drugs/) **Genomic Health** ([GHDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GHDX)) for $2.8 billion in cash and stock.

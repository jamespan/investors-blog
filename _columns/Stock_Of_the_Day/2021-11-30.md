**Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the emergence of the Covid variant, omicron, has highlighted life sciences companies and DHR stock.




Last week, the World Health Organization deemed omicron a variant of concern. Since then, biotech and pharma companies have been scrambling to determine whether omicron's numerous mutations — many centered on the important spike protein in the coronavirus — will undo the effectiveness of their products.


But this could prove to be a boon for life science companies. Danaher makes tools necessary to develop drugs, including filtration, separation and purification technologies. It also has a hand in Covid testing, reporting $600 million in third-quarter sales, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note.


In afternoon trading on [today's stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), DHR stock was slightly down at 325.72.

DHR Stock: How Covid Plays Into Sales
-------------------------------------


Danaher is in a strong position amid the pandemic. During the third quarter, Covid-related revenue was $1.1 billion, Kumar said. That helped overall sales grow 20.5% organically and beat forecasts.


Further, Danaher increased its order backlog for contributions from vaccine makers to $2 billion exiting fiscal year 2022. Previously, the company guided to $1.5 billion in vaccine contribution to revenue. It also reiterated expectations for $45 million in Covid testing sales in fiscal year 2022.


But those projections could change if vaccines from [**Pfizer**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/) ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) with **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), [**Moderna**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/) ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and [**Johnson & Johnson**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/) ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) no longer fend off Covid due to omicron. BioNTech is testing its current shot against omicron, while Moderna is working on a variant-specific vaccine.


Investors piled into DHR stock on Friday, sending shares up nearly 3%. That trailed double-digit jumps for vaccine stocks, however. On Monday, Danaher shares inched a fraction higher. Shares are forming a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 334.06, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).



Representatives of Danaher didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.


Highly Rated Medical Stock
--------------------------


DHR stock is among the top-rated stocks on [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital). It has a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. That puts shares in the leading 3% of all stocks in terms of fundamental and technical measures.


Shares also have a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 88. This means DHR stock ranks in the top 12% of all stocks in terms of 12-month performance.

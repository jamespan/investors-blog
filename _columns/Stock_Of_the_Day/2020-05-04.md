Bandwidth on April 30 reported first-quarter earnings, with a strong beat on the top and bottom lines. Even so, some analysts are cautious amid highly competitive pricing and low gross margins for a quasi-software company.


Bandwidth Stock: Web Giants Top Customers
-----------------------------------------


Bandwidth customers include **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google, **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Skype, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) and **Slack Technologies** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)). Those customers have experienced a jump in demand for cloud-based conferencing services as companies instruct employees to work from home.


Bandwidth's application programming interface, or API, enables customers to embed voice functions into conferencing platforms. Also, Bandwidth provides network services. It operates a nationwide internet network that handles voice calls and 911 emergency calling.


"The company's top five meeting-solutions customers experienced an aggregate 66% increase in usage in March, compared to the first two months of the quarter, and the top 10 (unified communications) customers experienced an aggregate 45% increase over the same period," Dougherty & Co. analyst Catharine Trebnick said in a report to clients.


She added: "We believe Bandwidth is one company investors can look to that will draft off work-from-home dynamics for the near to long term."


Bandwidth reported first-quarter adjusted profit of 4 cents, up 133% from a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue jumped 29% to $68.5 million.


In addition, the company launched its initial public offering in November 2017. The IPO raised $80 million, with shares priced at 20. In early 2020, the company raised $350 million in a convertible debt offering.


Strong Balance Sheet A Plus Amid Covid-19 Emergency
---------------------------------------------------


Bandwidth ended the March quarter with $517.9 million cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Chief Executive David Morken said on Bandwidth's earnings call with analysts that it's in no rush to make acquisitions.


"Right now we're all watching the fluidity and the uncertainty and hoping that things coalesce around a bright future, and a recovery that's not shaped like an L," Morken said. "And we're very grateful that we have the cash balance that we do. It represents optionality."


He added: "We don't think there's any urgency; it's not burning a hole in our pocket."


Bandwidth operates in a highly competitive market, analysts say. Rivals include **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Vonage**'s ([VG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VG)) Nexmo.


"Bandwidth's lack of a global footprint is a concern," noted Trebnick.


Further, Bandwidth's ability to continue improving profitability as business ramps up is another issue.


Bandwidth Stock: Pricing Highly Competitive?
--------------------------------------------


In an email, Trebnick noted that "over the past six quarters, Bandwidth gross margins have ranged from 48.2% to 50.6%."


Bandwidth didn't respond by publishing time to an email asking about its competitive environment.


At Morgan Stanley, analyst Meta Marshall has an equal-weight rating on Bandwidth stock.


"While we think that BAND remains a name with excellent secular tailwinds, we tend to think investors miss that many of their customers multi-source, and pricing can be competitive," Marshall said in her note to clients.


One risk for Bandwidth stock is that small business customers could close amid the coronavirus emergency, Marshall added. Another worry is that larger businesses could use Bandwidth's network services less as the economy slows down.

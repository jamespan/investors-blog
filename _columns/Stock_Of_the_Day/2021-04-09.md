'As Good As It's Ever Been'
---------------------------


Floor & Decor stock rose after fourth-quarter sales, reported in February, jumped 37.3%. Earnings per share rose 80.8%. The company's fourth-quarter same-store sales jumped 21.6%, with strong gains across all its product categories.


The chain is planning new store openings, with many in new markets like the Northeast and West Coast. The chain is trying to boost its online ordering, delivery and pickup business, and invest in the segment that serves professional customers like contractors and installers.


When asked in February about trends in the home improvement industry, management said the backdrop was still strong.


"I think the backdrop's as good as it's ever been," CFO Trevor Lang said on the company's earnings conference call. He added that "people are spending more time in their home. They're having to repurpose their home. It's work. It's play. It's everything. It's exercise."


However, he said, more people could start traveling again and take in other forms of entertainment as vaccines increase and the economy reopens. Some of the spending directed toward them could go back to other leisure activities.

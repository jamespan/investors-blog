TJX is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) for Monday as shares climbed in a buy zone on the back of its earnings last week. Meanwhile, other retailers continue to report results as the holiday shopping season gets underway.




**TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) on Nov. 20 reported about an 11% increase in Q3 2025 earnings to $1.14 per share, which beat FactSet estimates for $1.09 per share. Net sales increased 6% to $14.06 billion, also topping expectations for $13.95 billion.


Consolidated comparable sales for the quarter rose 3% to match analyst views. Same store sales for TJX International increased 7%.


Net sales for Marmaxx, which includes TJ Maxx and Marshalls, rose 4% to $8.44 billion. HomeGoods sales rose 7% while TJX Canada sales rose 5%. International sales for TJX, including Europe and Australia, popped 16% to nearly $1.9 billion.


"Across the company, customer transactions drove our comp sales increases, which tells us that our values and treasure-hunt shopping experience are appealing to a wide range of customers," CEO Ernie Herrman said in the earnings release.


TJX lifted its full-year earnings outlook to range from $4.15 to $4.17 per share, up from its prior guidance for $4.09 to $4.13 per share. However, the updated guidance still fell short of FactSet estimates for $4.19 per share.


TJX maintained its comparable sales forecast for 3% growth.


The company expects its Q4 earnings to range from $1.12 to $1.14 per share, also below analyst expectations for $1.16 per share.


Despite the guidance miss, a number of firms modestly raised price targets on TJX stock after results.


Baird on Thursday raised its price target by $5 to 133 and kept an outperform rating on shares, noting that TJX continues to demonstrate strong merchant execution and the appeal of value. Evercore ISI said that TJX's Q4 is off to a "strong" start, which should override any concerns about Q3 results. The firm raised its price target on TJX by $4 to 142 and maintained its outperform rating. Evercore also noted that it doesn't expect other retailers reporting before Black Friday to reflect that same strength.


TD Cowen also raised its price target for TJX stock on Monday by $2 to 132 and kept a buy rating on the shares.


Retail Earnings
---------------


Among other retailers, **Bath & Body Works** ([BBWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBWI)) popped more than 14% Monday on its earnings beat. **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) retreated nearly 4% after delaying its quarterly report. The legacy department giant announced it is conducting an internal investigation after discovering an employee "intentionally" hid $132 million to $154 million in delivery expenses dating back to Q4 2021.


**Burlington** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) both report on Tuesday.


FactSet expects Burlington to report a 58% increase in earnings to $1.55 per share on about 12% revenue growth to $2.55 billion. Burling stock is at the top of a buy range following a breakout on Friday.


Analysts see Kohl's earnings nearly halving to 28 cents per share while revenue slides more than 5% to $3.64 billion.

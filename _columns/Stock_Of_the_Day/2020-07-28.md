Recent IPO **Azek Company** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) Tuesday amid a strong housing market and desire for outdoor space during the coronavirus pandemic. Azek stock is breaking out




Mortgage rates are at record lows during Covid-19. With more people working from home or working from anywhere really, apartment renters looking for more space or cheaper living options are in the market for a new home, boosting housing stocks.


An uptick in home buying interest is good news for Azek. The Chicago-based company offers non-wood decking, trim and other outdoor supplies from recycled material. The desire for outdoor space with a patio or deck is especially desirable as restaurants, pools and gyms remain closed.


The IPO stock made its market debut on June 12 at 23 per share. Azek stock has a 92 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which combines five other IBD stock ratings, out of a best possible 99. Peers in the housing supply space include fake-wood decking specialist **Trex Company** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)).

Azek Stock
----------


Shares fell 0.5% to 34 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), reversing from a record 35.81 intraday as the broader market faded into the close. Azek stock is still in buy range after breaking out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) with a 33.85 entry point on Monday, according to [MarketSmith analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The 5% chase zone runs to 35.54.


The stock is actionable, even if it extends slightly above buy range. But investors should be cautious as IPO bases can be erratic and make major moves up or down. Investors should be mindful of the amount of Azek stock purchased as it could quickly fall below the buy point, and more than the usual 7% to 8% loss that triggers an automatic sell.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Azek stock is at a record high, a bullish sign. The RS, the blue line in the chart below, tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



Trex stock fell 3% to 134.85. Clearing a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) by mid-July, Trex stock is still in range from a 132.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Trex earnings are due next week.


Azek will report fiscal third-quarter results before the market opens on Aug. 13, its first earnings report since the IPO. Analysts expect Azek earnings of 11 cents per share on revenue of $213.12 million, down from 16 cents and $221.3 million a year earlier.

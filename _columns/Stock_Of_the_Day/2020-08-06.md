**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as shares of the social media giant moved through a buy zone Thursday. That follows a gap-up in Facebook stock from its recent quarterly earnings report.




Facebook reported [quarterly earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-second-quarter-earnings/) July 30. The next day, shares surged 8%, shooting above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Facebook stock jumped 6.5% to close at 265.28 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). As a result, it hurdled above Friday's earnings gap, establishing a buy point of 252.37. The buy zone had extended to 264.88. The stop-loss sell point is 247.43.


The company's second-quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates, coming at a time when the social media giant is under intense scrutiny for its business practices.

Arts and crafts retailer **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), an e-commerce company that is standing out in a large and underpenetrated market.




Etsy stock, up 41% this year, has formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a buy point of 73.44.  The stock climbed 2.7% to close at 67.85 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The Etsy website sells custom made handcrafted goods, vintage items and other arts and crafts, including apparel. The company currently is in six geographic markets: The U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Canada and Australia. It has 39 million active buyers and 2 million active sellers.


Etsy held its initial public offering in April 2015, pricing shares at 16. The stock popped 72% on its first day.

Etsy Stock Gets Buy Rating
--------------------------


Canaccord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps recently initiated coverage on Etsy with a buy rating and price target of 85. She thinks the addressable market for Etsy is $100 billion, and growing to $170 billion in five years.


"Over the last couple years, new management has made noticeable improvements to both the seller and buyer experiences," Ripps wrote in her note to clients. "The net result should be better marketing efficiency, higher customer lifetime values, and additional revenue streams."


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-starbucks-corp-sbux.aspx) shows that Etsy has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 97 out of a best-possible 99, meaning the stock currently tops 97% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 97, which also reflects strong [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) performance.


One weak spot is the company's EPS Rating of 67, which tracks quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth. Look for that to improve to 80 or better to show it's in the top 20% of all stocks.


The company ranks third among its peers in IBD's Retail/Internet industry group, behind **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). It's followed by **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).


Etsy stock recently broke above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) moving average, and is getting support at the [10-week average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Both are positive indicators but trading volume has been lighter than desired.


Risky Buy Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------


It's important to note that Etsy will announce first-quarter results on May 8, after the market close. It's always risky to buy a stock when the earnings report is near. Stocks sometimes make big moves, up or down, on earnings, depending on how the numbers compare to Wall Street expectations.


But for the bold investor with conviction, IBD has an [options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/) to limit risk around earnings.


Etsy reported [fourth-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/etsy-earnings-etsy-stock-04-2018/) after the close on Feb. 25 that topped analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines. Etsy revenue soared 44% to $200 million. The stock jumped 16% the following day.


Before forming its current flat base, though, Etsy stock went through two corrections that were choppy and deeper than what is typically considered healthy. It's November earnings report was followed by a quick gap up and then a rapid reversal. The current stock action in the flat base is less wild.


Institutional investor action in the first quarter shows accumulation, a positive sign. Its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Accumulation%2fDistribution+(Acc%2fDis)+Rating&termid=1) of B- shows moderate buying over sellers by over the last 13 weeks.

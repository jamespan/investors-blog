**Livongo Health** ([LVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVGO)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the digital health outlet pre-announced better-than-expected quarterly sales. In response, LVGO stock broke out.




For the first quarter ended March 31, [Livongo now expects](https://ir.livongo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/livongo-announces-preliminary-first-quarter-2020-revenue-exceeds) $65.5 million to $66.5 million in sales. That beat the company's own earlier guidance for $60 million to $62 million, and the average estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $62 million.


The digital health company provides remote monitoring and telehealth options for people with chronic health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, weight management and behavior health. Livongo is benefiting from a push to stay home amid the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close said in a recent note to clients. He has a buy rating and 46 price target on LVGO stock.


"What has become increasingly clear is the value proposition of telehealth and remote monitoring in providing effective triage, care and a solution to mitigate the impact of a pandemic like Covid-19," he said. "While telehealth is more episodic, remote monitoring can enable the early detection of potential health issues and focus attention to individuals most at risk."

LVGO Stock Tops Two Buy Points
------------------------------


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), LVGO [stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) jumped 10.2% to close at 33.16. The medical stock topped two [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in early action. First, shares of LVGO stock surged above a buy point at 30.29 out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). Shares also rose above an alternative entry at 31.92.


KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker noted the pre-announcement is materially above the company's prior outlook. Now, Livongo expects 104%-107% year-over-year sales growth. That growth is all organic, and not due to an acquisition, he said in his report to clients.


"Telehealth/virtual care has become highly topical for employers and health plans during the Covid-19 outbreak," Hooker said. "The Covid-19 outbreak is particularly threatening for Americans with chronic conditions."


A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report indicated about 78% of Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care also had at least one preexisting health condition. Livongo's suite of digital health products, including a telehealth offering, can help patients avoid viral exposure by staying home.


Telehealth In The Spotlight
---------------------------


Shares of LVGO stock went public at 28 in mid-2019.


Livongo is among a small cadre of companies working in telehealth, a new field that connects patients with medical professionals virtually. In Livongo's case, the company provides remote monitoring tech for patients with chronic conditions.


Typically, a diabetic patient might see a doctor several times a year, Livongo Chief Financial Officer Lee Shapiro told Investor's Business Daily. But spikes in blood sugar can happen rapidly. Without a doctor on hand to dispense medical advice, it can be difficult to determine what happened and how to fix it.


Enter Livongo.


Livongo has several technology agreements in place that help monitor patients remotely. For example, another company called **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) makes body-worn continuous glucose monitors to track blood sugar. Under a deal with Dexcom, readings for Livongo patients are sent to a cloud.


An algorithm analyzes those readings, putting them in line with what's normal for that patient, Shapiro said. In the case of an abnormal reading, Livongo's system sends a message via text, an app or email letting a patient know how to make health improvements.


How Livongo Reduces Doctor Visits
---------------------------------


Livongo had more than 223,000 active members as of the end of 2019.


The company aims to reduce doctor visits by offering patients tailored advice at the time they need it.


Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the health care system was already moving in that direction, CFO Shapiro said. But the onset of Covid-19 has hastened the transition, he said. That's because it's likely patients with chronic conditions will have more severe symptoms of the virus.


"I think there will be a lot of things that change in our world because of the pandemic," he said. "Certainly the utilization of digital health solutions, remote monitoring and using a vehicle like ours to connect individuals through data as well as the opportunity to speak to someone about your condition will continue to be utilized as we start to manage more and more conditions remotely."


Announcement A Rarity Amid Covid-19
-----------------------------------


The positive pre-announcement is "rare event in this difficult environment," LVGO stock analyst Anne Samuel of JPMorgan said in a note. A number of medical companies have suspended or trimmed their outlooks for the first quarter amid pandemic-related uncertainty.


But Livongo is experiencing better-than-expected enrollment across its business. Livongo's clients are employers and health plans. Those entities offer the Livongo service to patients with qualifying chronic conditions. And Livongo is only paid for the patients who participate, CFO Shapiro said.


During the first quarter, Livongo had more than 620 clients launches. Further, patient enrollment was ahead of estimates, JPMorgan's Samuel said.



Livongo recently won a major deal for its digital behavioral health platform with Kaiser Permanente, Canaccord's Hooker said. Kaiser has more than 12 million health plan members, he noted.


Beating The Unemployment Hurdle
-------------------------------


Unemployment, however, could be a challenge for LVGO stock, said JPMorgan's Samuel. She doesn't expect employers to terminate contacts with Livongo given its proven return on investment. But layoffs could increase churn in the model, she said, and have an impact on revenue.


Still, Samuel kept her overweight rating on LVGO stock. She also raised her price target by 1 to 36.


Canaccord's Close notes that the health outlet is seeing increased interest from government organizations, health plans and labor unions.


"We believe that Livongo's products, which help individuals effectively manage chronic conditions, could see accelerated adoption amid Covid-19," he said. "Increased awareness and acceptance of virtual-care offerings to efficiently address people's health care needs should benefit the company in the long term."


LVGO Stock Is Highly Rated
--------------------------


Shares of LVGO stock have a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) of 97 out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating is a 1-99 measure of a company's technical and fundamental growth metrics. So, LVGO stock ranks in the top 3% of all stocks on that measure.


The health stock also has a strong [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 93 out of 99. This puts LVGO stock's 12-month performance in the top 7% of all stocks.


Although shares have a middling [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) of 64, analysts polled by Zacks expect Livongo to post an annual profit in 2021. The EPS Rating tracks a stock's recent profitability.

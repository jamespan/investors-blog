The company plans to host an investor day April 6, where updated long-term guidance could be a catalyst for AMAT stock.

In addition, AMAT stock is finding support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). If it can get above last week's high, then 117.95 would be an early entry.


AMAT Stock: Financial Targets To Be Updated At Investor Day
-----------------------------------------------------------


At its April 6 investor day, Applied Materials plans to discuss "its longer-term market outlook, opportunities, strategies, product and technology roadmaps, and financial targets."


Demand for chips for cloud-computing data centers, 5G wireless handsets and automobiles has been driving sales of its equipment. Demand for flat-panel display manufacturing gear, however, has been weak.


In its first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, AMAT stock reported sales of $5.16 billion, up 24% from a year earlier. Earnings rose 42% to $1.39 per share.


For the April quarter, Applied Materials expects to earn an adjusted $1.50 a share, up 69%, on sales of $5.39 billion, up 36%.


On its first-quarter earnings call, Applied Materials said it expects the worldwide wafer fab equipment market to grow above 18% to around $70 billion in 2021. That market rose 16% to $60 billion in 2020.


Applied Materials: Buyback A Possible Catalyst?
-----------------------------------------------


"AMAT expects to continue to gain share in 2021 supported by new innovative products and their unique product breadth," AMAT stock analyst Vivek Arya from Bank of America said in a recent note to clients.


Applied Materials' customers include foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), which is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Leaderboard is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.


"Considering that the company will be generating significant cash flow on expanding margins, the potential for share count reduction from buybacks is yet another lever for upside," RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said in his report to clients.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx), AMAT stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 84 out of a possible 99. The best stocks own ratings above 80.


Further, AMAT stock holds an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/)of B-plus.


AMAT Stock: Will U.S. Government Subsidize Chip Manufacturing?
--------------------------------------------------------------


The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ means heavy institutional buying, while E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group [ranks No. 25 out of 197 groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-12-2021/) tracked. Choosing highly rated stocks from leading industry groups in a confirmed stock market uptrend generally increases your chances of making profits in growth stocks.


One plus for AMT stock and other semiconductor manufacturing gear makers is that memory-chip sales rebounded in late 2020. Meanwhile, capacity constraints at foundries such as Taiwan Semi have resulted in a chip shortage in the automotive industry.


The shortage could prompt the U.S. government to provide subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing, thus affecting AMAT stock.

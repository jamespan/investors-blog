**Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as Uber stock consolidates around a potential flat base chart pattern. Shares of the ride-hailing player have gained nearly 30% so far this year, helped by strong earnings and plans for the company's first-ever stock buyback.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?), Uber stock slipped a fraction to close at 80.23.. Shares of the San Francisco-based company gapped up about 15% on Feb. 14, after Uber announced plans for its first-ever buyback. Since then, Uber stock has consolidated near a 52-week high of 82.14. Over the past 12 months, Uber shares have surged more than 150%.


Uber swung to a profit last year, with earnings of 87 cents per share for its fiscal year ending with December 2023. Analysts project the ride-hailing and food-delivery firm will grow earnings 43% this year, to $1.24 per share, according to FactSet.


Uber Stock Jumps After Buyback
------------------------------


Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that Uber was planning a buyback last fall. The company made it official ahead of its Feb. 14 virtual investor day. Uber said its board has approved the repurchase of up to $7 billion in stock.


During its virtual investor event that same day, Uber offered new projections for the next three years. Over that period, Uber projects annual gross bookings growth in the mid- to high-teens. Gross bookings are the total dollar value of fares charged for transportation, food delivery and other services.


Further, the company said it expects adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization — to grow in the "high 30s to 40%" annually over the next three years, as the company described in a regulatory filing.


Following the report, JPMorgan maintained a positive overweight rating for Uber stock and upped its target price to 95 from 84.


"We continue to believe that Uber's scale and platform advantages will help drive large, sustainable growth opportunities across Mobility and Delivery, while generating strong EBITDA and free cash flow," JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a Feb. 14 client note.

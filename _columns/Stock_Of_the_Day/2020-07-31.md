Pinterest Stock Up 74% This Year
--------------------------------


The company held its initial public offering in April 2019, pricing shares at 19. Its record high is 36.83, reached in August. For the year, Pinterest stock is up about 74%.


Like most every other company, Pinterest has had to maneuver through the difficult business environment caused by the coronavirus. The virus has had a big impact on internet companies highly dependent on advertising, as is the case with Pinterest. That explains why revenue in the quarter increased just 4% from the year-ago period.


Since coming public, Pinterest has posted steady double-digit growth for years. However, as consumers seek shelter due to Covid-19, they are look for things to do in their spare time. That explains why the company reported user growth well above estimates.


The company ended the quarter with 416 million monthly active users, up 39% from the year-ago period and significantly above analyst estimates of 379 million.


"We are encouraged by the performance of our business," the company said in a written statement Friday. "But a tremendous amount of uncertainty remains given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and other factors."


Pinterest did not provide formal guidance for the third quarter or year. However, it noted the revenue growth in July was tracking about 50% above the same month a year ago. It anticipates third-quarter revenue growth at about 30%.


High Levels Of Engagement
-------------------------


"The people who began using Pinterest during Covid-19 continued to have high levels of engagement even after shelter-in-place restrictions were eased," the company said in its [shareholder letter](https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Pinterest-Q220-Shareholder-Letter-(2).pdf). "In fact, new users in the Covid-19 cohort are currently more engaged than a cohort of new users during the same period last year."


Pinterest stock is trading well above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and 200 day moving averages.


The IBD [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-pinterest-inc-cl-a-pins.aspx) shows that Pinterest currently has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 76 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Pinterest stock currently outperforms 76% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria. That number is likely to rise based on today's stock performance.


Importantly, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is currently soaring, now at a level it was last August when Pinterest stock hit its record high. The relative strength line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.

Auto parts stock **Dorman Products** ([DORM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DORM)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), with the auto and truck parts supplier continuing to hold up well in a tough market as investors tune in to its accelerating growth.







Dorman Products supplies replacement parts and fasteners for passenger cars and light trucks mainly. This segment of the automotive aftermarket generated roughly $286.9 billion in industry sales in 2017.


Customers include both individuals, purchasing auto parts for "do-it-yourself" repairs on their own vehicles, and professional installers, including auto repair shops and dealerships.


Why Dorman Products Stock Is Defensive
--------------------------------------


Auto parts companies tend to be defensive plays. As fears of an economic slowdown ramp up, consumers are seen fixing up their existing cars rather than buying new cars.


In addition, China announced six days ago that it will halt punitive tariffs on U.S. cars and auto parts starting Jan. 1, buoying auto parts stocks.


Dorman Products stock rose 1.4% to 83.91 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), closing back above an 83.52 buy point it first cleared about a month ago.


That's despite the major stock market averages hitting fresh 52-week lows, with the Nasdaq composite entering bear market territory.


Shares have been testing short-term support at [the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), but their relative strength line bolted into new high ground Thursday, a bullish sign. Helped by strong earnings, Dorman Products stock soared 33% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 lost roughly 7% over the same period.


Two caveats to bear in mind:


1.) Most of the cup-shaped based formed below the 50-day line, which makes the pattern weak.


2.) The Dorman stock is holding up extremely well, a significant stock market correction is no time for new buys..


Meanwhile, the stock boasts sound fundamentals, reflected in its unbeatable [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99. An [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 89 is solid, and best-in-class in its industry group.

Dorman Products Earnings Growth Ramps Up
----------------------------------------


Some 84% of Dorman products are sold under brands the Pennsylvania-based company owns. The rest are sold under private labels, other brands or in bulk.


Its products can be found at automotive aftermarket retailers such as **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)).


Dorman products — for powertrains, automotive bodies and chassis — are mostly made by third parties.


But Dorman is the design and engineering brains behind those products, "many of which are better and easier to install and/or use than the original parts they replace," according to the company.


In the September quarter, Dorman's top and bottom line results beat views. The company grew net sales 10% to $248 million, with EPS climbing 31% to $1.06. It launched 1,478 new products in the quarter, a 55% increase year over year.


For full-year 2018, Dorman Products offered EPS growth guidance of 23%-27% and sales growth guidance of 4%-6%.


Over the past three years, Dorman grew EPS at a 14% clip and sales at a 6% rate.

[IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **PayPal Holdings** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is making a case that life without former parent **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) will be fine as revenue ramps up from new partners **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) and others. [PayPal stock](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) has neared a buy point, with fourth-quarter earnings due next week.




PayPal stock has formed a [cup chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), with shares bouncing back since the digital payment processor issued initial 2020 guidance in October. Shares in PayPal hit an all-time high of 121.48 on July 16 but swooned 22% following an unexpected midyear cut in the company's revenue forecast.


PayPal reports earnings after the close Jan. 29. Analysts expect updated 2020 guidance at that time, which would include the $4 billion acquisition of [shopping app Honey Science](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-pypl-acquires-honey-consumer-shopping-app/).


Analysts also are interested in the outlook for Venmo's revenue growth and path to profitability. The Venmo money transfer service plans to launch a credit card in 2020.

One trading strategy for investors heading into company earnings reports is using [call options](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/stock-market-strategies-using-options-around-earnings-helps-minimize-risk/).


PayPal Stock: Refined Update Expected
-------------------------------------


"PayPal's initial 2020 outlook was well-received by investors, as there was elevated concern going into the (third quarter) print on its ability to achieve a level of growth consistent with its medium-term guidance range of 17% to 18% in 2020 given potential headwinds from eBay," Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg said in a report to clients.


He added: "Keeping with historical practice, PayPal will likely refine guidance by providing specific dollar ranges for revenue and (earnings per share), as well as guidance for key metrics such as (total payment volume) growth."


PayPal's Relative Strength Rating has improved to 75 out of a best-possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of at least 80 or better. Relative strength lines track a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, and PayPal's RS line still lags.


PayPal stock, meanwhile, has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-if-accumulation-rating-sinks-maybe-your-stock-stinks/) of B. The rating runs from a best-possible A to a worst-possible E. It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. An improving Accumulation/Distribution Rating could be a clue that institutional buyers are gaining confidence that PayPal can thrive without eBay.


Will New Deals Offset eBay Business?
------------------------------------


San Jose, Calif.-based eBay spun off PayPal in 2015. The former parent is phasing out the use of PayPal for its online marketplace, and their deal expires next year. EBay will shift processing to Netherlands-based **Adyen** ([ADYYF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADYYF)) starting in July, and PayPal's revenue and gross payment volume will be impacted.


But bulls point to PayPal's investments in [Latin American e-commerce firm MercadoLibre](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mercadolibre-stock-nears-buy-point-revenue-growth/) as well as in China. PayPal invested $750 million in MercadoLibre in 2019.


In early 2020, the two companies said PayPal will become a payment option on MercadoLibre's website for consumers in Brazil and Mexico. In addition, PayPal will be accepted in MercadoLibre's marketplace in Brazil and Mexico for cross-border transactions.


PayPal Stock: Pushing Into China Payment Market
-----------------------------------------------


PayPal also has made inroads in China. The company on Jan. 22 unveiled an alliance with state-backed China UnionPay. The deal will allow some UnionPay cardholders access to PayPal's network.


In September, China granted PayPal approval to buy a 70% stake in payment firm Gopay Information Technology.


Meanwhile, PayPal also holds a stake in ride-hailing firm Uber. PayPal is developing a digital wallet with Uber.


In addition, PayPal has growing ties with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), though PayPal pulled out of the social networking leader's Libra digital currency project last year. Instagram, the photo-sharing app of Facebook, has been testing a shopping feature called Checkout.


Big Tech Ambitions For Fintech
------------------------------


Other big technology firms, such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Google, are encroaching on PayPal and other industry incumbents with credit cards, checking accounts and other products.


Analysts give PayPal high marks for shifting its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout. Credit card firms **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) are now an option for PayPal users.


Even so, the credit networks are still rivals. Visa, Mastercard, **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Discover Financial Services** ([DFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFC)) last year launched Click To Pay, their unified online checkout button. Click to Pay competes with PayPal's checkout button.


PayPal stock rose 2.4% to 117.89 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?). The company ranks No. 46 in the [IBD 50 roster of growth companies](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). PayPal stock has an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 121.58 heading into fourth-quarter earnings

**RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after the high-end furniture chain cleared stubborn resistance amid a short consolidation intraday but closed back below a buy point. Warren Buffett is a noted backer of RH stock.




While sales have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the firm is bullish on its prospects heading into the second half of the year. The firm is also looking to expand its reach into new markets.


Shares reversed lower to close down 1.1% at 258.43 on the [stock market today.](http://investors.com/stock-market-today) Earlier in the session, RH stock had risen as high as 275.63 to clear a short, messy consolidation with a buy point of 265.97, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/), as well as resistance at the 265 mark.


It formed a V-shaped consolidation, though action was tighter in recent weeks. [Patterns that are V-shaped can be more failure-prone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/v-shaped-bases-are-prone-to-failure/). There is also a [wedging shape on weekly charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flawed-chart-patterns-why-a-wedging-handle-is-bad-news-for-investors/). This should also give investors pause, as such action often fails to shake out weak holders.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for RH stock spiked from April to June but has since been flat and came off recent highs Monday. It is also well clear of its 50-day line. Shares are still up more than 200% from coronavirus crash lows.


RH stock has a strong, but not ideal, [IBD Composite Rating of 91.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) While stock market performance is its strongest feature, earnings are also strong. This is reflected in its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 85.

Shares of rival **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) had also been consolidating but fell 2.5% Monday. [Retail-Home Furnishings industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jul-10-2020/) leader **Sleep Number** ([SNBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNBR)), which is set to post Q2 earnings on Wednesday, sank 6.4%.


**Tempur Sealy International** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) has built a cup-with-handle base with a 77.06 buy point, and fell 1.7% to 72.04. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) is also arguably offering an early entry after clearing some of the resistance in its new flat base. Conservative investors may prefer to wait for it to clear its base buy point of 259.39.


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-r-h-rh.aspx) tool shows earnings have risen by an average of 105% over the past three years. This is very strong performance.



Sales Rebound Seen For RH Stock
-------------------------------


When RH posted earnings in June, [management declined to provide specific guidance due to overall uncertainties](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-earnings-q1-2020-rh-stock/). But it said "we have experienced a strong rebound in the second quarter and are optimistic that these business trends will continue."


While it sees revenue growth lagging demand in Q2 by 10 to 12 percentage points, RH sees a boost in the second half of the year as manufacturing recovers and inventory catches up to demand.


"Business continued to accelerate in May with our core RH business demand increasing approximately 7% year over year, with significantly higher product margins," a shareholder letter said. "That trend has accelerated into the first week of June with our core RH business demand up approximately 11% despite business disruption due to the recent civil unrest in many markets."


RH stock jumped after CEO Gary Friedman told shareholders in a letter that he now sees a "clear path" to a 20% operating margin over the "next few years," up from 14.3% margin in 2019.


He also envisions eventually moving beyond the luxury home furnishings market to the $1.7 trillion North American housing market by [offering furnished turnkey homes and condominiums via a new segment called RH Residences](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-stock-jumps-warren-buffett-backed-retailer-sees-strong-margins-2020/).


This is a [key consideration for the CAN SLIM cognoscenti](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), with the N in the acronym standing for new products.


Warren Buffett Backs RH
-----------------------


Another key quality the canny CAN SLIM investor is always looking out for is institutional sponsorship. Here RH stock scores highly.


Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) is a notable backer of the luxury furniture chain. It currently holds 1.71 million shares, which is almost 9% of its stock. RH shares got a big boost in February when it emerged that [Berkshire had grown the size of its holdings by 41%.](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/leading-retail-stock-rh-gets-a-boost-from-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway/)


The likes of Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock are all institutions that hold even larger stakes in the company. Notable funds with stakes include Fidelity Blue Chip Growth (MUTF), Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth (FRSIX) and Fidelity Small Cap Growth (FCPGX). These are all rated as A+ funds by IBD. Overall, 61% of shares are currently owned by big money.

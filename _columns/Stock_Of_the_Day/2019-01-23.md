**Wright Medical Group** ([WMGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMGI)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the orthopedic products stock looks to turn profitable in 2019 following several quarters of double-digit sales growth.




The medical stock has a long history in the red. But analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research say that could end this year. In 2019, analysts expect Wright to post yearly income of 24 cents per share, minus certain items. Wright stock is currently forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 29.59. Shares climbed 1.1% to close at 28.90 Wednesday.


Sales growth also is expected to continue. Wright recently [preannounced fourth-quarter revenue](http://ir.wright.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=129751&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2382265) of $238.1 million, rising 10.3% in constant currency. Needham analyst Mike Matson expects that growth to continue in 2019. He projects Wright ending the year with 11% organic revenue growth.


"We expect Cartiva (a foot and ankle product), a stronger U.S. lower extremities sales force and recently launched products to drive upside to the consensus," he said in a recent note to clients. He kept his buy rating on Wright stock.

Medical Stock Specializing In Orthopedics
-----------------------------------------


Wright specializes in medical products used in surgery. It has a portfolio of products for use in upper extremities — shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand. It also has products for lower extremities, such as the foot and ankle. Plus, the medical stock [sells biologics](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceuticals-and-biologics-differences/), including an injectable drug to help fuse bones.


The company calls these three areas "the fastest growing segments in orthopedics."


Wright's newest product is an injectable bone graft called [Augment Inject](http://www.augmentbonegraft.com/). Augment Inject gained [Food and Drug Administration approval](http://ir.wright.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=129751&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2354347) in June. Further, Wright sells a [device/drug bone graft](http://www.wright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AUGMENT-Bone-Graft-IFU-Instructions-for-Use-LBS054-01-US-1.pdf) product called Augment Bone Graft. The injectable version is offering some upside, though.


Augment products generated $41.5 million in sales over the last 12 months, as of Dec. 30, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a recent report. That was up about $675,000 from Wright's prior report outlining the 12 months leading up to Nov. 25.


"This is the strongest pace of incremental sales posted in a year," he said. "Augment per-day sales began to pick up in August and have trended higher since despite quarter-to-quarter variability."



Wright Stock Garners Fund Interest
----------------------------------


Wright is on deck to report its [fourth-quarter earnings](http://ir.wright.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=129751&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2384415) on Feb. 26. Then, Wells Fargo's Biegelsen expects the medical stock to report 14% growth in the U.S. for Augment products, to $35 million. He notes Augment Inject could cannibalize some sales of the traditional Augment Bone Graft.


But the company "expects Inject to drive meaningful incremental growth as well," he said. About "90% of the accounts have switched from Classic to Injectable. There is no (sales) premium for Inject versus the classic version, which has likely made it easier for customers to transition."


Analysts expect Wright to report adjusted profit of 6 cents per share in the fourth quarter, though 2018 is still projected to end with a 7-cent loss per share. In 2019, the Street sees Wright reversing course and tacking on a 24-cent gain, minus specific items.


Wright stock has an Investor's Business Daily [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 94 out of a best-possible 99. The RS Rating tracks a stock's performance over the past 12 months. In terms of RS Rating, Wright stock is in the top 20 of all medical products stocks. Further, its RS rating hit new highs as the stock's handle was forming, which is a bullish sign.


Though Wright stock has largely traveled sideways since its initial public offering in 2011, two key funds — Fidelity Balanced Fund and T. Rowe New Horizons — have stuck with the medical stock.

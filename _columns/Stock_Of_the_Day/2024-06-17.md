**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) earns the IBD Stock of the Day title for Monday, as CMG shares ascend through a buy range as investors prepare for a 50-for-1 stock split to take effect on June 26. Chipotle stock sits on a year-to-date gain of better than 46%.




The fresh-food chain born in Denver in 1993 helped define the fast-casual dining category. Chipotle stock has rallied nearly 89% from an October low. Despite that gain, on June 13 Goldman Sachs indicated it still has room to run. Goldman initiated coverage with a buy rating and a "selectively constructive" outlook. Goldman placed its price target at 3,730 — about 12% above where Chipotle stock traded on Monday.


Upcoming Chipotle Stock Split
-----------------------------


Earlier this month, shareholders greenlit a 50-for-1 stock split. The board of directors originally [announced the plan on March 19](https://ir.chipotle.com/2024-03-19-CHIPOTLE-BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS-APPROVES-50-FOR-1-STOCK-SPLIT). CMG holders as of June 18 will receive 49 additional shares on June 25. Chipotle stock will begin trading on a post-split basis on June 26.


It will be Chipotle's first stock split in its 30-year history and one of the biggest splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE's last 50-for-1 stock split was Berkshire Hathaway's all the way back in 2010, MarketWatch reported. Previously, Nasdaq-listed **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) completed a 20-for-1 split on June 6, 2022.


[Stock splits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-splits-nvidia-amazon-stock-splits-benefit-or-hurt-a-stock/) spread the market value of a company across a greater number of shares, which results in a lower price point for the stock. The total market capitalization of the company and the stock's chart pattern remain unchanged after a stock split, but liquidity increases due to the issuance of more shares. A lower share price does make it easier to trade options.


Meanwhile, Chipotle will release second-quarter results on July 24, about a month after the split.


FactSet analysts expect Q2 earnings growth to slow slightly after accelerating the last two quarters, with a 24% increase to $15.63 per share. The sales target calls for a 16% jump, to $2.93 billion.


Chipotle Stock Action
---------------------


Chipotle stock has not built a proper base since a breakout in November. It rebounded from 10-week support in January and in April.


Its current move is a bit of a hat trick. Shares rebounded from 10-week support. The chart also shows a three weeks tight pattern with a 3,242.66 buy point. Shares remain in a buy range on that pattern through 3,404.93.



In addition, investors could plot a buy point at the May 10 high of 3,260. That would put shares in a buy range through 3,423.


Chipotle is currently about 8% above its 50-day line, on a daily [MarketSurge chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF). It is 5.6% above its 10-week line on a weekly chart. This year, the stock has been extended as much as 12.9% above its 10-week, in January, and 10.7% in March.


CMG stock rose 2.9%, to 3,365.46 on Monday.

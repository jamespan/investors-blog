**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the chipmaker racks up design wins from automotive and transportation companies for its computer-vision products. AMBA stock popped higher on Thursday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), AMBA stock rose 5.6% to close at 158.65.


AMBA stock rebounded Thursday from a pullback to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) line. Investors could use this as a chance to buy some shares, keeping in mind the market is technically still in a correction. Ambarella had retreated after notching an all-time high 169.28 on Sept. 23.


Investors could have picked up shares on Sept. 9 as it decisively broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 137.31, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts. AMBA stock had flirted with that buy point in the four days prior but couldn't close above it.

AMBA Stock Scores Automotive Wins
---------------------------------


Ambarella has attracted supporters on Wall Street as it [shifts to the automotive market](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/ambarella-stock-rises-on-automotive-camera-prospects/). (See more in IBD's [New America column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-new-america/).)


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company today gets most of its revenue from chips for security and surveillance camera systems. But it has started to provide computer-vision chips for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. It already makes chips for dashcams and driver-monitoring systems.


Ambarella specializes in video-processing chips infused with artificial intelligence so that AI processing can be done in the camera instead of on a remote server.


This year, Ambarella has announced a host of design wins from fleet management companies and automakers.


In March, Motional, a global leader in driverless technology, selected Ambarella's CVflow family of AI processors for its driverless vehicles. Ride-hailing service **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) is working with Motional to launch a multimarket robotaxi service in major U.S. cities, beginning in 2023.


In August, **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) announced that it will deploy Ambarella-based driver-monitoring cameras in its fleet of ride-hailing vehicles by 2022. Yandex also will offer its camera to delivery van fleets.


Also in August, KeepTruckin, a fleet management technology firm, announced that it will use Ambarella chips for AI-enabled dashcams.


Other Ambarella customers include electric-vehicle maker **Arrival** ([ARVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARVL)) and China-based automakers Great Wall Motors and Dongfeng Motor Group.


Ambarella Tops In Industry Group
--------------------------------


AMBA stock is tied for first place among 29 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ambarella-inc-amba.aspx). It is one of six stocks in the group with a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.


The fabless semiconductor group ranks a lofty seventh out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Three months ago, it ranked No. 45. And six months ago, it ranked No. 137. Growth stock investors should focus on the leading stocks in the top 40 industry groups.


AMBA stock has an [IBD Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96 out of 99. That means it has outperformed 96% of stocks over the past 12 months.


Also, AMBA stock has a best-possible [IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of A+. That indicates heavy institutional buying of Ambarella stock.

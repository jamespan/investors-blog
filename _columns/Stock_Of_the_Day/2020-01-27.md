The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it offers broad exposure to booming homebuilder stocks. The exchange traded fund is at the top of an official buy range, though investors might want to wait for a pullback.




Buying ITB lets investors play the housing sector, avoiding stock-specific risk, especially with many stocks currently extended. The ITB ETF's top holdings are **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), which makes up 13% of its portfolio, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), which is 11.5%, **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), which is 9.8%, **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), which is 7.3% and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), which is 4.8%.


Homebuilders and related stocks are thriving as low interest rates, tight labor markets and delayed buying by millennials are fueling housing demand. With Treasury yields tumbling in recent days as coronavirus fears spur safe-haven flows, housing stocks and ETFs have gotten another kick.


D.R. Horton vaulted out of a buy zone Monday after [besting estimates on the top and bottom lines and giving bullish guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/d-r-horton-earnings-q1-2020-pultegroup-earnings-q4-2019/). PulteGroup stock, also extended, reports results Tuesday. NVR stock is in a buy zone, with earnings likely to come in the near futures. Lennar stock broke out earlier this month in the wake of solid earnings. Home Depot stock is basing, with earnings not until late February.

ITB ETF Technical Analysis
--------------------------


ITB rose was flat at 48.41 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It's near the top of a buy zone after clearing a six-week flat base, [MarketSmith analysis shows.](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was 46.30, and the chase zone ends at 48.62.


With ETFs, it's often best to buy them on pullbacks. Investors might want to wait for ITB to pull back to near the top of its base, around the 21-day moving average.


It is trading well above its 50-day moving average, which is a bullish sign. The relative strength line has been trending upward since the end of December and is nearing its October peak. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, has been generally making progress since October 2018, but has not yet hit its longtime high set at the end of 2017.



While the top builders in the ITB index are extended, Home Depot stock has formed a cup base with a 239.41 buy point. HD stock is on track after Tuesday to have a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on the daily chart. Here the entry point will be 231.02. However HD's stock market performance has been lackluster, with the RS line falling from a mid-October peak.


Home Depot stock fell 0.35% to 231.19 Monday, after dropping to 228.20 intraday. D.R. Horton stock climbed 2% and Lennar stock 1%. NVR stock slid 0.9% and Pulte stock 2.8%.


Keep in mind that Treasury yields and mortgage rates could jump, at least in the short term.


New-Home Sales Fall
-------------------


The Commerce Department revealed Monday that December new-home sales fell 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 units, after November sales were revised down. Economists had expected new-home sales to come it at 730,000. But the new-home sales figures follow recent data showing existing-home sales vaulting to near a two-year high with housing starts spiking to a 13-year best.


The new-home sales figures contrast sales of previously owned homes, which vaulted to near a two-year high in December. Housing starts also ran up to a 13-year peak.


CFRA Research's Global Director of Industry and Equity Research Ken Leon previously told IBD there was plenty of momentum heading into 2020 for the housing market. The strong economy is one reason why demand will be strong.


"The foundation for a strong housing market is driven by employment growth, higher household income, and high consumer confidence levels," Leon said. "We're also seeing the secular change to millennial households beginning to acquire their first homes."

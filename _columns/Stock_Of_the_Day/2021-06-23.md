**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the company that made smartphone cameras a key ingredient for social media broke into a buy zone Wednesday. Snap stock has approached an entry point several times recently but hit resistance.




The company has posted three quarters in a row of accelerating double-digit revenue growth and is expected to maintain that streak in the current quarter.


The company's Snapchat is a smartphone app that can manipulate and enhance images and videos in numerous ways and lets users share them with other Snapchat users. It also has an expanding lineup of video content and games, among many other features. It's popular with the under-30 crowd.


At the end of the first quarter Snapchat had 281 million daily active users, up 16 million from the prior quarter. The firm's primary source of revenue is advertising.

Snap competes primarily with the Instagram app owned by **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).Â In fact, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg liked Snapchat so much he offered to buy the company in 2013 for $3 billion. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, a company co-founder, said no thanks.


Snap Stock: Current Market Value Near $100 Billion
--------------------------------------------------


Then, in 2017, Snap scored big with its eye-catching [initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) that raised $3.4 billion and gave it a market valuation of $24 billion. That made [Snap the largest U.S.-listed IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-continues-heady-ascent-following-eye-popping-ipo/) among tech companies since Facebook. Its current market value is near $100 billion.


In mid-May, Snap introduced its first augmented reality smart glasses called Spectacles. The company previously released camera-embedded sunglasses under the same name. But the new Spectacles aren't for consumers yet. The company is making them available to software developers to see what sorts of applications they can create with them. Applications for AR technology include navigation, education, games, commerce and more.


Snap Enters Buy Zone
--------------------


Snap stock has tried to break out into a buy range several times since mid-April, but continued to hit resistance and pulled back while it consolidated. That resistance point was established on April 14 at 65.86. That put the [current buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 65.96 out of a cup formation, extending to 69.26.


Shares jumped into a buy zone during afternoon trading Wednesday, ending the day 5.4% higher at 66.35 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


On April 22, Snap reported a better-than-expected [earnings report for the first quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-climbs-on-first-quarter-results/) and gave a second-quarter outlook that also exceeded expectations. Snap stock jumped 7% in reaction.


The company is based in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica, Calif. Revenue in 2020 jumped 46% to $2.5 billion. This year revenue is expected to accelerate 56% to $3.9 billion.

Snap Stock: Hearty IBD Composite Rating
---------------------------------------


The [IBD Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-snap-inc-cl-a-snap.aspx) shows that Snap currently has a hearty [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Snap stock currently outperforms 96% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


It has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92. The rating shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in IBD's database.


Snap stock also trades above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) moving average. However, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is choppy and moving sideways. The relative strength line compares a stock's price action with that of the S&P 500. A rising line tells you the stock is outperforming the benchmark index. A falling RS line means the stock is lagging.

**CrowdStrike Holdings** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as cybersecurity stocks rally in the wake of a widespread ransomware attack. CrowdStrike stock cleared an entry point as shares in **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) also climbed.


Cybersecurity officials worldwide are racing to assess the damage from a new ransomware linked to Russian cyber-gang REvil. The ransomware attack focused on companies that use software from Kaseya VSA. The attackers are reportedly demanding a $70 million ransomware payment.


One bullish view for [cybersecurity stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/) is that the Biden administration will hike spending on cybersecurity following earlier ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline and meat producer JBS.


Founded by two former McAfee executives in 2011, CrowdStrike specializes in security protection for network endpoints. That includes personal computers, servers, laptops, and mobile devices that access networks.

CrowdStrike's software uses artificial intelligence and a specialized database to detect malware.


CrowdStrike Stock Joins IBD Leaderboard
---------------------------------------


CrowdStrike utilizes a patented "Threat Graph" database to analyze and correlate billions of events collected from customers in real time. The Threat Graph analyzes more than 1 trillion events per week, feeding data to CrowdStrike's artificial intelligence algorithms.


"We think (endpoint) solutions and especially managed (endpoint) solutions like those offered by CrowdStrike play an important role in quickly alerting customers of malicious activity and updating prevention policies to protect customers going forward," UBS analyst Roger Boyd said in a note to clients Tuesday.


CrowdStrike stock holds a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90, second-best in the IBD Computer-Software Security group. **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) holds a rating of 91.


With Tuesday's gain, CrowdStrike stock joined the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) along with [**Shopify**](https://www.investors.com/research/shopify-stock-buy-now/) ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). It's a curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.


Cybersecurity Stocks Rally On Ransomware Attacks
------------------------------------------------


CrowdStrike stock had retreated in February and March amid a pullback in software growth stocks. The cybersecurity firm bucked investor worries over its valuation and began clawing back in May, forming a consolidation.


The stock moved just above the top of the [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) on June 22, then cleared a high-handle entry point of 260.92 on Tuesday. The stock is pulling away from its 10-week moving average. Shares were up 4.9% to close at 264.98 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The rise of cryptocurrency Bitcoin may be tied to a spike in ransomware attacks, analysts say. Digital ransoms are often paid in Bitcoin. In ransomware attacks, predators lock up a victim's computers until a ransom is paid.


"In terms of cleanup, while ransomware remediation is often difficult, we think there could be potential service opportunities for incident response and digital forensics providers including CRWD, Palo Alto Networks and **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE))," said UBS's Boyd.


Meanwhile, Zscaler stock on Tuesday broke out from a cup-with-handle base.


CrowdStrike Stock: Expanding To Cloud Security
----------------------------------------------


In the endpoint market, CrowdStrike competes with **Broadcom**'s ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) Symantec, McAfee and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Sunnyvale, Calif.-based CrowdStrike earnings came in at an adjusted 10 cents a share. Revenue jumped 70% to $302.8 million, including acquisitions, the company said. Analysts had projected CrowdStrike would earn 6 cents on revenue of $291.4 million for the period ended April 30.


CrowdStrike has expanded into protecting business applications that run on public cloud computing platforms. CrowdStrike also has launched security vulnerability management services.


Additionally, the company has made two acquisitions broadening its product offerings and could make more, CrowdStrike stock analysts say. CrowdStrike in March purchased Humio, which sells cloud-based network monitoring tools, for $392 million in cash and stock.


And in September 2020, CrowdStrike acquired Preempt Security, a provider of "Zero Trust" tools, for about $96 million. Zero Trust cybersecurity models establish trust based on the credentials of a user, device and application regardless of location â€” either within the network perimeter or outside.


The IPO for CrowdStrike stock in June 2019 raised $659 million.

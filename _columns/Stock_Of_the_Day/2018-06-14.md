**Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the recent IPO leapt into buy range. It's the latest newly public software maker to power higher, joining **Pivotal Software** ([PVTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVTL)), **Zuora** ([ZUO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUO)) and others.




The cloud storage company, which [started trading on March 23 after pricing at 21](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dropbox-poised-for-strong-initial-public-offering-trading-friday/) per share, [topped first-quarter earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dropbox-earnings-guidance-tech-stocks/) estimates last month. Adjusted Q1 profit popped 300% to 8 cents a share on 28% revenue growth to $316 million.


CEO Drew Houston said then that growth in paid users and premium plan adoption drove up revenue for the quarter. The company racked up $1.1 billion in revenue in 2017.


Dropbox allows its 500 million users to store documents and photos in the cloud and access them from any device. About 11 million of them pay for its storage services. [Subscription plans](https://www.dropbox.com/help/billing/cost) range from a free Dropbox Basic account with 2 GB of space to Dropbox Plus and Dropbox Professional with 1 TB of space, to Dropbox Business for organizations.

Pivotal, Zuora Among Industry Peers On The Rise
-----------------------------------------------


Several software peers, also recent IPOs, are on the rise. **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)) spinoff Pivotal Software, a [major public offering out of Silicon Valley](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pivotal-software-ipo-trades-friday/), surged 33% Wednesday on the back of a well-received earnings report.


Subscription management platform [Zuora went public in April](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zuora-ipo/) and has been on a tear since reporting earnings on May 31.


Other newly traded software names on a similar upswing include **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Carbon Black** ([CBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBLK)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Pluralsight** ([PS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PS)) and **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)).


Dropbox, Pivotal, DocuSign and Smartsheet are all part of the enterprise software group, which is ranked No. 2 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Zscaler and Carbon Black are in the No. 7-rated security software industry while Pluralsight is in the No. 28 design software group.


Dropbox stands out from Pivotal Software, Zuora, Carbon Black and most of these other hot software IPOs in one key respect. The companies is turning profitable with strong EPS growth expected through 2019.

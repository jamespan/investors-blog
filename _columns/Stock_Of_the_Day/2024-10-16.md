**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) announced Wednesday that it's joining the nuclear renaissance, sending nuclear-related stocks higher, including **Cameco** ([CCJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCJ)), Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


The uranium refiner broke out past a buy point after Amazon said it has signed agreements to develop the emerging small modular reactor technology — joining a growing list of tech giants that are investing in nuclear power to run data centers.


[S&P 500 leader](https://www.investors.com/news/sp500-vistra-stock-constellation-energy-stock-lag-market/) **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)) and small-modular reactor play **Oklo** ([OKLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKLO)) were among the other nuclear-powered stocks.


Top hyperscalers — the largest cloud, data center and AI operators — include Amazon.com, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Meta** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Amazon's decision to invest in small modular reactors, or SMRs, comes just a day after a similar announcement by Google. SMRs do not currently exist but there are a number of companies working to develop the technology.




In late September, **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) announced a [two-decade contract with **Microsoft**](https://www.investors.com/news/sp-500-nuclear-inks-microsoft-deal-three-mile-island-restart/) to provide nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers. The deal involves reopening Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1, which had been idle since 2019. Three Mile Island's Unit 2 reactor has been shut down since the 1979, after the partial meltdown at the nuclear power plant.


Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro wrote that the Constellation-Microsoft deal "[proves out the value of nuclear power for hyperscalers](https://www.investors.com/news/sp500-constellation-energy-price-target-hikes-microsoft-nuclear-power-deal/), with higher prices for future deals."


This is good news for Canada-based Cameco, which is one of the world's largest providers of uranium with utilities around the globe relying on the company to provide nuclear fuel solutions.


AI And Nuclear
--------------


So far in 2024, nuclear power and utility stocks have been riding the artificial intelligence energy wave.


Artificial intelligence — and the data centers needed to train the systems — are expected to boost energy demand throughout this decade. In the U.S., McKinsey & Co. projects that data center energy demand will grow from around 4% currently to 11%-12% by 2030.

Many technology companies are investing in or partnering with nuclear power providers to ensure energy supplies for their data centers.


Morgan Stanley analysts have proclaimed in recent months that a "nuclear renaissance" is underway.


They wrote that nuclear power, while still a divisive issue, is making a comeback. The firm sees $1.5 trillion in investment in new capacity through 2050.

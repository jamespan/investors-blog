**Exact Sciences** ([EXAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXAS)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Shares of EXAS stock are reversing from a downtrend on a promising cancer diagnostic test.




On Friday, Exact Sciences unveiled the results of a clinical study analyzing use of its diagnostic test in patients with breast cancer. The diagnostic test helped patients avoid needless chemotherapy — a boon due to the toxicity that chemo presents.


"These data highlight the role of the test in further individualizing treatment decisions in breast cancer," Exact Sciences said in a news release.


Shares of EXAS stock have been creating a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base and a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 139.36. EXAS stock hasn't surpassed that mark yet, but it became actionable Thursday as it broke a recent downtrend. On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), EXAS stock popped 6.8% to close at 136.04.

EXAS Stock Rises Out Of A Downtrend
-----------------------------------


The clinical study weighed the benefit of Exact Sciences' Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Recurrence Score. Patients in the five-year study were all considered candidates for chemotherapy based on traditional parameters.


Based on the results of their cancer diagnostic test, patients were split into groups. Some patients were treated only with anti-hormonal therapy, though traditionally they would have received chemotherapy. After five years, 96% were free of cancer.


In another analysis, 864 breast cancer patients received chemotherapy based on their Recurrence Score. The results show that score is a strong predictor of who will respond to chemotherapy.


Shares of EXAS stock were ensconced in a downtrend last week, helping to form the handle. Now, EXAS stock is creating a strong base after a big gap-up from its prior chart pattern, according to [MarketSmith.com](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).



The move Thursday followed the addition of EXAS stock to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader). EXAS stock also beat its industry group in terms of performance Thursday, as shares of [biotech companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-stocks-best-biotech-companies-to-invest-in/) broadly advanced 3.7% in midday trades.


Representatives of Exact Sciences couldn't immediately comment for this story.


Strong Performance This Year
----------------------------


According to [IBD Digital](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital), EXAS stock has a bullish [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) of 91. The RS Rating is a 1-99 measure of a stock's 12-month performance. This means EXAS stock ranks in the top 9% of all stocks in terms of its performance.


It's important to note, however, that Exact Sciences isn't profitable. Still, quarterly sales have grown at least at a double-digit clip for years. The company's quarterly revenue stems primarily from diagnostic tests for colon cancer, breast cancer and Covid-19.


In the current quarter, analysts polled by FactSet forecast adjusted losses of 25 cents per share on $425.5 million in sales. Losses would widen year over year, but sales would pop 44%.

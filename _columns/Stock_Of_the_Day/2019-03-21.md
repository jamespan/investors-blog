**Woodward** ([WWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the industrial manufacturer tests a buy point.




The Colorado-based company makes energy control systems and components for aircraft and industrial engines and turbines.


As investors chase growth, many can find their portfolios over-concentrated in tech stocks. Woodward stock offers a chance to diversify, which can help reduce risk. It currently holds the number one position in the [Machinery-General Industrial Group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-20-2019/).


Management is bullish on its ongoing performance and outlook due to enhanced operational execution. It has also been seizing share in the widebody commercial aircraft field due to its strategy to become a systems integrator.


Woodward has also been making moves in the mergers and acquisition space. Last April, it bought Rolls-Royce's power systems business L'Orange GmbH for $859 million.


The firm, now named Woodward L'Orange, supplies fuel injection technology for engines that power industrial applications. Analysts expect the move to boost Woodward's industrial segment going forward.

Woodward Stock Has Solid Fundamentals
-------------------------------------


Woodward stock has a top-notch [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 98. Earnings are a key driver, with the [Stock Checkup Tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-woodward-inc-wwd.aspx) showing that its average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters is a healthy 53%. And earnings have been accelerating for the last two quarters, coming in at 85% growth in January.


Sales have been growing by an average of 19% over the last four quarters while also accelerating for the past two quarters.


[CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) connoisseurs are always on the lookout for names showing rising institutional ownership. Here the evidence is lukewarm. Net gains in institutional buying have been decent, but not overwhelming. This is reflected in its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-tools/accumulationslhdistribution-(accslhdistm)-rating) of C+.


Woodward Stock Technical Analysis
---------------------------------


Shares rose 1.3% to close at 97.17 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), and briefly cleared a 97.49 buy point from a 3-weeks tight pattern intraday, [MarketSmith analysis shows](https://marketsmith.investors.com/). When a stock with [top-notch fundamentals](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) holds firm near a certain price level for at least three straight weeks, it can give the alert investor a chance to add shares ahead of a solid price run and new highs.


A bullish sign for Woodward stock is it has been getting support at 10-week line, which has strengthened its consolidation. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is also near a new high.


But most stocks will pause to take a breather once they've run up about 20%. So a prudent rule of thumb is to [take profits when you're up 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) on most of your stocks.


Woodward is a good candidate for the 20% sell rule for a number of reasons. For one, estimates indicate earnings and sales growth will slow down, as results lap the year-ago boost from the L'Orange deal and come up against tougher comparisons.


And while the RS line is up now, Woodward stock has history of performing in line with the S&P 500, but not really outperforming. Case in point: the RS line tends to move sideways for long periods.


Analyst Sees Upside To Woodward Stock
-------------------------------------


Cowen managing director Gautam Khanna was impressed with the firm's strong earnings in January, raising his price target to 87 from 78 even as he retained his market perform rating on Woodward stock.


"Q1's beat owed to stronger results at L'Orange and outsized aftermarket growth," he said in a research note. "For the first time in many years, we see potential upside to WWD's F19 guidance."


He also approved of a more restrained approach from management when giving guidance.


"Management's decision to not raise F19 guidance despite a strong Q1 reflects conservatism regarding non-aero Industrial macros, a welcome departure from WWD's recent history of setting optimistic Industrial guidance," he said.

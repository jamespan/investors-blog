**TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it may soon offer existing shareholders a chance to buy more shares.







There are signs of strength in the off-price segment in particular, whose brick-and-mortar "treasure hunt" bargain-hunting environment has been lauded for its seeming immunity to **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


The T.J. Maxx parent is [not the only discounter doing well](https://www.investors.com/research/retail-sector-ross-stock-tjx-stock-dollar-general-stock-burlington-stock/). Off-price peer **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) is approaching an add-on buying opportunity, and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) is still in buy territory after clearing an 84.67 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in early June.


TJX, which is in a [four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) pattern, was up 0.2% to 95.70 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), slightly below a 96.92 entry point, an [add-on buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) that follows a more-than-20% climb from its most recent breakout.



Shares have mostly kept abreast of their 50-day moving average this calendar year, accelerating their climb above the key level starting in May, when the stock got an additional boost of confidence from a [solid earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/tjx-reports-q1-earnings-ross-stores-tj-maxx-marshalls/).


TJX stock's Relative Strength line is now at levels not seen since late 2016, and the stock recently hit a new all-time high of 96.82 in late June.

Stock Of The Day: How TJX Measures Up
-------------------------------------


Better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales figures marked TJX's most recently reported quarter, and management raised the low end of full-year profit guidance.


TJX, which has earned a 96 Composite Rating, is a member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which ranks No. 8 out of the 197 groups that IBD tracks. In addition to Burlington and Ross, **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) and **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) are part of this particular retail group.


[Retail sector stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/the-retail-revival-snapshot/) have turned in a surprisingly strong performance so far in 2018. **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), not a direct peer to TJX but another discounter company, is another recent IBD Stock Of The Day highlight.


RBC analyst Brian Tunick recently told IBD that the entire off-price industry, which includes TJX, Ross Stores, Burlington Stores and Nordstrom Rack, is "essentially already bigger than the department store channel that they're supposedly offering a value from."


And with plans for the off-price industry to grow by another 2,000 brick-and-mortar stores over the next decade or so, Tunick said "you're talking about a $20-plus billion pull of revenue opportunity."

BTU shares edged higher Tuesday, closing in on an early entry point.

Higher natural gas prices are one of the leading factors driving a powerful rally in coal stocks during the first half of 2022. Global natural gas supplies tightened and prices rose following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. After an initial run-up, Peabody, like many coal stocks, has consolidated since April.


Inflated coal prices helped Peabody Energy top earnings and revenue views in its third-quarter results in early November. The company reported EPS of $2.34, up from a 60-cent loss a year ago. Revenue advanced 99% to $1.3 billion.


Peabody Energy's Q3 results were led by its seaborne thermal coal division, with deliveries primarily to the Asia-Pacific market. In addition, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization grew 64% to $171 million, as the average realized price rose 31%.


In Q3, Peabody Energy's U.S. thermal coal business delivered $111 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 35% from a year ago.


Coal Stock Comeback
-------------------


Coming off of a slew of bankruptcies throughout the last decade, the coal industry has made a comeback in 2022 on the back of increased natural gas prices that have made coal a more competitive fuel. The International Energy Agency has projected that global coal demand will match record highs in 2022 and increase to new highs in 2023.


Col miners including Peabody Energy and coal mining outfits **Alliance Resource Partners** ([ARLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARLP)), **Alpha Metallurgical Resources** ([AMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMR)) and **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) have rebounded into constructive chart patterns.

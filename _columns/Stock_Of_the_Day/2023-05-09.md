**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the maker of customer relationship management software flirts with a buy point. CRM stock has been on a tear this year.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), CRM stock rose 1.7% to close at 201.18. With the advance, it cleared a 200.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/), based on [IBD trading principles](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).


CRM stock also is above a 200.22 entry from [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) charts.

CRM Stock Rockets After Earnings Report
---------------------------------------


On March 2, [Salesforce stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-buy-now/) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) at a buy point of 178.94, MarketSmith charts show. The [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) occurred after Salesforce delivered a [beat-and-raise report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-earnings-salesforce-stock-q42022/) for its fiscal fourth quarter.


The enterprise software firm said its adjusted earnings rose 100% to $1.68 per share in the quarter ended Jan. 31. Revenue rose 14% to $8.38 billion.


Meanwhile, Salesforce has been tussling with [activist investors](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-elliott-management-avoid-battle-over-board-of-directors/) who are pushing for changes at the company.


AI Could Improve Company's Offerings
------------------------------------


Salesforce sells software under a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. The company has expanded into marketing, customer services and e-commerce.


Jefferies analyst Brent Thill sees Salesforce getting a boost from its efforts in generative artificial intelligence.


In a note to clients last week, Thill said generative AI will enhance productivity for customers and will allow Salesforce to raise prices.


"While still early days in terms of adoption, Salesforce's AI vision impressed both the partners and customers we spoke to," Thill said. He rates CRM stock as buy with a price target of 250.

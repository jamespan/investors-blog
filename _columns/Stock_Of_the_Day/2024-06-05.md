**ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the semiconductor equipment leader chalks up a big sale to major customer **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), better known as TSMC.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), ASML stock hit an early-entry [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 992.88, based on [IBD analysis](https://get.investors.com/ibd-live/). With the move higher, it broke out of a handle. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) extends to 1,042.52.Â  The shares rose 9.5% to close at 1,041.34.


The early-entry buy point is within a larger [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) with a buy point of 1,056.34, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) charts.


ASML stock reacted positively to a news report that TSMC has purchased ASML's high numerical aperture, extreme ultraviolet lithography system. A TSMC executive had previously said the high-NA EUV machine was too expensive. The machines cost about $380 million apiece.


TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, will take delivery of the cutting-edge equipment this year, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/asml-to-ship-its-380-million-machine-to-tsmc-samsung-this-year?sref=FwsjHXQj).


Meanwhile, chipmaker **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) has already taken delivery of the first high-NA EUV system from ASML. The gear enables chipmakers to make smaller transistors with higher transistor densities than previously possible.


ASML Stock On IBD Leaderboard
-----------------------------


ASML is the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment.


Analysts say TSMC is likely to use the new gear to make chips at the A14 node in 2028. The A14 node is 1.4 nanometers. The semiconductor industry measures circuit widths on chips in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter.


ASML stock ranks eighth out of 27 stocks in IBD's semiconductor equipment industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-asml-holding-asml.aspx). It has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 89 out of 99.

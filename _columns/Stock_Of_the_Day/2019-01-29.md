**TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after reporting a fourth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth. TransDigm stock soared Tuesday, racing past an aggressive entry and just topping a conventional buy point. The industrial firm is a supplier to aerospace giants such as **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)) and **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)).




Cleveland-based TransDigm makes a range of parts, such as controls, actuators, ignition systems, gear pumps and other components for the aerospace industry. Boeing and Airbus accounted for 21% of its revenue in 2017-18. The firm says its components are used in nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service.


On Tuesday TransDigm revealed its sales had jumped 17% to $993 million for the quarter ending Dec. 30. While the results are preliminary and the firm has yet to post earnings, this will mark the fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth. EBITDA rose 21% to $487 million.

A bullish indicator for TransDigm stock is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which is at record highs. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.



TransDigm stock has good but not great fundamentals, which is reflected in its [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 73. TransDigm earnings growth has been in the single digits for six of the last seven quarters. But analysts expect 29% TransDigm earnings growth for the latest quarter. The official TransDigm earnings report is due Feb. 5.


Boeing Stock Near Buy Point
---------------------------


A strong Boeing earnings report Wednesday morning could act as another catalyst. Boeing stock rose 0.5% to 364.91 Tuesday, with the Dow Jones component just below a 367.42 handle buy point.


**Woodward** ([WWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWD)), whose aerospace segment makes controls systems, scored an earnings beat Tuesday. Woodward stock spiked 12% to 86.78. Intraday shares rose to 90.75, clearing an 89.40 buy point from a consolidation going back nearly a year.


Seeing other aerospace names act well is a good sign for TransDigm stock.


TransDigm Gobbles Up Rival Esterline
------------------------------------


Last October TransDigm announced it would buy **Esterline** ([ESL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESL)) in a $4 billion deal. TransDigm is financing the deal via cash on hand and a $2 billion loan.


TransDigm's preliminary figures came as the company proposed an offering of senior subordinated notes and senior secured notes. A portion of those proceeds will help fund the Esterline acquisition.

Big-box retailer **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) after reporting blowout first-quarter earnings Wednesday. Target stock rebounded bullishly from key support.




Earnings skyrocketed 525% to $3.69 a share, crushing forecasts for $2.20, as sales rose 23% to $24.20 billion, topping estimates for $21.86 billion.


Same-store sales leapt 22.9%, more than double the Consensus Metrix estimate for an 11.2% gain. In-store comps leapt 18%, while digital sales jumped 50% after a 141% spike a year earlier as the pandemic first hit.


Revenue and earnings were buoyed by January and March stimulus check disbursements. Digital sales continue to be strong, although growth is slowing. The pandemic boosted online comps as much as 195% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020. Growth rates have moderated somewhat since then. Target reported a 118% jump in digital sales in the last quarter of 2020.


The discount giant sees fiscal Q2 comps rising in the mid- to high-single digit range, with positive comps in the last two quarters of the year. Analysts see Target earnings per share falling 27% to $2.47 in Q2 and sales declining 5.5% to $21.72 billion, as the company faces tough comparisons.


'One Of The Truly Stellar Performers'
-------------------------------------


After the report, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson raised his price target on Target stock to 250 from 225, while keeping a buy rating.


"We continue to like how TGT is positioned among Big Box retailers with its more discretionary product mix and stronger operating margins, which should help it better navigate cost pressures," he wrote.


Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said the results validate management's decision to use stores as the "center of its online flywheel," allowing customers to choose delivery from stores, in-store pick up, or curbside pick up.


He also highlighted Target's private and exclusive brands as key drivers of revenue and margins.


"Target continues as one of the truly stellar performers in global retail, with plenty of runway evident as the U.S. progresses toward a greater degree of normalcy," O'Shea added.

Target Stock
------------


Shares rallied 6.1% to close at 219.01 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). Target stock is signaling a bullish rebound from the 10-week moving average, which creates an entry around 204.87.


Breakouts have struggled in recent weeks with the market rally under pressure.


Target stock broke out past a 196.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) on March 26, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares popped past a 210.96 follow-up buy point from a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), but the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) failed when shares quickly reversed.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) spiked after going sideways for a while.


The Target earnings report follows **Walmart's** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) strong Q1 numbers.


On Tuesday, the Dow Jones retail giant reported [better-than-expected Q1 earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q1-2022-walmart-stock/). U.S. same-store sales grew 6%, with Sam's Club comps up 7.2%. That smashed estimates for U.S. comps to rise 0.9% with Sam's Club up 0.7%. U.S. online sales growth slowed to 37%.


[Walmart stock](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-good-buy/) ended flat Wednesday after rising 2.2% in the prior session.

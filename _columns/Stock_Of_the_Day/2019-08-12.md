**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the social media pioneer hovers near a buy point and recently broke out on a stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings report.




Twitter has formed a very large and deep [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). That handle also qualifies as its own [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), with a 41.02 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) chart analysis. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) tops out at 43.07.


An eight-day dip before the breakout offered an alternative buy point at 39.07. But as a practical matter, 41.02 was the best entry because the stock gapped past 39.07, without giving investors a chance to buy that low.


On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Twitter stock fell 2.6% to 40.46. Twitter held its initial public offering in 2013, pricing shares at 26.

Twitter Second-Quarter Earnings
-------------------------------


After sagging through the spring, Twitter's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/) has rebounded. That rebound came late last month, after [Twitter reported strong second-quarter revenue and user growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-earnings-q2-2019-twitter-stock/). The stock broke out, pulling its relative strength line higher.


Second-quarter revenue jumped 18% to $841 million, above estimates of $829 million. Twitter reported having 139 million daily users at the end of the quarter, up 14% vs. a year earlier and above estimates. Total advertising revenue grew 21% to $727 million.


Quarterly earnings have been particularly strong, growing at a triple-digit rate in five of the last six quarters. Earnings growth has accelerated in the past two quarters.


Twitter is a social media service that allows users to post and interact with messages known as "tweets." It's a go-to source of updates on live events, such as sports, news and entertainment. It's frequently used by public figures, including entertainers and politicians. President Donald Trump uses it daily.


Twitter noted that video continues to be a growing business for the company. During the second quarter, Twitter announced a number of new live and on-demand video content partnerships across entertainment, news, sports and esports.


Engagement Key To Growth
------------------------



Engagement is key to the firm's growth, and there are a number of high-profile news events that could help boost the company's numbers, including the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the U.S. elections.


Higher traffic and engagement levels will increase ad demand on Twitter, boosting ad prices and the company's sales.


The company sees third-quarter revenue of $815 million to $875 million. The midpoint of $845 million was below Wall Street estimates for $874 million.


The [IBD Stock Checkup tool](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-twitter-inc-twtr.aspx) shows that Twitter has a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99. The rating measures key performance metrics and technical strength.


Twitter stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) of 91, which reflects its strong [stock market performance.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) It also has a stellar 99 [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=EPS%2fRating&termid=1), which compares quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth against all other stocks.


Twitter currently holds the No. 1 ranking among its peers in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) is No. 2, followed by **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)). The group ranks 81st among 197 groups in recent performance.


However, the stock market is now in correction, so it is unwise to take new positions in stocks, according to [IBD's Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).

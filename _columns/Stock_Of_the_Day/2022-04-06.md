Engineering and construction firm **KBR** ([KBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBR)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The Houston-based company delivers a variety of science, technology and engineering solutions to governments and companies worldwide. KBR stock is forming a base.




KBR, which was spun out of **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), had focused on oil and gas markets until 2006. It now offers services like supply-chain management and heavy equipment transport to aerospace, defense and industrial businesses.


For example, on April 6, KBR said it had completed its private astronaut training for the upcoming Axiom Mission 1 to visit the International Space Station.


On March 24, KBR and **ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) said they would collaborate to work on advancing the process to convert propane into propylene — the basic feedstock for many plastics and other products.


And on March 15, KBR updated its 2025 long-term financial targets to factor in expected benefits from the HomeSafe alliance joint venture.


The partnership, between KBR and Tier One Relocation, secured a contract in November 2021 to improve the Department of Defense's military and civilian personnel's domestic and international relocation services. KBR holds a 72% ownership stake in HomeSafe.


The contract, with a ceiling value of $20 billion, is expected to boost KBR earnings. KBR has lifted its 2025 guidance, expecting sales to reach $9.5 billion, up 19% from the earlier expectation of $8 billion. The company sees adjusted EPS of $4.75 in 2025.

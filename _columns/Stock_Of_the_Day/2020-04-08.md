Qualys is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the cybersecurity firm nears an entry point while its relative strength shoots up. Qualys stock has climbed amid views that many existing customers will upgrade to a new, broader security vulnerability management platform.




Shares in Foster City, Calif.-based Qualys touched an [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 94.82 in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/?) before pulling back a bit. Shares ended the trading session up 6.8% to 95.50. Volume was tracking below the stock's average, a sign of weakness for the breakout attempt.


Qualys owns a Relative Strength Rating of 93 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. An [upward-trending RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tells you the stock is outperforming the general market.


Further, Qualys' technical and fundamental outlook was discussed on [IBD Live today](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&src=A00433A&refcode=pdsoc%7Cggl%7Cibdlive%7C2019%7C11%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C985802&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2019%7C11%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C682843). The technical chart of Qualys has formed a V-shaped short cup base somewhat akin to **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), another cybersecurity stock.

Qualys Stock: Revenue Re-Acceleration Key
-----------------------------------------


Qualys stock has an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) of B. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Qualys sells security vulnerability management services. Its security tools enable customers to identify risks and meet regulatory compliance.


In March, Qualys introduced its Vulnerability Management Detection and Response tools, or VMDR. They combine multiple security products into an integrated platform.


"VMDR aims to be a single application which marries Qualys' scanning, vulnerability configuration, prioritization and patch management capabilities," Morgan Stanley analyst Melissa Franchi said in a report to clients.


The tools could help Qualys stock by re-accelerating revenue growth. In 2019, sales rose 15% to $322 million, slowing from 21% growth the year earlier.


Franchi added: "It's still in its early days and the company will need to ramp sales and marketing around the new release to raise awareness in a crowded market."


VMDR Platform Gaining Traction
------------------------------


Qualys stock analysts report the company sees marketing and increased research and development impacting profit margins.


In the December quarter, profit rose 25% to 64 cents a share, slowing from 59% per-share earnings growth in the year-earlier period.


Qualys showcased the VMDR platform at a meeting in early March in San Francisco.


"VMDR is gaining traction within the existing customer base, as the company has already transitioned 24 customers to VMDR, generating total bookings of about $7.3 million," Cowen analyst Nick Yako said in his note to clients. "Management also mentioned it has provided 576 VMDR quotes to prospective VMDR customers representing total bookings of about $24.8 million."


Yako added: "While we expect initial transitions/uptake of VMDR to be largely revenue neutral given early customers will likely be existing customers, we are encouraged by the initial reception of VMDR and believe it highlights the need for an end-to-end vulnerability management solution in the market."


Qualys Stock: Recurring Revenue Business Model
----------------------------------------------


Also, Yako noted that existing customers accounted for about 96% of Qualys revenue in 2019. He says the recurring revenue model will be a bright spot for Qualys stock as corporate spending slows amid the coronavirus emergency.


While Qualys rolled out VMDR to some customers, it plans "general availability" for mid-April, said Tami Casey, a company spokesperson, in an email.


VMDR also serves as a foundation for Qualys to expand into the incident response market. Analysts say Qualys is developing security information and event management, or SIEM tools, that analyze huge volumes of network data and automate responses.

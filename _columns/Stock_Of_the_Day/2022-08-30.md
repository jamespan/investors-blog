**Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). It's one of several solar energy stocks investors are piling into thanks to the recently approved Inflation Reduction Act, which authorizes $369 billion in spending on green energy. ENPH stock has been trading at higher levels for several weeks now.




The Fremont, Calif.-based company is a leading provider of solar microinverters. Microinverters boost solar energy production, improve reliability in solar energy systems and support intelligent energy management.


Enphase also makes software to monitor energy generation and battery systems. The company focuses primarily on residential markets.


After a period of volatility in June and July, Enphase stock currently trades near its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It's key to see if it can rebound powerfully from the 21-day line and forge a new base.

The 21-day exponential moving average places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. It's a preferred choice when it comes to short-term swing trading. The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) is better suited for identifying medium-term direction.

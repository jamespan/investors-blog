**Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as more people buy generators, bracing for power outages from winter storms or summer forest fires. Generac stock powered past two early buy points Monday as it moves toward the top of a flat base.




At the end of October, the Wisconsin-based maker of power generation equipment and other products reported Q3 earnings of $2.08 per share, a 45% jump from the year-ago period. It was the second straight quarter of accelerating Generac earnings growth. Revenue popped 17% to $701.4 million, the best gain in six quarters.


"Third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA far exceeded all-time records led by dramatic growth in sales of home standby and portable generators," CEO Aaron Jagdfeld said in a statement. "Power outage activity was much higher during the quarter driven by more extreme and severe weather."


The residential products business, which includes the standby generators and portable models, grew 37% to $459 million in revenue. The commercial and industrial business saw sales drop 18% to $176 million.


Jagdfeld said Generac orders for standby generators are more than twice the number last year, while the company's backlog has continued to grow in the fourth quarter.


As a result, Generac is raising its prior guidance for revenue growth for full-year 2020. It now expects an increase of 10% to 12% compared to the prior year. This compares to the previous baseline guidance of 5% to 8% revenue growth.

Growth Through Acquisitions
---------------------------


Generac has made several strategic acquisitions in recent months. In October, it bought Enbala Power Networks, entering the emerging market for grid services. In September, it entered the battery-powered commercial mower market with its Mean Green Products purchase. Earlier this year, it bought Energy Systems, its industrial distributor in Northern California.


Generac has also benefited from consumers' increased attention on improving their homes since the onset of the pandemic earlier this year. While solar installations slowed due to pandemic restrictions and social-distancing rules, generator sales rose.


"Demand for home standby generators reached unprecedented levels during the quarter," Jagdfeld said.

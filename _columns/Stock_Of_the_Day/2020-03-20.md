**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), a company uniquely positioned to perform well across the board due to changes in consumer behavior during the coronavirus pandemic. Amazon stock has held up relative to overall market conditions.




The reason is simple: Consumers are spending more of their time and money shopping online in order to avoid crowds. This includes items that are out of stock at their local supermarket. Besides, state and local authorities want consumers to remain indoors as much as possible.


Amazon has been expanding the size of its e-commerce services for years, to include the timely expansion into grocery deliveries. In addition, it continues to build warehouses and other operations in order to bring one-day delivery to its customers with its well established Amazon Prime rewards program.


Moreover, it's the market leader in cloud computing services, which has become increasingly vital to the support and expansion of business operations, at a time when anything nonessential is being abandoned.

The company also has a big play in music and video streaming services, which are looking increasingly attractive as hundreds of millions of people stay indoors.


Positive Aspects Of Amazon Stock
--------------------------------


Amazon stock reflects those advantages. Shares held up remarkably well relative to sharp plunges with most stocks across the board.


Buying stocks in a bear market comes with a high risk. It's wiser for investors to place well-performing stocks on their watchlist for further evaluation.


What makes Amazon an appropriate candidate to watch is its relative strength line, which has moved into record territory.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.


Leading up to the stock market plunge, Amazon stock hit a record high of 2,185.95 on Feb. 11. In the following weeks, as the damage inflicted by the coronavirus became more severe, Amazon stock dropped to a one-year low of 1,626.03, down 34%. During the same period the S&P 500 was down 30%


Since hitting that 52-week low, Amazon stock has rebounded about 15%, while the S&P 500 is up only about 2% from its bottom.


Amazon stock is currently treading close to its 200-day moving average, a positive indicator. The stock briefly traded above its [50-day moving averag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/)e on Friday, then pulled back.


Amazon stock dropped 1.9% to close at 1,846.09 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Outperforming 99% Of Stocks
---------------------------


The stock has a strong [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 out of a best-possible 99. The rating means Amazon stock currently outperforms 99% of all stocks. That's in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


In addition, the stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94. The rating tracks market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks.


When looking for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), focus on those with rising relative price strength.


Amazon currently holds the No. 1 ranking in IBD's Retail-Internet group. It's followed by China e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), then **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), another China e-commerce leader.


Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein on Friday reiterated his rating of outperform on Amazon stock. He maintained a price target of 2,400.


"Covid-19 is driving widespread demand for essentials, combined with increased e-commerce usage from 'social distancing' and 'shelter-in-place' programs," Helfstein wrote in a note to clients. "While some items are taking longer to be delivered, and grocery delivery capacity is strained, we think Amazon is seeing record consumer demand, with share gains likely to remain post virus."

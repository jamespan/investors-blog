Oil and gas machinery company **Now Inc.** ([DNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNOW)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it carves the right side of a new base. This is the latest among many setups for hot stocks in the oil and gas industry as prospects have increased in tandem with rising oil prices.




Now Inc. Stock Action
---------------------


After finding support at its 50-day moving average last week, Now Inc. stock rose 0.1% to 16.88 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/), and 9.5% below a consolidation buy point of 18.66 in a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/).


When a stock builds a base, seeing more days with heavy buying (accumulation) than heavy selling (distribution) is a positive sign.


Today's Stock Of The Day is not yet seeing accumulation after finding a floor of support just above the 15 price level.



Stock Of The Day: Hot Oil And Gas Stock
---------------------------------------


However, the distributor of [oil and gas drilling and production equipment](http://www.distributionnow.com/) spiked 13.4% and 14.4% in [heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/) after each of its last two quarterly reports.


Now Inc. stock won't issue its next quarterly results for a while, but 2018 earnings are projected to hit 31 cents a share, reversing from a loss of 27 cents a share in 2017. And analysts project a big EPS bump to 64 cents a share in 2019.


Because Now Inc. stock just returned to profitability only three quarters ago, it has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 71 out of 99. The Composite Rating looks at key fundamental and technical metrics like [earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/), profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.

Oil And Gas Industry Turnaround
-------------------------------


But the industrywide turnaround for oil and gas is notable, helping today's Stock Of The Day rise 53% so far in 2018. And many [other hot stocks in the sector](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/refinery-stocks-valero-marathon-petroleum-hollyfrontier-buy-points/) have seen strong share-price gains amid a recovery in profits.


Oil and gas machinery peer **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) moved above a 37.48 buy point intraday for the fourth time in five sessions. But Cactus once again failed to close above the entry point, reversing lower to finish down 2.1% at 36.52. The February IPO has nearly doubled since going public at 19.

**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the automaker forges ahead with plans to unveil an ambitious lineup of electric vehicles even as a chip shortage slows production. GM stock rose, flashing multiple buy signals.




GM delivered strong Q4 earnings, posting EPS of $1.93 vs. 5 cents in the year-ago quarter, on a sales bounce of 22% to $37.5 billion. But the company also warned of a cash flow hit in 2021 due to a chip shortage and higher material costs affecting the broader industry.


The U.S. carmaker plans to invest $7 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles this year and $27 billion by 2025. It looks to launch 30 new EVs. On Monday, it announced its plans to launch a new all-electric Chevy Bolt. The redesigned hatchback will start at under $34,000 and could be available by summer. A new crossover at the same price point is also in the works.


The vehicles are the first in a lineup of affordable EVs. GM also plans to unveil its Hummer EV by fall at a cost of $100,000. And by late 2021, GM expects to deliver its first EV600 commercial van to FedEx.


GM has also said it plans to phase out the sale of ICE light vehicles by 2035. Wall Street responded positively.


Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas recently adjusted his long-term earnings forecasts for GM, raising his 12-month price target to $80 vs. $57 previously, for nearly 57% upside.


GM Stock
--------


Shares rose 2.4% to 52.54 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). GM stock is getting support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). General Motors is just 3.8% above its 10-week line, well within range.


GM stock also moved above its 21-day exponential moving average on Monday, while just breaking a short trend line.


Arguably, General Motors stock has been consolidating since late January. Getting above resistance near 57 also would offer a buying opportunity.


The one caveat is that you'd like to see higher volume as shares rebound.


GM, which was added to the IBD [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) today.


[GM stock](https://www.investors.com/research/gm-stock-buy-now/) soared in October and November, when it announced its Hummer EV launch and stepped-up production. But shares then pulled back when it said it dramatically scaled-back its deal with EV startup Nikola. 


Then GM stock regained momentum amid news on Jan. 19 that **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) had joined a new investment round in GM's Cruise autonomous vehicle unit. As a result, GM stock hit a new high of 57.05 on Feb. 8, even as it reported a chip shortage would slow production.


GM stock has an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 82 of a possible 99. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which shows how GM stock performs vs. the S&P 500 index, has been going sideways the last few weeks, but has improved dramatically since July, when it hit a historic low.


**Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), which has also made a big push into EVs, rose 2.4% to 11.98. Ford stock briefly cleared buy points of 12.14 and 12.35 last week but pulled back with the broader market.


EV stocks are on the move today. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rose 6.4%, as the stock has fallen below its 50-day moving average and is well off a high of 900.40 intraday on Jan. 25. China-based rivals **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) surged 8.7% ahead of its earnings late Monday. **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) rose 4.1% and **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) was up 1.9%.


Tesla and Ford also had to pause production in recent weeks due to chip shortages. [Tesla shut down](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-production-top-selling-model-3-electric-vehicle-halted/) production at its Fremont, Calif.-factory for two days last week, said CEO Elon Musk. That followed a shutdown in 2020 from Dec. 24 to Jan. 11. In January, Ford shut down a Louisville, Ky., plant due to chip shortages. It said at the time that the closure was temporary but that the problem would be an ongoing one for months to come.

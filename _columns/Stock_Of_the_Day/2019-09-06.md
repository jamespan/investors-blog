**Epam** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) stock is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as it builds the right side of a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) to get closer to a potential breakout.




The stock has made a remarkable run since its 2012 debut on the NYSE. It has rallied 68% this year through Thursday's close, well ahead of the S&P 500's 19% year-to-date gain. Epam stock is up more than 1,500% from its $12 a share offering price.


The Newtown, Pa.-based provider of custom software engineering services was founded in 1993 by Arkadiy Dobkin in New Jersey and Leo Lozner in Belarus. It now has offices and software development centers on four continents — North America, Europe, Asia and Australia — and employs more than 30,000 workers.


Epam continues to grow earnings and sales, too. It's posted moderate double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines every year since its IPO. [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup) assigns the stock a 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics into a single score. That puts it at the top of the 42-stock tech services industry group. Epam is also a [Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).



One of the components of the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is the [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/). Epam gets a 97 EPS Rating, also among the best in the group. That reflects a five-year compound earnings growth rate of 19%. Analysts expect profit to rise 21% this year and 22% the next.


An A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) (sales + profit margins + return on equity) means Epam is in the top 20% of all stocks based on this measure. Highlights include 24% average sales growth the past three quarters. Epam also saw last year its best pretax margin (17.3%) and ROE (22.2%) in three years. Its ROE more than meets the 17% minimum typical of leading growth stocks.

A 1.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) reflects higher upside vs. downside volume.

Three highly regarded mutual funds — Columbia Acorn Fund (ACRNX), Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Wasatch Core Growth Fund (WGROX) owned shares in Q2. The number of fund shareholders jumped to 843 in the second quarter from 635 in the first quarter.

Epam stock is shaping the right side of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 201.10 potential buy point, according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks). It's roughly 4% away from the entry. The flat base, part of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), is second stage. Leading stocks tend to make their biggest runs after breaking out from such early-stage bases.


The market is back in a confirmed uptrend, which boosts the prospects of strong breakouts.

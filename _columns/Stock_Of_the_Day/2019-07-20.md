The [IBD Stock Of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) highlights top stocks that are in or near buy zones or perhaps flashing sell signals. Over the past few weeks, **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) has been a solid winner. On Friday, **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) soared, one of several recent cybersecurity stocks selected as Stock Of The Day. But some, like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Amarin** ([AMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMRN)) and **PagSeguro** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) have shown mixed action.




Inphi stock ran up to a profit-taking zone while CrowdStrike stock blasted out of a first-ever base on Friday. Meanwhile, Amarin stock soon fizzled, Amazon stock has barely moved since a breakout, while PagSeguro stock has continued to rise despite showing sell signals.


Here's a look at some of the winners and losers over the past month.



Inphi Stock
-----------


**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), meanwhile, was selected as [Stock Of The Day on July 1,](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/inphi-stock-breaks-out-easing-china-trade-tensions/) as U.S.-China trade relations appeared to thaw. The development sent Inphi stock surging that day past a 51.93 buy point from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).


On Thursday, the Inphi stock reached 20% from the entry point, putting the telecom gear chipmaker in profit-taking territory, MarketSmith analysis shows. Inphi stock sank 1.4% on Friday.



CrowdStrike Stock
-----------------


CrowdStrike stock looks like another winner. The cybersecurity firm was tapped as [Stock Of The Day on July 8](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/crowdstrike-stock-analysts-initiate-coverage-cybersecurity/), after analysts started coverage of the new IPO.


At the time, IBD noted CrowdStrike stock had formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) with a 79.89 buy point. On Friday, CrowdStrike stock leapt 15% to 83.52 Friday, breaking out powerfully to a record high. That came after [CrowdStrike raised guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-earnings-crwd-stock-q12019/) after reporting strong revenue growth.



Elsewhere in cybersecurity stocks, cloud-security provider **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and network security firm **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) have also done well, with modest gains.


Zscaler, [the Stock of the Day on July 3](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/zscaler-stock-nears-buy-point-as-microsoft-office-365-boosts-traffic/), has cleared an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/) with an 82.45 buy point, rising 0.4% on Friday. CyberArk, made the [Stock of the Day on July 11](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cyberark-stock-nears-buy-point-cybersecurity-leader/) after finding its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), has since built off that support, clearing a 138.83 buy point of a flat base on Monday. Shares dipped 0.2% Friday. Both Zscaler stock and CyberArk stock are in buy zones.



Amarin Stock
------------


Amarin stock, [July 2's Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amarin-stock-biotech-company-raises-guide-fda-mulls-high-triglycerides-treatment/), raced higher that day, up the right side of a cup-with-handle base. Those gains came as the biotech hiked its full-year sales forecast, on hopes for expanded FDA approval of Vascepa, its high triglycerides treatment.


At the time, IBD noted that aggressive investors could open up a position that that day, but the buy point was 23.35.


Meanwhile, [IBD's Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) added Amarin stock on July 2, seeing a high chance of short-term gains. [SwingTrader netted a 7.5% gain in two days](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/amarin-stock-swing-trading/), with profits taken at 5% and 10%.


In the three sessions after July 2, Amarin stock cleared the 23.35 entry but never closed above it. Then shares began to falter. By July 17, shares had fallen 7% from the 23.35 buy point, triggering an automatic sell.


On Thursday, Amarin stock plunged 10% on a planned $400 million public offering of American depositary shares, closing below its 50-day line. On Friday, shares lost 4.3%, breaking below their 200-day.



PagSeguro Stock Defies Sell Signals
-----------------------------------


One can hardly call PagSeguro stock a loser. The Brazilian payments stock, the [July 10 Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pagseguro-digital-stock-time-to-sell/), was flashing profit-taking signals after a breakout in May. IBD suggested investors take at least partial profits, due to the elevated risk of a pullback. But PagSeguro stock has kept running higher. Shares fell 0.7% on Friday.



Amazon Stock
------------


The biggest of recent picks, Amazon stock, has rallied modestly since it was [Stock Of The Day on June 26](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amazon-stock-nears-buy-point/). The article highlighted the e-commerce giant's set up near a 1,964.50 buy point from a long [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) pattern. But since the July 9 breakout, Amazon stock hasn't really made progress. Amazon stock fell 2.3% last week, closing at 1,964.52, just 2 cents above the buy point.


Several recent breakouts struggled in the latest week as the broader stock market pulled back. When the stock market falls, most individual names will retreat, no matter how promising the chart has looked.

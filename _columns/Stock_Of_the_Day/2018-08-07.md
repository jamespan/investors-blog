**Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) broke out to a new high on accelerating revenue growth and a raised outlook for the rest of 2018, though shares gave up much of their gains Tuesday.







After Monday's close, the company filed second-quarter earnings that helped the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock blow past a [flat-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) of 45.98. Etsy stock catapulted by more than 19% in morning trading, hitting an intraday high of 50.60.


But Etsy stock retreated sharply as the session wore on and closed at 43.84, up 3.3% on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Etsy is in a third-stage base, so a new breakout normally would have a smaller chance of making a big run. Yet, analysts were bullish on the latest results. Etsy received several stock-price increases from analysts Tuesday morning.

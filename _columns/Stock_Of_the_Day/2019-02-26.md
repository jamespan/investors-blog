"Cabot has been one of the more consistent performers as they are a consumable supplier rather than a capital equipment supplier and as such are based on wafer starts and layer count and not capital spend," Semiconductor Advisors said in a report last month.


However, with wafer manufacturing slowing recently, Cabot could be impacted, the firm said.


The common wisdom is that consumables companies like Cabot Microelectronics have more of a "Steady Eddy" type of business compared with chip-equipment manufacturers, the advisory firm said.


Cabot Earnings Top Views
------------------------


On Feb. 6, Cabot reported [fiscal first-quarter results](http://ir.cabotcmp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=120920&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2386457) that crushed Wall Street's targets. It earned an adjusted $1.90 a share on sales of $221.8 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.43 on sales of $196 million.


Sales to electronics manufacturing industries accounted for 86% of the company's revenue last quarter. The remaining 16% of revenue came from supplying materials to pipeline operators and the industrial wood preservation industry.

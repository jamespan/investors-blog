**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) eyes a fresh buy point as e-commerce sales ramp up and profits return amid a new alliance with **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), making it the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




MercadoLibre stock flies high in the internet retail group alongside the likes of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).


It seeks to become the Amazon of Latin America as Amazon itself looks to grow its presence in Latin America. Key markets include Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, which collectively represented 94% of MercadoLibre sales last year. MercadoLibre is benefiting from improving conditions in Argentina and Brazil, which have pro-market governments now.


The Buenos Aires-based company is investing heavily to expand and strengthen its e-commerce and logistics offerings. Meanwhile, internet retail and digital payments boom in the region.

Putting Money Back In Venture
-----------------------------


MercadoLibre provides an [online marketplace for merchants](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/mercadolibre-e-commerce-growth-latin-america/) and also hosts platforms where users can create online stores. It also handles shipping, money transfers, lending and online payments, recently winning a $750 million PayPal investment to grow its fintech businesses. It also makes money off advertising and classifieds.


MercadoLibre's investments to grow the business have come at the expense of profits, despite enviable sales.


Revenue has risen every year since 2010, topping $1 billion for the first time in 2017, and reaching $1.44 billion last year. Profit margins have fallen every year since 2010, falling to a low of 48.4% last year.


IBD Stock Of The Day Eyes Fresh Buy Point
-----------------------------------------


MercadoLibre stock rose 0.3% to 654.71 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), backing off intraday highs of 662.90. Shares have formed a new second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) on top of a rare [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/), with a buy point of 672.65.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is looking to make a new all-time high. It would be bullish if it makes a new high when the stock breaks out, or even before a breakout.


The RS line, the blue line in the chart above, tracks performance against the S&P 500. MercadoLibre stock has a superior [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 92, and a mediocre EPS Rating of 68.


With MercadoLibre earnings coming up, investors should exercise caution before buying the e-commerce stock. Even top growth stocks can gap down on disappointing earnings, which is why investors should at least consider an [options strategy to limit risk around earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/).


MercadoLibre Earnings Loom
--------------------------


Second-quarter MercadoLibre earnings are due Aug. 7. MercadoLibre should swing from a net loss of 25 cents a share to a profit of 28 cents a share, as sales vault 49% to $498 million, analysts say. That would be the third straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth and the best top-line gain in several year.


MercadoLibre earnings returned in the first quarter after five straight quarterly losses.


Analysts expect MercadoLibre earnings of $1.15 a share for all of 2019, after stumbling to a net loss of 82 cents per share in 2018. MercardoLibre earnings are likely to jump 170% to $3.11 in 2020.


MercadoLibre stock is ranked No. 6 in the internet retail group. The three top-rated e-commerce stocks in this group are Alibaba, Etsy and Amazon.


The group itself is ranked No. 42 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, earning a strong RS rating of A minus.

**Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as the provider of integrated payment processing announced a contactless QR code ordering solution for restaurants. Shift4 Payments stock, which had its IPO in June, blasted past a buy point Monday.




As restaurants continue to innovate to deal with pandemic restrictions, demand for services  like those offered by Shift4 have skyrocketed. Shift4 Payments sells credit card processing terminals and touch screen point-of-sale systems to restaurants and other merchants.


Shift4 Payments launched QR Pay earlier this year, allowing customers to pay through their phones for a touch-free payment experience.


Shift4's latest offering expands on that functionality by letting customers place orders via their phones as well, delivering a completely contactless dining experience. This solution provides restaurants with a custom QR code that can be displayed on table tents and placemats for customers to scan with their phone, view the menu and place their order. The order is sent directly to the restaurant's point-of-sale (POS) system so that it can be prepared and served like any other order.


Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman said in a press release, "Our QR code technology enables restaurants to provide their patrons with a touch-free dining experience that's secure, safe, and convenient."

Shift4 Fundamentals
-------------------


Revenue tumbled in the last quarter, largely due to widespread Covid-related closures related. Gross revenue for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 21% to $141.8 million from $180.5 million the year before, Net loss was $75.0 million or a loss of $0.03 per share.


But last Friday, Shift4 CEO Isaacman said in a press release that payment volume had begun to recover. "The hospitality industry typically experiences a seasonal volume decline in the fall," he said. "The seasonality was less pronounced in our data, with several states processing volume consistent with the prior month. These positive trends are very encouraging and indicate that business owners, and their patrons, are adapting to this challenging situation and embracing safe ways to engage in commerce."


Revenue had grown 34%, 30% and 29% in the prior three quarters.


The company has been losing money, but analysts expect Shift4 to turn a slim profit in Q3 and Q4, with clear profitability in 2021.

Semiconductor equipment maker **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the Dutch company is seeing high demand for its advanced lithography systems for making cutting-edge chips. ASML stock gapped up on Wednesday.




On the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), ASML stock jumped 6.3% to 325.64. Earlier in the session, it notched an all-time high of 326.26.


[IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) show ASML stock leaping into the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) from a 14-week [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 319.32 on Wednesday. However, alternate chart analysis shows ASML stock hit a handle entry point of 306 on Monday.


ASML stock is extended from that alternate entry point so taking a small position is more prudent than a full position, according to [IBD trading guidelines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/).

Bounces Back From Coronavirus Stock Market Crash
------------------------------------------------


ASML stock fell 40% in the coronavirus stock market crash from late February to late March before starting its recovery. In a positive sign, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is carving new highs as it outperforms the overall stock market.


On April 15, Netherlands-based ASML reported [first-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-earnings-q1-2020-asml-stock/) that missed expectations but said demand for its products remained strong. The company blamed business disruptions from the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic for missing its earnings target.


ASML opted not to give guidance for the second quarter and full year given uncertainties in the market.

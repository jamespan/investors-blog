QuinStreet Stock Technical Analysis
-----------------------------------


QuinStreet stock closed flat at 17.33 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), flirting for a second straight session with a 17.85 buy point. Shares are in a late-stage base-on-base pattern, having more than doubled in the past year. The [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) signals unusual strength during the recent stock market correction. A stock holding its ground and stepping modestly higher stands out in weak conditions.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/), which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, hit a new high Monday.


Investors should bear in mind that later-stage breakouts are more likely to fail, because the stock has already made a big move up.


QuinStreet Earnings Growth Has Ramped Up
----------------------------------------


QuinStreet boasts a best-possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99. It scores a mediocre [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 74. However, the company looks set to shake off its struggles to grow earnings for much of this decade so far.


QuinStreet earnings-per-share growth has averaged 120% over the past three quarters, part of an ongoing turnaround.


Over the past three years, [QuinStreet earnings growth is 357%](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/stocks-to-watch-after-275-run-stock-with-357-eps-growth-sets-up/). That largely reflects a massive surge in fiscal 2018, following little or no profit in fiscal 2015-2017.


Analysts expect earnings to vault 44% to 65 cents in 2019 and to jump 32% to 86 cents in 2020.


Sales growth has been in double digits for the past five quarters, though it has slowed in the past two quarters to a still-robust 29% in fiscal Q1 2019.

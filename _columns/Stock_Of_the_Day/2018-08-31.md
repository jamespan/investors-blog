Kylie Jenner had a [big announcement](https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/1035262385647366144) to make yesterday about her Kylie Cosmetics line, and the fanfare around that news is reportedly driving **Ulta Beauty**'s ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) rebound — making it the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




[Ulta's results didn't immediately impress](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-beauty-stock-buy-ulta-beauty-earnings/) late Thursday, with revenue only meeting views for $1.49 billion and same-store sales growth of 6.5% falling short of estimates. (Comps have moderated from the days of 14% or 16% same-store sales gains, achieved in 2016 and 2017.) Profit of $2.46 topped estimates by 6 cents a share.


But management said during the earnings call that it will be the exclusive retailer of Kylie Cosmetics, which will debut at Ulta Beauty in stores and online later in 2018. (Jenner concurrently made the announcement via Twitter, which has since been retweeted nearly 15,000 times.)


"Kylie Jenner is a highly influential force in the beauty industry," Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon told investors on the call. "This brand addition is yet another example of successful digitally-native brands valuing a brick-and-mortar partnership with Ulta Beauty to extend their reach with consumers."


Shares rallied 6.4% to 260 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Ulta stock hit a 13-month high intraday of 268.87 that briefly cleared a 261.50 entry point from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/). Ulta had been down as much as 6% in after-hours action Thursday.

What Kylie Cosmetics Is Worth To Kylie Jenner
---------------------------------------------


Kylie Cosmetics may just be a singular brand for Ulta, which carries a slew of popular cosmetics and skin care collections like Urban Decay, It Cosmetics, Too Faced, Mac and Drybar.


But its lip kits and other assorted products are estimated to be a $400 million brand and have an enormous social media influence, not to mention a history of [selling out within minutes](https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/news/a33867/kylie-jenner-new-lip-kits-sell-out-in-10-minutes/).


Kylie Cosmetics has also helped Kylie Jenner amass a [$900 million fortune in just three years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2018/07/11/how-20-year-old-kylie-jenner-built-a-900-million-fortune-in-less-than-3-years/).


A quick survey of the Twitterscape and media headlines points to fans "[freaking out](https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2018/08/kylie-cosmetics-is-headed-to-ulta-beauty-and-fans-are-freaking-out)," feeling "[shook](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/elaminabdelmahmoud/morning-update-kylie-jenner-is-coming-for-your-wallet)," and [getting ready to open their wallets](https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-cosmetics-ulta-beauty-stores-2018-8?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter).

Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy noted Thursday that Kylie Cosmetics has 17.2 million followers on Instagram, just a few million shy of MAC Cosmetics' 19.1 million. That's a huge social media following given the longevity of MAC and the relative newness of Jenner's brand.

On the call, management also called out "excellent growth" in expanding brands such as NARS, MAC, Clinique, Lancome, **Estee Lauder** ([EL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EL)), Morphe and Chanel Beaute. The company is also adding Kiehl's, a prestige skin care line, in the coming months.


Ulta says it is on target to have 1,400-1,700 stores in the U.S. in the coming few years. It now boasts 30 million members in its loyalty program.


As beauty products hold sway in this Instagram-focused age, rival Sephora continues to thrive. Parent LVMH in July highlighting the prestige beauty retailer's "strong revenue growth" both online and in stores.

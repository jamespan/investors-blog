**Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), a provider of medical devices with a broad product portfolio showing an offbeat cup-with-handle stock pattern.




Founded in 2004 and based in Alameda, Calif., Penumbra has shown consistent double-digit revenue growth per quarter going back more than four years. The company held its initial public offering in 2015.


Penumbra stock has a buy point of 155.87. A cautionary note to potential investors lies in the company's [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). Penumbra has a handle that is deeper than average, showing a decline of more than 20%, about double what is normal. Still, Penumbra stock on Tuesday soared above its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and 200 day moving averages, both positive indicators.


Penumbra stock climbed 2.7%, closing at 144.76 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The stock's record high is 167.35, set on June 1, 2018.

Penumbra Stock Ratings
----------------------


Penumbra has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 83 out of a best possible 99. That means it's outperforming 83% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.


Its [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) is 72 out of 99. That's up from 67 on Monday, a welcome improvement, but still shy of the 80 or higher score you look for.


The Relative Strength Rating reflects [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) performance by identifying how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks compares to the rest of the market.


Decades of market research shows that the best stocks often have an 80 or better RS Rating as they launch their biggest runs. See if Penumbra can continue to show renewed price strength and hit that benchmark.


Penumbra earns the No. 24 rank among its peers in the Medical-Products industry group, which includes 121 U.S. companies. **Quidel** ([ODEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODEL)) **Caredx** ([CDNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNA)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.


Penumbra makes and markets a range of medical devices that address challenging medical conditions and clinical needs across markets that include neurosurgical and peripheral vascular. This includes devices to treat strokes and blood vessel blockages. Its products are sold to hospitals primarily through a direct sales organization.


Fourth-Quarter Earnings Report
------------------------------


The company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 26 that beat Wall Street estimates, but Penumbra stock fell on the news.


Revenue rose 26% to $120.8 million, though that was the third quarter in a row of revenue deceleration. Adjusted earnings rose 30% to 13 cents a share.


For the year, revenue rose 33% to $444.9 million. This year, Penumbra expects revenue in the range of $525 million to $538 million. That would be an increase of 20% at the midpoint.


"We think Penumbra is well positioned, with multiple growth drivers," Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills wrote in a note to clients after the earnings report. "Penumbra possesses a compelling pipeline of growth opportunities in both existing target markets and new ones."


Mills maintained a buy rating on Penumbra stock and a price target of 160.

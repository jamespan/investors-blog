**Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) is [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the electronic design and testing company crushed earnings estimates and received several Wall Street price target hikes. Keysight stock shot into a buy zone.




Late Wednesday, Keysight earnings vaulted 40% to $1.25 per share as fiscal Q3 sales climbed 8% to $1.087 billion. Wall Street expected Keysight earnings per share of $1.02 on revenue of $1.045 billion.


After the results, Citi analyst Jim Suva wrote KEYS stock remains a top pick for 2019 and the company has "de-risked the China trade war situation." Cowen analyst Tim Long echoed the view, saying "meaningful trade war headwinds have (so far) not materialized."


Keysight Technologies: Early Stages Of 5G Growth
------------------------------------------------


Analysts also noted strong performance in the [5G wireless business](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/). Telecom companies are building out 5G wireless networks and 5G devices, with Keysight providing 5G testing gear. "The upside surprise in Commercial Comms increases our confidence in the sustainability of 5G driven growth, which remains in its early stages in our view," Long added.


Keysight offers "an agnostic way to invest in 5G in that an investor does not need to pick which OEM, vendor, or end product will gain or lose share in 5G," Citi's Suva said.


Citi raised its price target on Keysight stock to 115 from 110. Cowen hiked its price target to 110 from 103. Analysts at Jefferies and Deutsche also raised their targets.

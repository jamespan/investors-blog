**Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The recent oil equipment IPO is nearing a buy point as it finds support back above its 50-day line following earnings last week.




Cactus designs, manufactures and sells wellheads and pressure control equipment. The Houston-based company went public at 19 a share in early February.


Cactus Stock
------------


Shares jumped 3.5% to 34.64 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


Cactus stock is in a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base with a 37.48 buy point. Shares have moved back above the 50-day line, where they've often found support in recent weeks. In early July, Cactus stock attempted to break out past a 37.60 entry, but that quickly failed.


Oil prices have risen on global supply worries. On Monday, the Trump Administration left the Iranian Nuclear Agreement, reimposing sanctions on Iran's oil exports.



Cactus Earnings
---------------


On Wednesday, Cactus earnings came in at 46 cents per share, with revenue of $139 million. Both beat Wall Street estimates. Increased U.S. shale activity has fueled demand for Cactus equipment.


Highly rated shale exploration and production companies **Carrizo Oil & Gas** ([CRZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRZO)) and **Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) will report results late Tuesday. Carrizo Oil stock has a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) and Oasis stock has a 94 CR, meaning they are outperforming 98% and 94% of all stocks respectively.


The market's biggest winners often have a 95 or higher score and the rating is a key metric to consider for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


Cactus has an 87 Composite Rating and an 84 EPS rating. Cactus lost money in 2016, weighing on those key ratings, but has been increasingly profitable for several quarters. Its Relative Strength rating is 94.


**Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) and other shale producers will report later this week.


Realized price for oil produced has been a key concern for Wall Street due to bottlenecks in take-away capacity from the Permian region.

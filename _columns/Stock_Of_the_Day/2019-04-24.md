**Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)), an online trading platform and [recent IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Tradeweb stock is forming an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/).




According to [IBD research](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), IPO bases should generally form above a stock's debut price. The bases tend to last between seven days and five weeks.


The dip from the top of the base to the low point generally isn't greater than 20%. However, in particularly choppy markets, that descent can reach 50%.


Tradeweb Stock
--------------


Tradeweb stock reversed higher, rising 1.8% to close at 39.99 on the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today), after topping 40.00 intraday. The buy point of the IPO base is 44.35. That figure is 10 cents above the high that Tradeweb stock reached on April 15. Tradeweb went public on April 4, pricing at 27 and opening at 34.26.


Tradeweb stock has an IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 86, according to Marketsmith. Its [EPS Rating,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) a measure of accelerating profits, is a weaker 57. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), a gauge of its performance against the S&P 500, has fallen.

Tradeweb IPO Boasts Actual Profits
----------------------------------


Tradeweb's debut was sandwiched between much flashier IPOs, like ride-sharing service **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) and idea-sharing social media site **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)). However, unlike those two, Tradeweb came public with actual profitability.


Founded in 1996, Tradeweb allows traders to buy and sell bonds, derivatives and other financial instruments. The company also sells data services related to those trades. Its customers include hedge funds, central banks, financial advisors and insurance companies.


While stock trading has become more digitized, other products, like bonds and derivatives, haven't gone digital as quickly, in part due to their complexity. Tradeweb, which serves more than 2,500 clients in 62 countries, believes there's more room to grow as the online world seeps into those areas of trading.


"It's really this bigger point of just more and more focus that our customers have on reducing the costs and the friction in doing their business," [CEO Lee Olesky told IBD](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/tradeweb-ipo-tradeweb-stock/) in an interview this month. "So many of our markets are in the early to middle stages of actually digitizing."


Other Recent IPOs
-----------------


Among other IPOs, **Jumia** ([JMIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JMIA)), a large e-commerce site that serves Africa, hasn't quite formed an IPO base yet but appears on track to do so. Shares added 3.2% on Wednesday.


Pinterest rose 3.7% while Lyft lost 4%. **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), which provides videoconferencing services, tumbled 8.4%. Zoom [debuted on Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zoom-stock-ipo-trading-pinterest/).


Zoom was profitable for its last fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, after posting a net loss in the prior year. Jumia's operating loss deepened last year.

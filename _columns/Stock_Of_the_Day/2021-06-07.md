**Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as shipping demand for dry bulk goods explodes amid a reopening of the economy post-pandemic. SBLK stock is in buy range after bouncing off a key support level.




Greece-based Star Bulk Carriers owns and operates a global fleet focusing on the transportation of dry bulk cargoes. The company's vessels transport major bulks, including iron ore, coal and grain, as well as minor bulks such as fertilizers and steel products.


Star Bulk Carriers posted mixed first-quarter 2021 results. It had adjusted net income of $35.7 million, or 36 cents a share, swinging from a 23-cent loss in the year-ago period. Revenue grew 25% to $200.5 million, snapping a four-quarter string of sales declines. Analysts had expected EPS of 46 cents and revenue of $171.5 million, according to FactSet.


While Star Bulk missed earnings estimates, it was optimistic about its outlook for Q2. Daily time charter equivalent revenue (TCE), which is the average daily revenue performance of a vessel, hit $15,461 per vessel in Q1. Star Bulk Carriers expects that figure to grow to $21,168 in Q2, a 37% sequential increase.

"Our outlook for the market remains positive due to the reopening of the global economy and consequent increased demand across all key dry bulk commodities," CEO Petros Pappas said in an earnings call. "The record low order book, coupled with upcoming environmental regulations that limit new vessel orders, also create favorable long-term dynamics for our industry."


Worldwide marine shipping revenue is seen climbing 16% in 2021, after falling 2.6% in 2020, FactSet data shows.

Star Bulk Carriers Boosts Fleet
-------------------------------


Star Bulk CEO Pappas says the company has increased its fleet acquisition over the past 12 months. It acquired 12 vessels, nine of which were delivered in Q1.


"We expect to take delivery of the remaining three vessels during Q2," he said.


Star Bulk Carriers also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 30 cents to all shareholders of recordÂ as of May 3, 2021.


And while the pandemic is waning, Pappas cautioned that the future is still uncertain.


"The efficacy of any measures we take in response to the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic will depend on how the outbreak further develops, the duration and extent of the restrictive measures ... and their impact on global economy and trade."

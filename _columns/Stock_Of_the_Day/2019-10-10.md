**ASML Holding** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), a provider of equipment used for making semiconductors, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as ASML stock broke out to a new high on Thursday.




The Netherlands-based company is one of several large providers of chipmaking equipment, such as **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)). Altogether, they provide the various types of systems needed to build the complex circuitry of microelectronic devices.


Keep in mind that chip stocks currently are vulnerable to wild swings associated with the trade war with China. The semiconductor industry is also [notoriously cyclical](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-companies-semiconductor-industry/).


Founded 35 years ago, ASML has a market valuation of about $106 billion. ASML stock is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) list of top performing companies.

The company is expected to see a small decline in earnings this year, due in large part to trade war frictions. But Wall Street sees a strong rebound in profit in 2020, up 36% to $9.14 a share. The company reported [second quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-stock-q2-earnings-beat/) in July that topped expectations.


Analysis Of ASML Stock
----------------------


ASML stock climbed 2.3%, near 251.95, during afternoon trading on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), near a buy point of 252.21.


Shares hit an intraday record of 254.24 at one point in Thursday's session, breaking out briefly from a [three-weeks tight pattern,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) which followed a flat [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) and a long [cup-with-handle formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


The pattern indicates a pause in a stock's advance, which may give the impression it's stalling. On the contrary, it can produce powerful breakouts.


The three-weeks-tight is normally used to add a small amount of shares to a stock an investor already owns. New investors sometimes can make an initial purchase with this pattern. However, amid the current stock market volatility, investors should be cautious.


Another positive trend for ASML stock is its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which is at a record high. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Typically, the RS line of the strongest stocks is either confirming or leading a stock's price into new high ground.


Among other stock metrics, the [Relative Strength Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength) on ASML is a strong 96 out of a possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). That's a bullish signal. That means it has outperformed 96% of all stocks. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating. ASML also has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 89.


ASML is part of IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group, which ranks No. 15 out of 197 industry groups. The highest rated company in that group is **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), followed by Teradyne, then **Cabot Microelectronics** ([CCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCMP)). ASML is ranked No. 9.


Analyst Views On ASML
---------------------


UBS analyst David Mulholland has a buy rating on ASML stock and price target of 275.


"We view ASML as one of the highest quality names in European tech hardware and we expect solid growth and its competitive advantage to continue for the next decade, making disruption to the business model highly unlikely, a rarity in technology stocks globally," Mulholland wrote in a note to clients.


Despite the current down cycle in the semiconductor industry, a Wall Street firm last month turned positive [on chip equipment manufacturers](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/semiconductor-industry-wall-street-firm-upgrades-chip-gear-stocks/).


Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said he is "going all in on semi-equipment stocks." He upgraded KLA and Lam Research to outperform from in line. He also reiterated his buy ratings on Applied Materials and ASML**.**


"Obviously the macro backdrop, particularly uncertainty related to escalating trade tensions, would not appear to be ideal for owning higher-beta semiconductor production equipment stocks, but we believe there are both company and industry-specific catalysts that will lead the group higher into year-end," Muse wrote.

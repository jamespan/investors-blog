GSX Techedu Stock Technical Analysis
------------------------------------


GSX Techedu shares closed up 6.4% to 41.88 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), bouncing off a [test at the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) again. GSX Techedu staged a bullish rebound from its 50-day line a few weeks ago.


The stock has been strong before and after the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) and was able to maintain at that key support level while the broader market sold off hard. Even during a market correction, leading stocks tend to trade near or even above their 50-day moving averages.


The company has a perfect Relative Strength Rating of 99, according to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gsx-techedu-inc-cl-a-ads-gsx.aspx) tool, and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is back near all-time highs. GSX has a 92 Composite Rating and an 84 EPS Rating.


Competitor **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) closed up 5% Wednesday and **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) closed up 5.7%.


How To Play GSX Stock
---------------------


Shares are also approaching a potential buy point in a high tight flag. During this rare pattern, a stock often more than doubles in four to eight weeks. Then it consolidates 10% to 25% over three to five weeks. GSX is close to those dimensions, which means a buy point could exist at 46.50.


But investors should wait for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) to confirm a new uptrend before buying stocks again. Most follow-through rallies happen on the fourth day or later of a new uptrend.


When GSX Techedu forms a follow-through day, investors should take a small stake because it is likely that the first follow-through day will fail based on historical charts. But investors can take bigger stakes in subsequent follow-throughs.


Until that happens, however, investors should be cautious and not buy stocks during a market downturn. Instead, investors should keep top stocks on watchlists to buy when the market rebounds.

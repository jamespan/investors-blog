**Expedia Group** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE))Â is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the online travel giant is benefiting from the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions and barriers. Expedia stock is near a buy point.




The White House said Friday it would allow international travelers who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 into the U.S. starting Nov. 8. The move lifts a ban on visitors from the European Union, the U.K. and other countries.


Expedia stock climbed 1.8% to close at 171.99 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). It has formed a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a buy point of 175.47. The top end of the buy range is 184.24, after which Expedia stock would be extended. A stock is considered to be extended when it's 5% above [the proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).


The stock-chart pattern of Expedia is currently comparable to online travel giant **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), which is currently in a buy zone.

Expedia Stock Was In Free Fall
------------------------------


Expedia stock went into free fall in March 2020 as the pandemic kicked into high gear, spurring one of the toughest periods the travel industry has ever faced.


Travel spending plunged 42%, or $500 billion, from 2019 to 2020, according to the U.S. Travel Association. International travel plummeted 76%, while business travel fell 70%, it said.


In addition to the online travel companies seeing the light of day after a long down period, **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **United Airline**s ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), as well as hotel and casino plays, are coming back. But these companies have struggled to return to profitability with international travel curbed for more than 18 months.


Travel is an increasingly competitive market with multiple companies in on the action. In addition to Expedia and Booking Holdings, there's **Sabre** ([SABR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SABR)), **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)), **Trivago** ([TRVG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRVG)) and **TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)).


Second-Quarter Jumped 270%
--------------------------


Expedia, for its second quarter, reported a 270% jump in revenue to $2.1 billion, compared with the year-ago period. But it has six quarters in a row of losses.


The company said it benefited from strong vacation rental performance and improved conventional lodging. But that was offset by continued softness in international travel and corporate travel, and relatively high consumer interest in lower-end accommodations.


Booking trends for lodging, air and other travel products all improved sequentially from the first quarter of 2021. However, the company also warned that the Covid-19 delta variant continues to create uncertainty in the travel industry, and for Expedia stock.


"Unfortunately, the road to full travel recovery remains bumpy until more of the world is vaccinated," said Chief Executive Peter Kern, in a statement with the [Expedia earnings release.](https://www.expediagroup.com/investors/financial-information/quarterly-results/default.aspx)


Expedia reports third-quarter results on or around Nov. 4.

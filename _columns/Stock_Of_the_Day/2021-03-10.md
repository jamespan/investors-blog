**CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the fertilizer maker flashes an entry point and investors show an affinity for down-to-earth stocks. The Deerfield, Ill.-based company, like rivals **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) and **Intrepid Potash** ([IPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPI)), is benefiting from a surge in prices for fertilizers amid constrained supply as the farm economy shows strength.




CF stock is part of the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) portfolio. [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/), which aims to rack up small wins that add up to big overall gains, added CF stock on March 8.


Bull Market For Agriculture Stocks
----------------------------------


In its Feb. 17 Q4 earnings announcement, CF Industries noted that prices for urea, a nitrogen fertilizer, at the start of February were up 40% from December and 60% from a year ago.


Prices are being fueled by strong demand, as high corn prices encourage high-acreage production in the U.S. Meanwhile, higher input prices in Europe and China have held down supply.


Following the Q4 report, BMO Capital Markets analyst Joel Jackson hiked his full-year 2021 EPS estimate to $3.29 from $1.64. In 2020, CF earnings fell 34% to $1.47 a share. Jackson hiked his CF Industries price target to 54 from 49, keeping an outperform rating.


While noting that urea prices could see a seasonal peak in Q2, Jackson wrote that "CF's FCF (free cash-flow) generation is too attractive to pass up."


Management noted in a March 3 Bank of America investor presentation that the recent freeze that hit Texas and Louisiana added to supply constraints.


CF Stock Analysis
-----------------


CF stock rose 2.5% to 49.33 in Wednesday's stock market action. That's back above a 48.98 buy point from an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/). That rare pattern, which follows an earlier breakout, comprises three pullbacks, each with higher highs and higher lows.


CF stock wavered on either side of the buy zone on Wednesday. The fertilizer stock's entry point also is actionable as long as it holds above a down-sloping trend line from its Feb. 24 high to its close on March 5, which saw it bounce off its 10-week moving average.


On a weekly chart, CF stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which tracks its performance vs. the S&P 500, is hitting its highest level since January 2020.



The Chemicals-Agricultural industry group has had a middling performance overall, ranked No. 100 of 197 IBD industry groups. Still, some fertilizer stocks have hit 52-week highs in recent weeks, including Mosaic, Intrepid Potash and **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)).


Green Hydrogen Future
---------------------


Fertilizer pricing dynamics are surely driving the rise in CF stock. Yet the company's move to position itself as a green hydrogen play could extend its mileage.


On Oct. 29, CF Industries announced a green ammonia project at its Donaldsonville, La., complex. "The world needs clean energy, and hydrogen is a key to meeting this need. Low-carbon ammonia is the critical enabler for storage and transport of hydrogen and thus has a major role to play," CEO Tony Will said in a statement.


The project will produce roughly 20,000 tons per year of green ammonia, powered by renewable energy resources. The company also announced carbon capture and storage efforts as part of its plan to cut company emissions by 30% by 2030.

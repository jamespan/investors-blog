Upscale retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is the [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as homeowners continue to furnish their homes after a pandemic year that saw brisk home sales. RH stock is near a buy point.




RH posted impressive first-quarter sales and revenue growth. EPS soared 285% to $4.89 a share, above estimates for $4.03. Revenue surged 78% to 860.79, also beating estimates for $752 million. RH's operating margin shot up 14.5 percentage points to 21.8%.Â 


RH now sees Q2 sales climbing 35%-37% vs. analyst views for a 26% gain. Full-year sales should climb 25%-30% vs. its prior target for 15%-20%. The company also gave bullish operating margin guidance for Q2 and the year.


"You should also rest assured that we have pressure-tested our business assumptions and risks and are confident in our ability to maintain an adjusted operating margin in excess of 20% in just about any economic downside scenario we can envision," said CEO Gary Friedman in a letter to shareholders.

RH appears to be resilient to market swings because it caters to wealthy shoppers who are less exposed to economic downtrends.


Indeed, the pandemic has seen a spike in sales of second and vacation homes, which in turn need to be furnished as well. A recent National Association of Realtors study found that from January to April 2021, vacation home sales jumped 57.2% year-over-year vs. 20% growth in total existing-home sales.


"The appeal of vacation homes has certainly grown during the pandemic, especially among employees permitted to work from home," said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun in a statement. "As businesses decide new guidelines for remote workers, even allowing permanent remote options in some cases, look for vacation homes to remain a popular option."

**RH Stock**
------------


Shares of the Corte Madera, Calif.-based company dipped 0.2% to 689.37 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/). RH stock is closing in on a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 719.87 from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


The handle formed after RH stock gapped up earlier this month on Q1 earnings, then retreated over a few sessions to its 50-day line. Shares are trending higher again.


The company's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending upward. Its [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 90 out of a possible 99. RH's [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is 98, as it has posted four straight quarters of earnings growth.


One area of concern is that [housing-related stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/housing-stocks-outlook-may-be-determined-in-next-few-months/), including both builders and retailers, have been in a slump lately. That may reflect consumers shifting some spending from the home to apparel, restaurants, travel and services.


Rival upscale retailer **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) edged up 0.15% to 159.49. WSM stock is down 18% from its 52-week high of 194.69 achieved intraday on May 10.


Meanwhile, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) rose 0.2% to 314.28, and is well below its high of 345.69, notched intraday on May 10. HD stock has a buy point of 345.79 from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/).


Both WSM stock and Home Depot are trading below their 50-day moving averages, unlike RH.


However, borrowing rates remain low and lumber costs have halved from their recent highs. Wall Street analysts say that bodes well for a rebound among housing stocks in general.


**Galleries Expansion**
-----------------------


RH differentiates itself though its gallery-like retail stores. It plans to open a gallery in Paris in the fall of 2022 on the famed Champs-Elysees. RH has also secured five locations in London, Munich and Dusseldorf, Germany.


While many retailers have cut back the number of physical stores in favor of an expanded online presence, CEO Friedman has bucked the trend.


"Even though there's kind of a migration online, you've really got to be careful in today's world not to look at the channels independently," he said in an earnings call. "I really would caution any retailer who's doing that. I think it's a foolish way to look at a business because ... we're physical beings living in a physical world. And being able to see brands ... in a physical manner, being able to understand how big they are, what their assortment is, what they stand for, what the quality is like, what the taste and style is like is, I think, critical."

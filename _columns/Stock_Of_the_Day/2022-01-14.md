Farm machinery maker **Deere & Co.** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) is Friday's [**IBD Stock Of The Day**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), as it recently unveiled its autonomous tractor at CES. Deere stock nears a buy point.




Deere's fully autonomous tractor uses hybrid technologies including cameras, GPS and various AI programs. The goal is to give farmers the ability to put the tractor to work and go do something else, whether it's other farm tasks, time with family or even working off the farm, said D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Shlisky in a Jan. 7 note to clients. 


"Overall, we viewed the event as a positive for DE, as it has the potential to offer significant SaaS/recurring-revenue opportunities that could offset some of the potential impact of long-term Ag trends away from grains," Shlisky wrote.


On the other hand, inflation in the costs of labor, land, chemicals, or other inputs could curb farmers' ability to spend on equipment, such as Deere machinery. Higher interest rates, which the Fed seems poised to implement, also will make it more expensive for farmers or other key end-users to purchase Deere equipment.


If interest rates do rise, Deere's "sales and earnings could fall short of expectations," Shlisky wrote. "In addition, higher rates could lead to more past-due or defaulted equipment loans for DE."


**Deere Earnings**
------------------


Meanwhile, Deere has posted five straight quarters of earnings growth, four of them triple-digit gains. The Moline, Ill.-based company also reported four quarters in a row of revenue increases.


Looking ahead, FactSet analysts expect earnings to tumble 41.8% year over year to $2.25 a share, while revenue edges up 1.8% to around $8.2 billion. Deere reports its fiscal first quarter earnings on Feb. 18.

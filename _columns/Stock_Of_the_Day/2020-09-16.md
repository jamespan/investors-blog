**KE Holdings** ([BEKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEKE)), a China-based real-estate brokerage and technology company and a recent IPO, is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). KE Holdings stock is breaking out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) on Wednesdsay, as other real estate stocks trade more tightly, while the U.S. threatens more scrutiny of Chinese listings.




The company, which went public last month, hopes to make housing purchases, rentals and other transactions more efficient through digitization and standardization, as the nation's housing market grows in the years ahead.


KE Holdings turned profitable during the first half of this year, bucking the trend of other money-losing IPOs. And it put up sales growth of around 61% last year. Wall Street expects a jump in earnings growth next year.


However, IPOs can be choppy in the weeks following their debuts. And with the market uptrend under pressure, IBD advises investors to be cautious about buying stocks under those conditions.

KE Holdings Stock
-----------------


KE Holdings stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 13. The stock shot higher. Then, it touched a high of 54.60 this month and cooled off. The IPO base that has since formed has a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 54.70. Shares jumped 12% to 60.72 in the [stock market today](https://investors.com/stock-market-today), shooting through the chase zone, which extends to 57.44.


KE Holdings stock has an 89 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). It has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 39. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were among the underwriters for the IPO. Chinese internet giant **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) is one of KE Holdings' backers.


KE Holdings is the product of Lianjia, a real estate brokerage in China, and Beiki, a digital platform for housing transactions. A [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ke-holdings-shares-are-off-to-a-flying-start-in-ipo-debut-that-raises-212-billion-2020-08-13?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo) story last month compared the company to both **Re/Max** ([RMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMAX)) and **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)).


The company said it has built an online house listing and information system in China, and digitized other offline data, according to its IPO prospectus. The company said it "facilitated" more than 2.2 million housing transactions on its platform overall last year.


As of June 30, it said, that platform had more than 260 real estate brokerage brands, and more than 456,000 agents across more than 100 cities in China.


KE Holdings earned 1 cent per share over the first half of the year, following losses going back to at least 2017. Revenue last year came in at $6.5 billion. The company this year had made around $3.9 billion in sales as of June 30.


For the full year, Wall Street expects the company to earn 40 cents a share. Analysts expect earnings to jump 75% next year.

'Underdeveloped' Market
-----------------------


As KE Holdings stock goes public, the company hopes to bring more infrastructure to what it said was a fragmented, "underdeveloped" market for housing transactions in China, where brokerage-service providers often lacked experience.


"For example," KE Holdings said in the prospectus, "the lack of an industrywide listing inventory similar to the Multiple Listing Service ('MLS') in the United States makes it challenging for housing customers and agents to easily access reliable and authentic property listings."


"As a result," the prospectus continued, "duplicate or fraudulent property listings with inaccurate or outdated property and pricing information are common in the market."


But KE Holdings stock faces a tough environment. The company said the coronavirus crisis weighed on revenue in the first quarter. But it said business "quickly recovered" in the second quarter.


"People are increasingly demanding higher standards of living condition, and the demand is further strengthened by the COVID-19 pandemic," the prospectus said.


However, the Trump administration has also proposed a plan to delist Chinese companies from the big U.S. exchanges if they don't comply with auditing standards by 2022.


"The recommendations outlined in the report will increase investor protection and level the playing field for all companies listed on U.S. exchanges," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement last month.


Combative Stance
----------------


The proposal is part of the Trump administration's combative stance toward China, which it has accused of unfair trade practices, along with trade and data theft. The White House, citing security concerns, also threatened to ban social video platform TikTok unless ByteDance, TikTok's owner, found a way to sell it in the U.S.


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) this week said it was "part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department over the weekend in which Oracle will serve as the "trusted technology provider" for TikTok. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) said ByteDance had told it "they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft."


The SEC this year also began investigating other IPOs out of China, like Luckin Coffee and **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)), over their accounting practices. Those investigations came after short-sellers accused both companies of inflating their financials.


Luckin, a coffee chain in China, this year disclosed that an investigation found that some transactions had been fabricated last year, inflating the company's revenue. The company later fired its CEO and COO. GSX has faced multiple attacks from short-sellers, but has called the reports false and erroneous.

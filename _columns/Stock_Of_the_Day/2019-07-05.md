**Revolve Group** ([RVLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVLV)), an online fashion retailer, is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Revolve Group stock, which went public in June, is setting up its first-ever buy point from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/), with shares surging Friday. Sales growth is solid and, unlike higher-profile IPOs this year, Revolve is already profitable.




Revolve Group IPO
-----------------


The company, ahead of its June 7 debut, offered 11.8 million shares at 18, at the upper end of its expectations. Shares took off on their first day of trading, touching a high of 48.36 on June 19. The stock quickly cooled off after that, settling into an IPO base with a 48.46 buy point.


When a company begins trading, hype and hypersensitivity to any bad news can send its stock uppercutting through the roof one day or flailing lower the next. But buying opportunities can emerge if an IPO settles into tighter trading patterns.


According to IBD research, IPO bases [tend to start within 25 days of a stock's debut](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). The ones that present the biggest buying opportunities tend not to fall more than 20% from their highs. IPO bases can be as short as five days. They tend to last less than five weeks.

Shares vaulted 11% to 38.60 in the [stock market today](http://investors.com/stock-market-today). Revolve Group stock has a not-great [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 50 out of a best-possible 99. The stock's [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measures a company's ability to grow profits, stands at 40.


**RealReal** ([REAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REAL)), another online retailer that just went public, added 4% to 26.51 on Friday. Fast-growing, unprofitable RealReal sells real, consigned luxury goods. The RealReal IPO priced at 20, shot up 62% in its June 28 debut, hitting 30.05 intraday, but hit a post-IPO low of 25.06 on Tuesday.


Revolve Group Earnings
----------------------


Revolve Group sales for the quarter ending March 31 jumped 21% to $137.3 million, though that was the second straight quarter of slowing growth. Sales grew 20% last year to $498.7 million.


Revolve Group earnings came in at 7 cents a share pro forma in the March quarter, down 13% vs. a year earlier. But Wall Street expects Revolve earnings to rise 27% in 2019 and 29% in 2020.


Revolve Group, founded in 2003, pitches itself as a "trusted, premium lifestyle brand" for millennials and Generation Z customers. The company sells clothing, footwear and accessories and says it has relationships with "thousands" of social-media influencers that can connect with millions of consumers.


Digital Focus
-------------


Revolve, in its prospectus, also touts what it called its trend-forecasting algorithms and a broader data-heavy approach to anticipating consumer tastes than rivals. That technology, it said, harnesses data from "hundreds of thousands of styles, up to 60 attributes per style, and millions of customer interactions."


"Our technology enables us to automate the rapid identification of new trends and emerging brands, allowing us to offer a vast and diversified product assortment that does not rely on any given trend or style and has minimal overlap with other retailers," the company said in its prospectus.


Still, the company noted, the retailers it competes against are often much bigger.


"Many of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, faster shipping times, lower-cost shipping, larger databases, greater financial, marketing, institutional and other resources and larger customer bases than we do," Revolve's prospectus said.

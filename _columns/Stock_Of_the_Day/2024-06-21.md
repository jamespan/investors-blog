Domino's Pizza stock is the [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as it eyes a buy point and early entry, near a multiyear high. **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) saw earnings sharply accelerate in the first quarter and has found key support in recent weeks.


TD Cowen reaffirmed a buy rating on shares of Domino's Pizza in a research note on Thursday, FactSet shows. The firm upped its price target to $610. In fact, more than a dozen analysts hiked their price targets on Domino's stock after the pizza chain delivered [strong earnings and guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/dominos-stock-earnings-outlook/) on April 29.


Among restaurant peers, **McDonald**'s ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) left the [IBD Leaderboard list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Friday to lock in gains after a 31% rally. And Leaderboard peer **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), a Mediterranean chain, eased on Friday after setting a new high on Thursday, with shares far extended from a buy point.


In addition, **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) are all listed on the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Despite inflation, [middle-income and upper-tier consumers are driving growth at chains like Cava](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-stock-restaurants-cava-sweetgreen-mcdonalds-starbucks-inflation/), **Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)) and **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), seen as offering healthier menu options. But it's another story at other restaurants.


Domino's Stock Finds Support Near Buy Point
-------------------------------------------


Shares of the pizza delivery giant fell 0.6% to 521.83 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/). Domino's stock tested the 21-day exponential moving average Friday, but closed above that level, as well as at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), while building its current base.



The Domino's stock chart shows a seven-week flat base with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) of 542.75, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) pattern recognition. The latest entry also marks a two-year-plus high, set on April 30 after earnings. After a pullback to the 50-day line, shares have rallied in three of the past four weeks, forming the right side of the flat base.


A pullback from the June 12 interim high established a brief downtrend. Investors could treat a [break above the downward-slopingÂ trendline as a possible early entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/), around 538.44.


On Friday, the retail stock ended the session just 4% below the 542.75 official buy point.


Key Rating Is No. 1 Among 54 Restaurant Retail Stocks
-----------------------------------------------------


Among other favorable signs, DPZ stock shows an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Accumulation%2fDistribution+(Acc%2fDis)+Rating&termid=1) of A+, which indicates heavy institutional buying. It is the highest A/D Rating among 54 stocks in its industry group.


However, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) remains well below the consolidation peak. It would be a healthy sign if the RS line catches up with the stock as it tries to break out. That strength indicator has rallied in the past year, a sign of Domino's stock outperformance vs. the S&P 500.


Further, Domino's stock earns a 93 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. That is up from 91 four weeks ago. The RS Rating means that Domino's Pizza stock has outperformed 93% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.


Year to date, DPZ stock has jumped 27%. It surged 62% over the past 12 months.


Domino's Pizza Earnings Acceleration
------------------------------------


Domino's Pizza stock shows a strong 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating combines various technical and fundamental metrics into one easy-to-read score.


Domino's stock bears an 87 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) on the back of an earnings rebound in 2023 and strong earnings acceleration in the first quarter.


On April 29, Domino's Pizza reported that first-quarter earnings grew 22% as sales rose 6%, an overall beat. The company touted higher order and delivery volumes, mostly driven by lower-income consumers. Guidance also came in strong.


Both earnings and sales accelerated sharply from gains of 1% each in the fourth quarter. Domino's managed to buck a downbeat trend for eating out nationwide, with promotions and deals key to driving orders for pizzas and chicken wings among inflation-weary consumers.


On a per-share basis, Domino's Pizza earnings rebounded 17% in 2023 from an 8% decline in 2022, FactSet shows.


Analysts expect Domino's earnings to grow a further 9% in 2024, quickening to a 14% gain in 2025. Sales are seen rising a respective 8% and 7% this year and next year, well above the three-year average of 2.8%.


The 87 EPS Rating for Domino's stock is the eighth highest in its group. Chipotle stock holds the No. 1 EPS Rating and No. 1 Composite Rating among the 54 restaurant retail stocks.

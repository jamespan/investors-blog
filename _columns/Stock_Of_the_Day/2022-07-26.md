Retail stocks are still reeling after Walmart slashed its profit outlook and announced it's cutting prices to free up inventory. **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) is holding up better than its industry peers and is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). BJ stock is finding support and trading just below a potential buy point. But the current market woes and a late-stage base mean investors should be cautious.




**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) cut its full-year guidance by 11% to 13% on Monday, which sent shock waves through the retail sector. The big-box chain says customers are feeling the effects of inflation and shifting their spending to cover higher food costs. [Walmart](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-stock-good-buy/) expects lower general merchandise sales for the year and is cutting prices to clear up shelf space.


WMT stock fell nearly 8%. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) traded down nearly 4% and **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) dropped more than 6%.


Wholesalers, on the other hand, haven't fallen as hard. BJ stock faded less than 2%. **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) slumped 3.4%.

BJ's started the year off strong and hit 6.5 million members. The membership-only warehouse retailer reported 20% earnings growth to 87 cents per share for the first quarter. Revenue jumped 16.3% to $4.39 billion.


The company has worked on expanding its e-commerce offerings to compete in the push to online sales. Those investments are starting to pay off. BJ's digital sales jumped 26% in the first quarter.


BJ's also sells food and gasoline, which aren't expected to see declines even as consumers cut back on spending in other areas.


"Our business model remains more relevant than ever in the current inflationary environment," said CEO Bob Eddy. "We also continued to build on the transformational gains we have driven over the last two years."


BJ's has beaten quarterly earnings expectations since Q2 2018 and has averaged a surprise of 20.8% over the past two years. The company has posted sales growth for five straight quarters, which Wall Street expects to continue when BJ's reports results in August. For the upcoming quarter, analysts predict earnings of 77 cents per share on $4.58 billion in revenue.

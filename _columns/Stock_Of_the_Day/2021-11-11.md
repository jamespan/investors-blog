The Invesco Solar ETF, which holds top solar stocks such as **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as a strong rebound from a key support level offers a new entry.




**Invesco Solar** ([TAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAN)) contains more than 50 global solar stocks. That reduces individual stock risk for those investing in the volatile solar energy industry. Still, the exchange traded fund tends to make strong up and down moves of its own.


The TAN ETF is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). It was also added again to [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/trade/TAN) on Nov. 11. Enphase Energy stock is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks.


Enphase and SolarEdge are the top two holdings, comprising almost a quarter of the fund. Top holdings also include **Sunrun** ([RUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUN)), **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) and **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)).

President Joe Biden's newly passed $1 trillion infrastructure bill should hasten the transition to a lower-carbon energy sector. And the Build Back Better Act proposes new and extended tax credits to promote wind and solar power, electric vehicles and other clean energy programs.


"The framework, if approved, would represent the largest single investment in the clean energy economy in the U.S.," Biden has said.

**AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) is Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) as the auto parts retailer looks like a safe place to park cash in a recovering economy reshaped by Covid. AutoZone stock rose further into a buy zone, leading a move higher with rivals **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)).




Covid has been a boon for auto parts dealers, shifting demand from public to personal transportation. Meanwhile, the chip shortage has roiled new auto production, fueling a boom in used-car sales and prices. The recent jump in the 10-year Treasury yield, a key for auto loans, will contribute to affordability challenges. Bottom line: People need to get more mileage out of their vehicles â€” and that's great news for AutoZone's do-it-yourself auto parts business.


Shopping Habits 'Changed Forever'
---------------------------------


Previous periods of industry outperformance, in 1993-94, 2001-02 and 2009-11, all "were coming out of very difficult economic environments," AutoZone CEO William Rhodes said on the Sept. 21 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call. "This pandemic seems to be behaving a lot like that, just in an exponential fashion."


And Rhodes isn't expecting much giveback. "Customers have started relying on us on a more frequent basis, and I believe many of those shopping habits will have changed forever."


AutoZone's U.S. same-store sales rose 4.3% in Q4, despite the lofty comparison set by the year-ago quarter's historic 21.8% growth. While DIY same-store sales were roughly flat, commercial, or do-it-for-me, same-store sales rose 21%.


Another thing that makes auto parts retailers defensive is their ability to pass along inflation increases. AutoZone noted on the Q4 call that its costs are on the rise, especially labor costs.


AutoZone Stock Analysis
-----------------------


AutoZone stock rose 2.9% to 1,737. On Sept. 22, AZO stock cleared a 1,666.73 buy point from a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/), according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool). That flat base is part of a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) formation, a bullish pattern in a choppy market. The buy zone runs through 1,750.


AutoZone stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), the blue line in the chart provided that tracks its performance vs. the S&P 500, is at a multiyear high.



O'Reilly Automotive stock, which had slipped below a 621.83 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in recent days, rose back into range on Wednesday. ORLY stock climbed 2.1% to 626.


Advance Auto Parts rose 0.9% to 216.77, climbing within a hair of a 217.79 buy point.


AutoZone's Growth Lane
----------------------


Beyond the Covid-related tailwinds, AutoZone is seeing benefits from its mega hub strategy, CFO Jamere Jackson said on the Q4 call.


Mega hub locations carry about 100,000 different products, driving "tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as the fulfillment source for other stores," Jackson said.


Mega hub locations will grow by about 20 from the current 58 over the next 12 months.


Commercial sales rose to $3.3 billion for the year, but there's a lot of opportunity left in the $75 billion fragmented market.


International is another area of growth, with Mexico and Brazil both key markets.

Amazon Stock: Tidal Wave Of New Demand
--------------------------------------


The resulting tidal wave of new demand for household and home office supplies has created bottlenecks and shortages. In order to fulfill spiking demand, Amazon said it completed previous plans to hire [100,000 additional workers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-plans-to-hire-100000-raise-wages-to-address-coronavirus-impact/) and will add [another 75,000 workers](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/amazons-actions-to-help-employees-communities-and-customers-affected-by-covid-19?utm_source=gcaweb&utm_medium=prweb&utm_content=COVID-19_roundup) on top of that, "to help meet customer demand and assist existing employees fulfilling orders for essential products."


The company also increased the investment it's making to boost the salary of employees. It plans to set aside more than $500 million, up from $350 million.


Amazon has been expanding the size of its e-commerce services for years, to include timely expansion into grocery deliveries and other items. In addition, it continues to build warehouses and other operations in order to bring one-day delivery to its customers with its well established Amazon Prime rewards program.


Market Leader In Cloud Computing
--------------------------------


Moreover, it's the market leader in cloud computing services, which has become increasingly vital to the support and expansion of business operations, at a time when anything nonessential is being abandoned.


The company also has a big play in music and video streaming services, which are looking increasingly attractive as hundreds of millions of people stay indoors. Amazon also is exploring the health care market, having acquired online pharmacy company PillPack last year for just under $1 billion.


Not all of its ventures succeed. But many agree it's willing to take bold steps that sometimes turn into big winners.


The impact of the coronavirus will continue to take a toll on the global economy until it is contained. But not all markets are equally impacted.


"E-commerce is likely one of the biggest beneficiaries," Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Investor's Business Daily. "E-commerce is likely to see a permanent shift away from offline stores."


Amazon Stock Performance
------------------------


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Amazon stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks. The Composite Rating is designed to help investors gauge the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


In addition, the stock has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94. The rating tracks how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures against that of other stocks.


According to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), after a long basing process, the latest Amazon stock pattern is still first stage. The relative strength line dipped for a few weeks but is still rising since early February. Some of the weekly moves are mild, and that was bullish action in a frenzied bear market. It was added as a half position on Leaderboard Tuesday morning.


Amazon stock currently holds the No. 1 ranking in IBD's Retail-Internet group. It's followed by China e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)). After that is **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), another China e-commerce leader.


Best Stocks To Buy And Watch
----------------------------


When looking for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), focus on those with rising relative price strength.


Even with revenue of $280 billion in 2019 — ahead of Wall Street forecasts, by the way — Amazon has maintained its double-digit revenue growth for years. To that point, revenue in 2019 climbed 20% from the previous year.


For its fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings were $6.47 a share, beating estimates of $4.05. Revenue jumped 21% to $87.4 billion, vs. estimates of $86 billion.

The devastation of [Hurricane Ian](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-ians-death-toll-rises-as-recovery-efforts-begin-11664715665) has intensified focus on the insurance industry.Â  In its wake, the Insurance-Property/Casualty group now ranks a solid No. 34 among the [197 industries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) IBD tracks. And specialty insurer **Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)) leads all peers with a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), making it one of the top stocks to watch as it closes in on a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).




Stocks often move in groups so its natural that industry peers **W.R. Berkley** ([WRB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRB)) and **Arch Capital** ([ACGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACGL)) also have strong ratings in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-kinsale-capital-group-knsl.aspx) as they take aim at new [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


Seven quarters of earnings growth, ranging from 46% to 279%, have helped to propel interest in KNSL stock. The [insurer](https://www.investors.com/news/top-insurance-companies-customer-trust-2022/) sports a "B" [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


Plus, 29 funds with an "A+" IBD rating own shares.


Kinsale Capital also earns an "A" [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Over the last three years, the company has delivered average annual revenue gains of 42%. It posted 17% growth last quarter, ahead of the long-term pace.

Kinsale Capital Leads Stocks To Watch In Profitable Segment
-----------------------------------------------------------


Based in Richmond, Va., [Kinsale Capital](https://ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx) focuses exclusively on the small-account excess and surplus (E&S) lines market, which provides insurance for hard-to-place risks that typical insurers won't cover.


Kinsale handles 100% of underwriting authority for all its policies and is the only publicly-traded, pure-play E&S investment opportunity.


In 2021, Kinsale's largest insurance segments were Small Business and Excess Casualty, which accounted for 14.7% and 14.3% of its income, respectively. Construction (13.6%) and Commercial Property (10.3%) also comprised significant profit drivers for its insurance business.


According to an [August report](https://s29.q4cdn.com/479990906/files/doc_presentation/2022/08/August-2022-Kinsale-IR-Presentation.pdf), Kinsale Capital is poised to benefit from the growing and progressively-dislocated E&S lines market.


Top-Rated Insurer Aims To Underwrite New Breakout
-------------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already hitting a new high, Kinsale Capital is among the top stocks to watch, showing a 285.36 buy point in a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). At the end of last month, the stock recaptured its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) in strong [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/).


On Sept. 30, Kinsale sold off in heavy volume as the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) hit new lows. But KNSL stock shook off that selling pressure, found support at its 50-day line and has resumed its climb.


Kinsale Capital slipped lower to end the week, but downside volume was light. The stock closed Friday's session 8% off its buy point and well above its 50-day line.


Fellow insurance companies W.R. Berkley and Arch Capital are also within striking distance of new [buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). Arch Capital, however, dropped below its 50-day and 200-day lines Friday in heavy volume.

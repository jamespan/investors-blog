After already rising over 109% from its lows in March, **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) is pawing at a new buy zone to ring in the new year.




Idexx holds the No. 1 ranking among medical equipment stocks, outpacing **Hologic** ([HOLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLX)), **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **Cantel Medical** ([CMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMD)) and **Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)) with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/).


With an exceptionally strong [Earnings Stability Rating](https://www.investors.com/research/best-long-term-stocks/), Idexx has earned a spot alongside Masimo on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). IDXX stock has also gained entry into the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). Earlier this month, Idexx stock was highlighted among the [leading large-cap stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/hot-growth-stocks-today-will-this-pets-play-keep-rallying-in-2021/).


Given its enduring fundamental and technical strength, it's not surprising that Idexx made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-stocks-to-watch-amzn-amd-tsm-etsy/). Plus, 171 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in IDXX stock, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX).


Idexx Accelerates Growth With 'Pet' Project
-------------------------------------------


As a leader in pet health care innovation, Idexx serves practicing veterinarians around the world with a broad range of diagnostics and technology-based products and services. Headquartered in Maine, Idexx has more than 9,000 employees, offering products in over 175 countries.


In August, Idexx announced the launch of its [ProCyte One Hematology Analyzer](https://www.idexx.com/en/about-idexx/news/idexx-launches-groundbreaking-procyte-one-hematology-analyzer/).


The analyzer's advanced technology delivers workflow simplicity, enabling results in under five minutes. It also has a small footprint, freeing up valuable clinical workspace. ProCyte One's sustainable design also features recyclable containers to reduce waste.


In Q3, Idexx had investors wagging their tails with acceleration in both earnings and sales. Revenue grew from 3% in Q2 to a 19% increase in the third quarter. Earnings growth accelerated for a second straight quarter, to 36%.


Analysts expect Idexx to post 21% EPS growth this year, followed by a 12% increase in 2021. Analysts have revised estimates higher for both years.


IDXX Stock Claws Into New-High Ground
-------------------------------------


Since going in to see the Wall Street vet in March, Idexx has come back with a vengeance. While rising over 109% from its lows, the stock has stayed nicely above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), aside from a brief drop below that benchmark in September.


Idexx is now trading within a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) after clearing a 485.10 buy point from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is within striking distance of a 52-week high.


The stock closed out the year with a third-straight up week, 3% above its initial buy point.


See if Idexx can ride the [Santa Claus rally](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/the-santa-claus-rally-just-started-12-stocks-gain-most/) to even greater heights in 2021.

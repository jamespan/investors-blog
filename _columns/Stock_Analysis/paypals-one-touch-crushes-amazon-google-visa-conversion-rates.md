As **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and others battle for market share in processing online and mobile payments, they all focus on a key goal: reducing the number of people who drop off during the process without completing the purchase.


A new study from comScore shows [PayPal has the edge over its rivals](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-leads-online-conversion-comscore-study/) on that front. Shoppers using PayPal finished their purchases 87.5% of the time, compared to 51.1% for people paying with second-place **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) Checkout. Other competitors such as Amazon and **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) were lumped into a single group with a 45.6% conversion rate.


A key factor in PayPal’s performance is its One Touch product, which debuted last year and enables payment authentication without requiring the shopper to enter a user name or password each time. Twenty-one million people currently use One Touch.


Overall, PayPal has nearly 180 million active customer accounts, it and processed 4.9 billion payments in 2015, with more than 25% made on mobile platforms.


Powering Payments For Starbucks, Facebook
-----------------------------------------


PayPal has also been expanding its mobile offerings and its presence among millennials with Venmo, a digital payment app it picked up through its $800 million purchase of Braintree in 2013.


The Braintree acquisition, as well as PayPal’s buyout of Paydiant in 2015, have also led to [partnerships with Facebook and Starbucks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-at-the-heart-of-facebook-starbucks-mobile-payment-offerings/) to help power their mobile payment platforms.


PayPal Credit, which helps finance purchases made through the PayPal network, is another catalyst for growth. Last week, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said it will begin offering PayPal Credit overseas for the first time, starting with the U.K.


PayPal’s revenue growth has ranged from 14% to 17% over the last four quarters, while earnings growth has come in between 7% and 29% during the same period. The company also sports a solid 21.5% annual pretax profit margin. Look for Q1 numbers on April 27.


Re-Entering Buy Zone Ahead Of Q1 Earnings
-----------------------------------------

After clearing a 40.03 entry in March, the stock quickly reversed but found support at the 10-week line.


On Wednesday, PayPal again poked its head into a 40.03 to 42.03 buy zone on volume that was below average but rising. See if it can continue to rebound in heavier trading.


Keep in mind that buying a stock just ahead of an earnings report involves more risk since it doesn't leave much time to build a profit cushion to weather a negative reaction if the company's numbers disappoint investors.

Heart pump maker **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) is closing in on a buy point as it gets ready to report Q2 earnings Aug. 4.

  

With a mission of "recovering hearts and saving lives," Abiomed developed the Impella 2.5, which it bills as the world's smallest heart pump. On June 29, the Justice Department said it [ended an investigation](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/071715-762253-abiomed-boasts-strong-profit-growth.htm) into the company's marketing practices for Impella 2.5 without taking any enforcement action.

  

IBD's Medical-Products industry group currently ranks No. 16, and also includes fellow medical device makers **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) and **St. Jude Medical** ([STJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STJ)), which on Wednesday announced it was acquiring heart failure treatment firm **Thoratec** ([THOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THOR)).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Abiomed has posted three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth.

  

Revenue gains have also been strong, coming in at 34% in each of the last two reports.

  

For the full year, analysts EPS growth to come in at -5%, but that number was recently revised higher, as was the estimate for a 45% rise in 2017.

  

While a 99 rating is typically a good thing, that's not the case for the Earnings Stability rating. A lower score indicates more stable growth, so Abiomed's 99 rating means it has a history of volatile earnings.

  

However, its 99 Composite Rating tells you that, in terms of overall fundamental and technical strength, Abiomed is in the top 1% of all stocks.

  

The number of funds that owns shares has been rising in recent quarters. And Abiomed made IBD's latest list of [New Buys By Top-Performing Stock Funds](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/070715-760552-top-performing-mutual-funds-latest-buys-and-sells.htm). Eight leading funds picked up a total of $2.3 million worth of shares.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Last October, the stock bolted higher when it reported triple-digit earnings growth for Q3.

  

After continuing to climb with good support along the 10-week line, Abiomed spiked again in January when it posted yet another quarter of triple-digit EPS growth.

  

The stock is now working on a second-stage cup, with a 77 buy point.

  

In recent days, Abiomed has closed near the top of the price range on good volume â€” a sign of institutional buying.

  

Also, the Relative Strength line has entered new high ground ahead of a possible breakout.

Cross Country Healthcare Earns Seal Of Approval
-----------------------------------------------


Founded in 1986, Cross Country Healthcare (CCH) provides professionals for health care providers, including contingent staffing, permanent placement and consulting services.


Including 2022, the company has won the [Best of Staffing Award](https://www.crosscountryhealthcare.com/blogs/cch-wins-2022-best-of-staffing-award-for-service-excellence#:~:text=Best%20of%20Staffing%C2%AE%20is,awards%20in%20the%20staffing%20industry.) from ClearlyRated in multiple years. CCH was the first public company to earn [The Joint Commission Gold Seal of Approval for Health Care Staffing Services Certification with Distinction](https://www.jointcommission.org/accreditation-and-certification/certification/certifications-by-setting/health-care-staffing-certification/).


Over the last three quarters, CCH has delivered average earnings growth of 413%. Over the last three years, Cross Country Healthcare has generated average annual EPS growth of 366%.


Sales growth has also been impressive, ranging from 53% to 197% over the last five quarters.


CCH is on tap to announce Q2 numbers on Aug. 3 after the close.


In May, [CCH announced a partnership with the National Black Nurses Association](https://ir.crosscountryhealthcare.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cross-country-partners-national-black-nurses-association). The alliance establishes the Cross Country Healthcare Nursing Scholarship Fund to provide two annual scholarships. Each year, the scholarships will be given each year to qualifying members of NBNA who are pursuing a Bachelor of Science in nursing or higher degree.


CCRN Stock Weathering Volatile Market — So Far
----------------------------------------------


Cross Country Healthcare and AMN have both formed [double bottoms](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), a common [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/) in volatile markets.


CCRN stock has retaken a 24.06 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). After soaring beyond its [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), which extends to extends to 26.31, the stock closed the week at the very top of that range.


It has now posted nine straight up weeks, retaking its [10-week and 40-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) along the way.


It's common to see the 10-week line undercut the long-term 40-week line during a [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/), and Cross Country Healthcare did just that. But a soaring RS line and multiple up weeks in big volume, show the stock has built up a good amount of immunity in this difficult market.


Note that Cross Country Healthcare is thinly traded, averaging under 465,000 shares a day. The daily average dollar volume is just over $11 million.


After briefly clearing then slipping back below a 111.49 buy point, AMN Healthcare has retaken that entry, jumping nearly 7% Thursday. Volume was rising and 74% above average. AMN stock showed resilience Friday, coming off its lows for the day to end in positive territory.

Big Data, Big Business
----------------------


We hear a lot about [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/)Â and machine learning, and how cloud-based applications are driving smart cars, smart homes and other always-connected smart devices. But the indispensable ingredient behind the AI revolution is Big Data.


Whether it's an algorithm making product or content recommendations or a business executive trying to make strategic decisions based on consumer behavior, the output is only as good as the data that are input in the first place. And the information is only as useful as it is understandable.


Big Data firms like Tableau Software, Splunk and IBD 50 stock **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) help businesses capture, mine and make sense of the massive amounts of data flowing through their networks.


While data analytics software can be intimidating and confusing, Tableau focuses on making data accessible and understandable to ordinary people.


The Seattle-based company has over 50,000 customer accounts across a wide range of industries, including aerospace and defense, insurance, banking, automotive, and education.


Big Data led to big profits for Tableau in Q2, with the company reporting a 310% spike in earnings. But analysts see that reversing sharply lower to a 237% decline in the third quarter.


Yet the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-unitedhealth-texas-instruments-united-airlines-expeditors/) have shown interest in Tableau. Sixty-six funds with an A+ rating have a position in the stock, and the number of funds that own shares jumped from 381 to 427 in Q2.


Big Data, Big Breakout?
-----------------------


Since a breakout in May 2017, Tableau Software has risen around 95%. The stock is now trying to mine a new breakout from a later-stage flat base showing a 112.52 buy point, which it cleared earlier.


On Friday, Tableau managed to climb back into the 112.52 to 118.15 buy zone, closing the week at 113.92. The relative strength line is just below a new 52-week high.



Splunk gapped up to clear a 121.74 buy point on Aug. 24. After climbing more than 5% above that price over the next several days, it retreated more than 5% in above-average volume Wednesday. But on Thursday, Splunk bounced back into the buy zone and added another 1.6% on Friday.


Adobe also retreated from a buy point it broke past earlier. On Thursday, it found support at its 50-day line and edged higher again Friday, leaving it just 1% below the 263.93 entry.

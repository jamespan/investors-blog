When looking for the [best stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) and track, start your search with the top-rated companies in highly ranked industry groups. Leading medical software stock **Athenahealth** ([ATHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHN)) currently fits that bill.




With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), Athenahealth shares the No. 1 ranking among medical software stocks with **Medidata Solutions** ([MDSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDSO)) and [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)). The industry group ranks No. 4 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.


Athenahealth made IBD's latest list of [stocks expecting 50%-plus EPS growth](https://www.investors.com/research/q2-earnings-preview/) in Q2. Analysts see the Massachusetts-based company posting a 78% rise in earnings when it reports on July 30. Veeva just missed making the list, with analysts looking for 47% growth when it reports fiscal 2019 Q2 numbers around late August. Consensus estimates call for a 25% rise in earnings for Medidata Solutions when it reports July 24.

Medical Software Stock With Accelerating Growth
-----------------------------------------------


With over 5,200 employees, Athenahealth develops software to manage electronic health records, medical billing and patient engagement. The company, which was founded in 1997 and went public in 2007, works with more than 114,000 medical providers.


Athenahealth has posted two straight quarters of accelerating top- and bottom-line growth. Earnings have spiked from a 7% decline in Q3 to a 291% increase in Q1. Revenue growth has risen from 10% to 15% over the same period.


The stock's B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-helps/) and 1.0 up/down volume ratio point to institutional demand for shares.


Healthy Breakout Ahead?
-----------------------


Athenahealth is working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) as part of a longer base-on-base formation. The buy point is 164.04. Within the pattern, the stock has shown several weeks of tight closes and has found support at its 10-week moving average.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remains well below new-high ground. Look for that benchmark line to move sharply higher as Athenahealth completes the base.


In the final hour of trading, Athenahealth recouped enough of the day's earlier losses to close in the upper half of the price range and above the 50-day line. The stock ended the week at 156.76, 4% below the entry.



Veeva Systems is currently out of buy range from a breakout in a double bottom back in May. Veeva closed Friday's session at 83.10, leaving it 10% above its recent 75.67 buy point.


On Tuesday, Medidata Solutions cleared an 85.79 buy point in a later-stage cup with handle. The stock ended the week at 87, still within the buy zone, which extends to 90.08.

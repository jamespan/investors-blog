As the Internet of Things revolution shifts into higher gear, cars are becoming smarter and safer. And **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) is at the forefront of that change.

  

The Israel-based company, which had its IPO in 2014, is a [leading developer of camera-based driver assistance systems](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/050415-750872-mobileye-makes-advanced-driver-assistance-systems-for-tesla-automakers.htm) (ADAS), and its vision technology is already used by 22 of the world's top 25 automakers, including **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Nissan** ([NSANY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSANY)), Audi and BMW.

  

CEO Ziv Aviram says a U.S. carmaker — rumored to be **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) — will soon launch a semiautonomous, nearly hands-free-driving car for highway use, using Mobileye's camera technology.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After slowing in recent quarters, sales growth edged higher in Q1 to 28%.

  

Although year-over-year earnings growth was negative in Q4, it topped estimates. And Mobileye followed that with a 33% jump in earnings-per-share in Q1.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 77%, then increase 82% in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

While Mobileye has a modest 85 Composite Rating, fund managers and other large investors have shown interest in the stock. The B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to moderate institutional buying over the past 13 weeks, and the number of funds with a position in Mobileye spiked last quarter from 253 to 372.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public in August 2014, Mobileye broke out of a short [IPO base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/703938-yy-kept-low-profile-but-racked-up-big-gains.htm) and rose over 40% in just three weeks.

  

Then it fell into a steep slump, living under its 10-week moving average line for 17 weeks.

  

After beating Q4 earnings estimates in February, the stock bounced back on heavy volume and began building the right side of its current cup with handle. Because of the deep 46% decline, it's a somewhat flawed base.

  

The buy point is 48.88, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

As of early Thursday morning, Mobileye was trading just above that price and still within the 48.88 to 51.32 buy zone.

**Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) makes and distributes wood products and building materials for residential and commercial construction in the U.S. and Canada. Although the company went public in February 2013, it was created by the 1957 merger of the Boise-Payette Lumber Co. of Boise, Idaho, and the Cascade Lumber Co. of Yakima, Wash.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

While earnings growth has been somewhat sporadic, Boise Cascade has posted two consecutive quarters of triple-digit gains. Sales growth came in at 13% and 12% during the same period.

  

For 2014, analysts expect earnings to rise 78%, followed by a 25% gain in 2015.

  

The company sports a 92 Composite Rating, and its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate institutional buying over the past three months.

  

The stock's 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership in recent quarters also point to demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Boise Cascade rose 21% from a short IPO base in 2013, but that marked a high point it wasn't able to recapture until October.

  

On Oct. 21, it broke out of a flat base just ahead of Q3 earnings and moved back into new high ground after posting another quarter of triple-digit EPS growth. That move was supported by three weeks of heavy trading, a sign of institutional accumulation.

  

The stock rose 19% before starting to form its current consolidation.

  

Boise Cascade dipped below the 10-week line in the bottom of that pattern, but quickly bounced back and started building the right side of its base.

  

The stock poked above its 38.09 buy point Friday, although volume was light.

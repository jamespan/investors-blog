Real estate investment trusts, or [REITs, had a big year in 2014](http://news.investors.com/investing-ipo-analysis/012615-736298-how-are-reits-doing.htm), rising 22%, compared with an 11% gain for the S&P 500 and a 13% rise for the Nasdaq. And that's without including dividends, which are generally higher for REITs than other stocks.


**Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) is one of the leaders within IBD's Finance â€” Property REIT industry group and is currently working on a first-stage [flat base](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656343-getting-started-chart-patterns-flat-base.aspx). Investment management firm **Oaktree Capital** ([OAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAK)) formed the Arizona-based company, which went public last November.


Store Capital's name is an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate. As of the end of last year, it had investments in 947 single-tenant commercial properties, including locations used by restaurants, movie theaters and other service, retail and industrial sectors.


**Key Fundamentals**


Store Capital has shown strong top- and bottom-line growth for at least the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has accelerated over the last two reports, with consecutive quarters of triple-digit gains.


For the full year, analysts expect EPS to grow 55%, followed by a 17% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Store Capital's 4% return on equity is well below the 17% or higher return on investment that you look for, but overall it scores a respectable 93 Composite Rating.


**Chart Analysis**


After its November 2014 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) at 18.50 per share, the stock climbed nicely until peaking at 23.67 in late January. Since then, it's been working on a first-stage flat base.


While the stock fell below the 10-week line as it was forming that pattern, it quickly reclaimed its benchmark two weeks later on weekly volume 109% above average.


The buy point is 23.77, 10 cents above the peak on the left. Store Capital poked its head above that price last Friday but closed below it.


As the [Nasdaq and S&P 500 came under pressure](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/032515-745123-stocks-tumble-in-higher-trade-biotechs-chips-hit-hard.htm) this week, Store Capital also pulled back; the stock closed down three days in a row. If it continues lower, see if it finds support at the 50-day moving average line, and keep an eye on the volume.


While trading was above average on Monday and Tuesday, it was much lower than on Friday's big up day and has been lightening up. That could mean large investors are not selling aggressively and may move back into buying mode once the overall market outlook improves.


So while last week's breakout attempt failed, since it's a newer IPO with strong fundamentals and signs of institutional support, Store Capital may be one to watch as investors wait for the general market to bounce back.

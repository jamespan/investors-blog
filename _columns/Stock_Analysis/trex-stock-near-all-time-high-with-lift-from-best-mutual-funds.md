Not every breakout is a home run, but the best money managers on the field have lifted wood-alternative building products leader **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) into the upper deck of a new buy zone.




While investors focus on tech titans like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Trex joins these industry giants on IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-tech-stocks-amazon-apple-microsoft-nvidia/).


Like Amazon, Apple and Facebook, Trex stock is trading right around an all-time high.


The world's largest manufacturer of high-performance wood-alternative decking and railing was already in buy zone when it released Q2 earnings on Aug. 3. Trex initially retreated right after reporting, but the Virginia-based company is now trading at the upper end of its buy zone, which extends to 139.59.


Top Funds Take Stake In Trex
----------------------------


When looking for the best stocks to buy, follow the smart money. That is, see where the best-performing fund managers are placing their bets.


In addition to household names like Amazon, Apple and Facebook, these savvy investors scour the stock market for companies showing strength in key metrics, such as profit margins, return on equity and long-term earnings growth. Trex does well in each of these categories.


Over the last three years, Trex has grown annual earnings at an average pace of 24%, including average EPS growth of 34% over the last three quarters. Trex also had a 25.7% annual pretax profit margin and a 37% ROE last year.


Leading money managers have taken note. T. Rowe Price (PRNHX) owns shares, as do 161 other funds with an A+ rating from IBD.


Trex earns a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning it's outpacing 95% of all stocks in terms of the most important [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Trex Stock Tests Top Of Buy Zone, All-Time High
-----------------------------------------------


Trex managed to close Friday's session in positive territory and just within the 132.94 to 139.59 buy range.


The stock has been moving steadily higher since finding support at its 50-day line in June. The relative strength line is just shy of a 52-week high.


With its latest earnings report behind it, look for Trex to move into new-high ground in strong volume.

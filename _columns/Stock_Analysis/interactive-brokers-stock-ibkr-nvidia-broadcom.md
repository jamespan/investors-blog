This week, **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) landed a spot on the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/nvidia-stock-ibd-breakout-stocks-index-gev-birk-kvyo-ibkr/) alongside **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). Now, as Nvidia fails to hold support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), Interactive Brokers looks to shore up a new buy point.


In a sign of market leadership, the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) stock earns a coveted [blue dot in MarketSurge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) with its relative strength line notching a 52-week high. As Interactive Brokers tries to withstand selling pressure on the Nasdaq, here are four signs that large investors want a piece of the action.




Interactive Brokers Expands AI Arsenal
--------------------------------------


Interactive Brokers provides automated trade execution and custody of securities, commodities and foreign exchange. On a single integrated platform, the firm works across more than 150 markets in 28 currencies for clients from over 200 countries and territories.

Can Strong Demand Fend Off Struggling Nasdaq?
---------------------------------------------


Looking to complete a still-intact third-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) with a 193.42 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), Interactive Brokers is displaying multiple indicators of strong demand.


The stock sports a strong B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and a 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


Plus, 41 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares of Interactive Brokers. Rounding out a fourth sign of demand, the stock has seen six quarters of rising fund ownership.


Note also how the [98 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-interactive-brokers-ibkr.aspx) for Interactive Brokers ties [Nvidia's score](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.aspx) and is just below the highest-possible 99 rating for [Broadcom](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-broadcom-avgo.aspx), which is testing support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


After falling below its 50-day line, Nvidia stock has also slipped below its 21-day benchmark.

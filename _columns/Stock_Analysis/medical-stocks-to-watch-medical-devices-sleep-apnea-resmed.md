In this volatile market, it's best to avoid making any new buys. But it's wise to keep an eye on stocks to watch like **ResMed** ([RMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMD)) that are showing resilience and forming new chart patterns.


ResMed, a maker of medical devices, appeared on a recent list of [16 stocks to watch in this volatile market](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-volatile-market-relative-strength/). Fellow medical stocks **Merk** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) and **Omnicell** ([OMCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMCL)) also made the list.


One key factor to watch during a volatile market is the relative strength line. A rising RS line, particularly one at a new 52-week high, shows the stock is o[utperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/). It's a particularly bullish sign if the stock is nearing a potential buy point as we wait for a new market uptrend to begin.

Medical Stocks: Dividend-Paying Medical Devices Maker
-----------------------------------------------------


ResMed makes cloud-connected medical devices for monitoring patients with sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions.


The San Diego, Calif.-based company has more than 6,000 employees operating in more than 120 countries. ResMed generated $2.3 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2018 (ended June 30, 2018).


Earlier this month, ResMed announced it was [buying Propeller Health](http://investors.resmed.com/investor-relations/events-and-presentations/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/ResMed-to-Acquire-Propeller-Health-a-Leader-in-COPD-and-Asthma-Connected-Health-Solutions-for-225-Million/default.aspx) for $225 million. Propeller Health is a leading provider of health solutions for COPD and asthma. It was named a "2017 Most Innovative Company" by Fast Company.


ResMed has produced four quarters of solid double-digit earnings growth, ranging from 23% to 37%. Revenue gains have ranged from 12% to 15% during the same period. The company has a 25% annual pretax profit margin and 25% return on equity.


With a 96 Composite Rating and a No. 25 ranking for its medical devices industry group (out of 197), ResMed earns a spot among the t[op-rated stocks to watch in highly rated industries](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3853550).


ResMed also pays a dividend, currently yielding 1.3% on an annualized basis.


While the stock has a mediocre C Accumulation/Distribution Rating, it has seen seven straight quarters of rising fund ownership, including a jump from 1,151 to 1,212 last quarter.


Medical Stocks To Watch In Volatile Market
------------------------------------------


ResMed is working on a cup-shaped base. It's a first-stage chart pattern because the stock undercut the low in its prior consolidation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). That's a positive sign since breakouts from early-stage patterns tend to produce the best gains. Another bullish indicator is how ResMed's relative strength line is already in new-high ground.The buy point is 116.74.


While it's best to be very cautious about making any new buys in this volatile market, see if ResMed can break past either buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal to show strong conviction for the move.


On Monday, the stock rose 2.7% to 112.90. Volume was 27% above average. On Tuesday, ResMed gapped up and managed to hold a gain of nearly 1% despite the continued market volatility. It closed the day 2% below the entry, with its RS line once again hitting a new 52-week high. Volume was 31% above average.


In early trading Wednesday, the stock is up nearly 2%, bringing it to within just 1% of the entry.

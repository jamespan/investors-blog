Why did NET stock just blast off into buy range? Maybe it was the fifth straight quarter of triple-digit earning growth generated by **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), an enterprise software partner of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) .




Maybe it was spurred by earlier news that Cloudflare helped discover a new online threat that led to the [largest attack in internet history](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2023/cloudflare-helps-discover-new-online-threat-that-led-to-largest-attack-in/). Or perhaps analysts' forecasts of 243% EPS growth this year and strong institutional demand for NET stock, as evidenced by an B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and 1.5 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), ignited the move.


Whatever the cause, the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) demands Wall Street's attention as it earns a stellar [98 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cloudflare-net.aspx). The score means the firewall and cloud connectivity leader currently outpaces 98% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


That puts NET stock right up there with fellow enterprise software leaders **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), which just generated a heavy-volume gap-up of its own this week on a [bullish 2024 outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/wday-stock-workday-earnings-news-q32023/), also stands strong among its industry peers.


**Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) — also a collaborator with [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — has joined the party as it [tests a new buy zone](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/mndy-stock-blasts-into-buy-range-as-monday-com-joins-ai-race-with-microsoft-google/).


Now another industry peer —**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) — has just blasted higher, [gapping up on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-earnings-q32023/) as cost-cutting improved margins.


AI Drives Demand For Cloudflare And Its Peers
---------------------------------------------


The rapid spread of [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-news/) plays an integral role in driving enterprise software firms, including Cloudflare.


The San Francisco-based company integrates machine learning and AI networks with a range of cloud connectivity platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Datadog and more.


Serving data from 310 cities in over 120 countries around the world, Cloudflare focuses on software for firewalls, routing, load balancing, traffic optimization and other network services. Labeling itself as the world's first connectivity cloud, Cloudflare helps to manage the hyperconnectivity of today's always-connected-across-all-devices world.


In September, Cloudflare announced it had launched the [most complete platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2023/cloudflare-launches-workers-ai-deploy-ai-inference/) to deploy fast, secure and compliant AI inference at scale.

NET Stock Leaps Into Buy Zone
-----------------------------


Booming earnings growth and the continuing AI boom have helped fuel a breakout for NET stock. For several days before and after the company's latest [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/net-stock-cloudflare-earnings-q32023/), volume came in well above average.


Cloudflare broke out Wednesday, rising nearly 6% in above-average trade. NET stock remains in buy range from a 76.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). As the Nasdaq rebounded Friday, Cloudflare rose over 2% to close the session 4% above the entry.


Workday and CRM stock continue to build on their powerful breakouts.

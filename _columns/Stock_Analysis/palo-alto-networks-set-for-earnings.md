With the market in a correction, step back and ask: Which industries could help lead the next uptrend? And which stocks are the key players in those fields?

  

Cybersecurity is one major trend to watch, as the Internet of Things and mobile connectivity make financial and other sensitive data increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks.

  

**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), along with **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), has emerged as a leader in that fast-growing space.

  

Research firm Cybersecurity Ventures says that the worldwide cybersecurity market is estimated to rise from $77 billion in 2015 to $170 billion by 2020.

  

Palo Alto has been working to identify a malware called "KeyRaider," which has affected an estimated 225,000 **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iTunes users.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Palo Alto's sales growth has ranged from 46% to 59% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has been even more impressive, coming in at 109% in the latest report.

  

On Wednesday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results for fiscal year 2015, which ended July 31.

  

Recent selling in the stock has pushed Palo Alto's Accumulation/Distribution Rating to a D-, but it does have a history of rising fund ownership in recent quarters, and several top funds have reported a position in the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After its July 2012 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm), Palo Alto Networks fell into a long slump. But the stock eventually found its footing and rose as much as 133% from a breakout in August 2014 into July 2015.

  

As the indexes sold off in recent weeks, Palo Alto fell below its 10-week line but found support at the 40-week moving average. See if it forms a new base and watch how the market reacts to its upcoming earnings report.

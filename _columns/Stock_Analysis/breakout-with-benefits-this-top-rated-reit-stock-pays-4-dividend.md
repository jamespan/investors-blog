Real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks have fared well in recent months, and **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) is looking to extend its climb with a new breakout.


The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company's three-year annual EPS growth rate of 110% and its 89% three-year sales growth rate aren't the only things attracting investors.


Store Capital also pays a dividend currently yielding 4.1%, topping fellow [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) members **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)) (3.0%) and **Public Space Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) (2.5%), as well as other top-rated property REITs **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)) (2.5%) and **CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)) (2.5%). Only **Agree Realty** ([ADC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADC)) currently has a higher yield, at 4.8%.


Top-Performing Funds Buying Shares
----------------------------------


Store Capital, which owns over 900 single-tenant commercial real estate properties in 46 states, holds the No. 3 spot within the Property REITs industry group, behind CoreSite and CubeSmart. The group currently ranks No. 40.


Store Capital made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-on-defense-with-reits-airlines-and-building-stocks/), with 12 funds investing $152 million in the stock over the prior three months. Fellow REITs Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS) and Public Storage also made the list.


Store Capital Enters Buy Zone
-----------------------------


Following its November 2014 IPO, Store Capital hit resistance just under the $24 mark. It finally cleared the ceiling in late January, and although it pulled back in February, note how that former area of resistance became a floor of support.

Volume spiked 674% above average on March 29 as the company priced a secondary offering of common stock at $25.25 per share. The stock managed to close in the upper half of the day's range and above the offer price.


The current consolidation is part of a first-stage base-on-base, with a 26.45 entry, 10 cents above the peak on the left.


On Monday, Store Capital cleared that entry and, as of early Tuesday, was still trading within the 26.45 to 27.77 buy range.


Volume on Monday was 21% above average, shy of the 40% or higher spike you would prefer to see on the day of a breakout. See if heavier volume kicks in and keep an eye out for Q1 earnings, set for May 5.

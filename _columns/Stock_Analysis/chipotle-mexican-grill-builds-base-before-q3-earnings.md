Top-rated restaurant stocks like **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) may get a boost from two new bills from Congress and a rise in consumer confidence.

  

The return of carnitas to many of the fast-casual restaurant chain's locations has given Chipotle a boost and reinforced the Denver-based company's commitment to its "Food with Integrity" philosophy.

  

This week's [7% surge in consumer confidence](http://news.investors.com/investing-ibd-industry-themes/092915-773256-restaurant-stocks-that-could-work.htm) and higher-than-expected consumer spending in August could also mean more customers for Chipotle and fellow restaurant stocks like **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) and **Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen** ([PLKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLKI)).

  

Another potentially tasty development that came last month was the House Ways and Means Committee's approval of two bills that would make permanent certain depreciation-related benefits for new restaurant construction. The National Restaurant Association applauded the pending legislation.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

On July 21, Chipotle posted mixed results for Q2, just beating on earnings with a 27% gain but just missing estimates with a 14% rise in revenue.

  

The company is expected to report Q3 numbers on Oct. 20.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 23%, followed by a 19% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised lower, so investors will see if the trend reverses.

  

Chipotle sports a solid 25% return on equity and a five-year EPS growth rate of 26%.

  

Overall, Chipotle earns a 98 Composite Rating. And despite selling pressure in the market, the stock still holds a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock's recent action offers important lessons on [how to read charts](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786&nav=IBDUCourse5) and the concept of [support and resistance](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/how-to-read-stock-charts-support-and-resistance/).

  

Last summer, Chipotle ran into resistance just under the 700 mark. It temporarily cleared that ceiling at the beginning of this year but pulled back to form a 27-week consolidation.

  

During that time, the stock's 10-week line fell below its 40-week moving average. It's a sign of technical weakness when a shorter-term moving average undercuts a longer-term one.

  

But it's a sign of renewed strength when that trend reverses. And it did for Chipotle when its 10-week line got back above the 40-week moving average in August.

  

Also note how the stock's recent tight trading right along the 10-week line is happening around a former area of resistance near 720.

  

It's healthy behavior when a stock turns a former ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support.

  

It's also bullish to see the Relative Strength line trending higher and near new high ground.

  

The question now is, can Chipotle maintain that support and use it as a building block for a new climb?

  

A string of heavy-volume up weeks before and within its current base also points to institutional accumulation in the stock.

  

So investors will see if Chipotle can move higher and punch through the 758.71 buy point on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

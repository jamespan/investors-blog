Today we're going to look at **HD Supply Holdings** ([HDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDS)), which was featured in the Jan. 10 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/010914-685814-housing-bolsters-home-depot-spinoff-hd-supply.htm).

  

They used to be a unit of **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and were sold to private equity firms in 2007. The stock came public on the Nasdaq last summer.

  

They provide a wide range of products and services — everything from countertops, plumbing fixtures and hardware to electrical transformers, storm drains and power tools.

  

The breadth of their products puts them into a number of construction and industrial markets, just not residential.

  

Still, much of their business is dependent to varying degrees on the new residential construction market.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•After some losses in the early part of last year, the firm scored triple-digit earnings growth gains the past two quarters. 

  

• But sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, dipping into the single digits, so watch to see if that improves. 

  

• For the full year, analysts predict earnings will total 54 cents a share in the 2014 fiscal year, up from a $3.40-cent-a-share loss the previous year. And they see earnings climbing 152% in fiscal 2015.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-h-d-supply-holdings-inc-hds.aspx) shows HD Supply's 79 Composite Rating is ranked No. 18 among the 36 stocks in its Building-Construction Products industry group.

  

And the group as a whole is ranked No. 16 among IBD's 197 industries, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, HD Supply came public last June at 18 a share and began to climb.

  

With an IPO it's a good strategy to wait until it settles down and forms its first base pattern before getting on board.

  

HD Supply climbed to just above 25 a share, then pulled back and carved out a cup-with-handle base.

  

To find the ideal buy point in that pattern, just add 10 cents to the peak in the handle. That makes the buy point 24.98.

  

Watch to see if the stock can breakout and climb past that buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average. If it does, it could give investors a buying opportunity.

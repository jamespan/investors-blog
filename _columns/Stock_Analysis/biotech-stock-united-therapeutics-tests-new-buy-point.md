While the market has been ailing in recent days, **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) has shown healthy action, testing a 137.03 buy point in early Thursday trading.

  

The biotech stock develops therapies to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, cancer and some of the most complicated viral diseases. United Therapeutics' Adcirca hypertension treatment is a key driver of sales.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After a sharp decline in EPS growth, earnings bounced back in Q3, coming in at 41%. But revenue continued to trend lower, slipping to 9%.

  

United Therapeutics still earns a solid SMR Rating of A due to its 29% return on equity and 39.8% pretax profit margin. The company is expected to report Q4 earnings in late February.

  

The biotech firm's three-year annual EPS growth rate of 74% is also a positive, and the biotech industry group is ranked No. 1 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

Overall, United Therapeutics earns a 98 Composite Rating, and its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate institutional buying the last three months.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock made a nice climb in 2013, culminating with a huge gap up in December of that year. That move came on news the FDA had approved the company's drug, Orenitram, to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension.

  

That was followed by a 34-week double bottom. The stock bolted out of that base on Aug. 29 on news of a favorable decision in a patent infringement lawsuit related to its drug, Remodulin.

  

After rising for a few weeks, the stock began forming its current consolidation, a third-stage flat base. While later-stage bases can be riskier, especially in a weaker market, trading has been relatively tight and the stock found support at its 10-week line.

  

Also, United Therapeutics' relative strength line had been trending up and nearing new high ground ahead of Thursday morning's attempted breakout.

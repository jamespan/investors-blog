It's no small feat for a large, well-established company to reinvent itself and once again become an innovative industry leader. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) has managed to do that by shifting to software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription model, and moving aggressively into analytics and cloud marketing.




Fellow [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) has also pulled off such a move. Microsoft and Adobe have both found new life as SaaS and cloud computing giants.


Top money managers have certainly taken notice.


Adobe made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-lead-apple-netflix-microsoft-google-coronavirus-stock-market-rebound-attempt/), with 17 qualifying funds investing an estimated $289 million in the stock over the last three months. Plus, 389 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own the stock, including Fidelity OTC (FOCPX). Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) also owns shares in Adobe stock.


Microsoft stock also made the list, with 16 leading funds investing about $1.1 billion in the Seattle-based company during the same period.


In the next list of new buys by the best mutual funds, which comes out May 8, both Adobe and Microsoft again made the cut.

Cloud's The Limit For Adobe Stock
---------------------------------


Institutional investors want to see efficiently run companies with a long track record of success. With a 39% return on equity and annual pretax profit margin, Adobe certainly fits that bill.


Microsoft stock is similarly impressive, with a 35% profit margin and 40% ROE.


Adobe and Microsoft are in the No. 10-ranked Computer Software-Desktop industry group. With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Adobe stock now ties Microsoft, which just achieved that mark on Thursday's action.


In addition to moving its creative suite of products like Photoshop, Illustrator and Premier to a cloud-based subscription model, Adobe has become a leader in analytics. The Silicon Valley-based pioneer just announced the launching of the [Adobe Digital Economy Index](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2020/Adobe-Unveils-First-Digital-Economy-Index/default.aspx).


The new index is billed as the "first real-time barometer of the digital economy, which analyzes trillions of online transactions across 100 million product (codes) in 18 product categories." Adobe helps clients manage and monetize various aspects of this data though products such as Advertising Cloud, Analytics and Audience Manager.


Adobe Stock, Microsoft Stock Test New Buy Zones
-----------------------------------------------


Like Microsoft stock, Adobe is testing a new buy point. Both stocks were down Friday as the market sold off on news of a possible new tariff war with China.


Adobe gained 1.3% Thursday to move just above 350.48 entry in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The buy zone extends up to 5% above the ideal buy point. Adobe is now testing resistance at that buy point. It's down Friday, but trying to come off its lows for the day.


Meanwhile, Microsoft closed Thursday's session up 1% at 180.40, just above a 180.10 entry.


The [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) for both stocks are showing signs of market leadership.


As the Nasdaq and S&P 500 try to show resilience in the face of [coronavirus stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) and trade tensions with China, see if the silver linings for leading cloud stocks Adobe and Microsoft can continue to shine.

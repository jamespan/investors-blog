Tech titans **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) have both ventured far beyond their core businesses in search and social media, and they continue to battle for more market share in the mobile advertising space that they already dominate.


But how do they compare in terms of key fundamentals and recent chart action?


Alphabet -- driven mostly by Google, which oversees search, as well as YouTube and Android -- is several times larger than Facebook in terms of revenue, generating $21.3 billion in Q4 compared to $5.8 billion for its rival. In fact, Alphabet’s Q4 sales topped the $17.93 billion Facebook generated for all of 2015.


Alphabet earned $4.9 billion in adjusted net income for the fourth quarter, compared to $1.5 billion for Facebook.


In its Q4 report in February, Alphabet laid out for the first time the cost of its so-called moonshot projects.


In 2015, it spent $3.6 billion on ambitious initiatives that may drive future growth, including self-driving cars; Verily, a unit formerly known as Google Lifesciences that is entering the robot-assisted surgery industry to compete with **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)); and Nest Labs, which is bringing Internet of Things (IoT) technology to home appliances.


Facebook also has no shortage of aggressive moves into new industries, including its push into virtual reality through its buyout of Oculus VR.


But what about growth rates for the two Internet icons?


Alphabet’s quarterly earnings growth accelerated from 5% to 28% over the last four reports, while Facebook’s gains ranged from 16% to 46% during the same period.


Team Zuckerberg’s annual EPS growth rate of 51% also tops Alphabet’s 13%. Both companies have strong annual pre-tax profit margins, but Facebook  has the edge in that metric, with a 55.6% profit margin compared to Alphabet’s 33.1%.


Not surprisingly, the two Internet icons rank No. 1 (Facebook) and No. 2 in the Internet-Content industry group, and both sport the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.


Alphabet, Facebook Near Buy Points ... With A Blemish
-----------------------------------------------------


Alphabet and Facebook have been showing similar chart action recently. Both stocks retreated during the week ended Feb. 5, as tech stocks **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) and Alphabet sold off after reporting earnings.

But the two titans of tech soon found support at their 10-week moving averages and have continued to edge higher.


Alphabet is carving out a new base with a 810.46 entry, 10 cents above the peak on the left.


One blemish for both stocks is the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771). Facebook currently has the lowest-possible rating of E, and Alphabet isn’t much better at D-.


See if that improves for both stocks in the coming days and weeks, and see if Alphabet can clear its new buy point on volume at least 40% higher than normal on the day of any attempted breakout.

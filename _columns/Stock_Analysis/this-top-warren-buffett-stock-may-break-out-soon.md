Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) is the largest shareholder in oil and gas refiner **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)), giving the Oracle of Omaha a promising pipeline to profits if the stock is able to pump out a new breakout.









 
 
 Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 16% of Phillips 66, accounting for about 4% of Buffett's overall portfolio — up from less than 0.5% at the end of 2014.
Last month, Phillips 66 announced a $3 billion share repurchase program, which increases the company's buyback authorization to $12 billion since the third quarter of 2012. Buying back shares is seen as a sign that management has confidence in the company's future.


The Houston-based refiner also [pays a dividend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2531707), currently yielding 3% on an annualized basis.


Rebounding Earnings Growth
--------------------------


After several quarters of year-over-year declines in earnings per share, growth has accelerated recently, jumping from a 16% rise in Q2 to a 58% spike in Q3. Analysts are looking for a 656% jump in earnings for the fourth quarter and a 60% increase for the full year.


Top-line gains have also picked up, rising from 10% to 19% last quarter.


Signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/which-stocks-have-top-fund-managers-been-buying-and-selling/) include a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.3 up/down volume ratio and one quarter of rising fund ownership.


Breakout In The Pipeline?
-------------------------


Phillips 66 is working on a shallow flat base as part of a first-stage base-on-base formation. The buy point is 95.10.



The stock has found support at its 10-week moving average within the base, but its relative strength line still needs to get closer to new high ground to show rising market leadership.


On Wednesday, Phillips 66 was down slightly, but found support at the 10-day moving average. The stock closed Friday's shortened session up 0.3% to end Thanksgiving week approximately 1% below the potential entry.


See if Phillips 66 can punch through the entry in volume at least 40% above average.

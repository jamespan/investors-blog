Today we're going to look at **Five Below**, ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) which has carved out a unique niche in the retail market.

  

The chain store sells a variety of fun, trendy merchandise aimed at teens and preteens — things like stickers to decorate lockers, magnets, inexpensive clothing, games and low-priced basketballs. And they're all priced below $5 each.

  

Analysts say items like that at low prices have a big appeal to teenage consumers. And Five Below also does a very good job at hitting the major trends, which sets them apart from the competition.

  

The firm was profiled in a June 10 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/060713-659211-five-belowhits-home-run-with-teens-q1-sales-strong.htm), which noted Five Below faced head winds earlier this year including cold weather and a bite from payroll tax increases. But those head winds have started to dissipate and traffic and sales trends have strengthened.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings were up 200% in the quarter that ended in Oct. But that growth cooled to 26% last quarter.

  

• Sales growth has been steadier, ranging from 38% to 51% the past four quarters.

  

• Going forward, analysts see earnings rising 31% in the 2014 fiscal year, which ends in Jan., and 36% in fiscal 2015.

  

• The company came public in 2012. But before it made its stock market debut, it did have some earnings losses between 2008 and 2010.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

And those losses are still weighing on its Composite and EPS Ratings as you can see in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-five-below-inc-five.aspx).

  

In terms of its Composite Rating, it's ranked No. 4 among the five stocks in its industry group.

  

And the industry group itself is only ranked No. 137 among IBD's 197 groups. So it has not been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As we mentioned before, Five Below came public in July of last year.

  

The stock recently formed a cup-with-handle base as you can see on the MarketSmith chart above.

  

But you'll notice the mid-point between the low and the high in the handle was slightly below the mid-point of the overall base. And that's a flaw.

  

Breakouts from bases like that can work, but studies have shown they have greater chance of failing. So that's also something to be aware of.

  

Still, Five Below has an interesting business model and it may be one to watch to see how it behaves going forward.

In the 1990s, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) pioneered the online discount brokerage industry on its way to becoming one of the biggest stock market winners of the dot-com boom.









 
 
 Today, it may be getting ready to launch a new breakout move as it closes in on the 51.66 all-time high it hit back in April 1999. Of course, since the current bull market is now nearly nine years old, investors should also [keep a close eye on the general market](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) to watch for any signs of a top.
Schwab IMPACT 2017
------------------


Last week, the San Francisco-based company held its annual [Schwab IMPACT conference](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/schwab-urges-advisors-to-help-clients-navigate-rapidly-changing-world/), the industry's largest and longest-running gathering of registered independent advisors.


Schwab's head of advisor services, Bernie Clark, encouraged RIAs to "go beyond financial planning and portfolio management" and expand their circle of influence to include "new experts with additional types of specialization."


With a 97 Composite Rating, Schwab is tied with  **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) for No. 4 spot within the investment bankers and brokers industry group, which ranks No. 23 (up from 33 on Monday) among the 197 groups IBD tracks. Rival **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)) holds the No. 33 position.


Schwab earns a mix of [pass, neutral and fail ratings in IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). It comes up a bit short in terms of three-year annual growth rates for earnings (20%) and sales (13%), but earns passing marks for current year EPS growth estimates (25%) and annual pretax profit margin (39%).


Schwab also has solid grades in terms of institutional demand, including a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio. But the number of funds with a position in the stock dipped last quarter from 1,662 to 1,659.


Ready To Trigger New Breakout?
------------------------------


As part of a longer base-on-base formation, Schwab is working on a flat base with a 46.31 buy point. On Tuesday, the stock was up over 2% and closed just below the entry at 46.08.


The relative strength line is within striking distance of new high ground, and the stock has found good support along the 50-day and 10-day moving averages within the base.


See if Schwab can punch through the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.


E-Trade is also forming a flat base and was up 1% Tuesday, leaving it 2% below a 45.80 buy point. TD Ameritrade broke out on Sept. 27 and has been floating in and out of buy range since then. It's currently 4% above the 47.36 entry. The buy zone extends to 49.73.

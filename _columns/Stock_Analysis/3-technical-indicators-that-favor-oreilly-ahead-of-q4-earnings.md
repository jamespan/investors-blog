With Q4 earnings due next week, **O’Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is trying to rev its engines, fueled by a mix of favorable industry trends, solid fundamentals and three promising technical indicators.


As the [IBD Industry Themes](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/trend-lifts-auto-parts-demand-autozone-oreilly-near-highs/) column noted, O’Reilly, **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and other auto parts retailers are benefiting from lower gas prices, which encourage more driving, and aging vehicles. Both trends lead to more repairs, meaning more business for the auto parts industry.


Reliable Fundamentals
---------------------


In bumpy markets, fund managers look for stocks that have the best chances of providing a smooth ride, particularly in sales and earnings growth.


O’Reilly has delivered top-line quarterly growth that has ranged from 8% to 11% over the last eight reports. Earnings growth has come in between 18% and 28% during the same period.


Investors will get another look under O’Reilly’s hood on Feb. 10, when it releases fourth quarter numbers.


For 2015, analysts expect earnings growth to come in at 24%, followed by a 14% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


The stock’s A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and its rising fund ownership in recent quarters point to demand for the stock.


O’Reilly’s 98 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 ranking within the Retail/Wholesale - Auto Parts industry group, ahead of **LKQ** ([LKQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LKQ)) and **Pep Boys-Manny Moe Jack** ([PBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBY)), which was the target of a [bidding war](https://www.investors.com/news/pep-boys-down-after-icahn-wins-bidding-war/) last year between Japanese tire company Bridgestone and Carl Icahn. **Icahn Enterprises** ([IEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IEP)) emerged as the winner.


Refueling For New Run?
----------------------


Earnings season can be full of surprises, and even a stock showing strong chart action ahead of a report can end up skidding into the wall. But a week before its fourth-quarter announcement, O’Reilly Automotive is flashing three healthy technical signals.


[![ORLY-ISA-020216-Chart](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Markup_ORLY.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Markup_ORLY.jpg)


First, it reset its base count last month when it hit a new low that undercut the low in the prior pattern, making its current cup-shaped consolidation a first-stage base. Like a pit stop in a race, resetting a base count can refresh and refuel the stock for a new run.


Second, O’Reilly is showing signs of demand among mutual funds in the right side of its base. It got back above its 40-week and 10-week moving averages last week as volume spiked 52% higher than normal, a sign of institutional buying.


Third, O’Reilly’s relative strength line has moved into new high ground ahead of a potential breakout, a bullish sign showing that the stock is outperforming the rest of the market.


The buy point is 278.06, ten cents above the peak on the left. See if O’Reilly Automotive can deliver another quarter of solid growth and break past that entry on volume at least 40% above average.

As futurist [Gerd Leonhard](https://www.securityroundtable.org/contributor/gerd-leonhard/) wrote in an article for **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), "It is hard to overstate the dramatic impact that AI technology will have on the world in the coming years, including the world of cybersecurity." The company has already collaborated with such tech leaders as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) to secure the cloud and now top investors bet PANW stock stands to benefit from artificial intelligence.




[Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks](https://cloud.google.com/palo-alto-networks#:~:text=Our%20unique%20joint%20initiative%20combines,hybrid%20environments%20and%20Google%20Cloud.) teamed up earlier to provide organizations with a shared, end-to-end security model in a hybrid, multi-cloud world. In 2021, [Nvidia collaborated with Palo Alto Networks](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/12/palo-alto-networks-cyber-defenses/) to boost cyber defenses with a virtual next-generation firewall.


PANW Stock Soars Beyond Buy Zone
--------------------------------


The company's latest [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/panw-stock-palo-alto-earnings-q12023/) have helped propel PANW stock into and beyond a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/).


Additionally, in Security Roundtable, an online magazine on cybersecurity trends put out by Palo Alto Networks, Leonhard penned an article titled ["It's Time to Get Real About Artificial Intelligence.](https://www.securityroundtable.org/its-time-to-get-real-about-artificial-intelligence/)" The magazine also recently released ["What Kind of Artificial Intelligence Do You Need for Security?"](https://www.securityroundtable.org/what-kind-of-artificial-intelligence-do-you-need-for-security/) by [Greg Day,](https://www.securityroundtable.org/contributor/greg-day/) vice president and regional chief security officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Palo Alto Networks.


Day points out that artificial intelligence is a catchall term for a range of technologies. In terms of AI and cybersecurity, he states that three common uses come into play in this sphere: big data analytics, supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning.


Meanwhile, in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, [Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora called generative AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/palo-alto-networks-ceo-lauds-generative-ai-as-boon-for-efficiency-.html) a boon for customer satisfaction and company efficiency.


Clearly, AI technology is top of mind for the Silicon Valley-based powerhouse. As AI offers entirely new levels of cybersecurity to streamline an enterprise's operations, Palo Alto Networks continues to post impressive growth and secure undeniable [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-track-institutional-demand-to-find-winners/) for PANW stock.

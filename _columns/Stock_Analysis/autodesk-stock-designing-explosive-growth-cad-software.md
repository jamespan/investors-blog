Boosted by 650% earnings growth last quarter, is CAD software leader **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) designing a new breakout move? Autodesk stock is currently crafting an early-stage base and is within striking distance of a new buy zone.




Based in San Rafael, Calif., Autodesk pioneered computer-aided design (CAD), which helps architects, engineers and designers in all fields create 3D designs and more.


In June, Autodesk introduced [PlanGrid Advanced RFIs and Project Hub](http://investors.autodesk.com/news-releases/news-release-details/autodesk-introduces-plangrid-advanced-rfis-and-project-hub-boost), two new enhancements of its PlanGrid platform that give construction teams improved insight into the status and progress of their projects.

CAD Software Driving Explosive Growth For Autodesk Stock
--------------------------------------------------------


In the first quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended April 30, 2019), Autodesk posted a 650% spike in earnings. Prior to that report, the company had posted four quarters of triple-digit, accelerating EPS growth, but each of those was based on prior-year quarters that showed a loss. It's a positive sign to see Autodesk deliver a stellar fiscal Q1 that no longer has that caveat.


Analysts expect that growth to continue. For fiscal Q2, these market forecasters see Autodesk's EPS rising 226%, leading to a 180% increase for the full fiscal year.


Sales growth jumped 31% in fiscal Q1, but the company's three-year annual revenue growth is a much more staid 5%.


With a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) and a No. 15 industry group ranking (out of 197), Autodesk qualifies as one of the [top-rated stocks in a top-ranked industry group](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-find-the-top-rated-stocks-in-the-top-ranked-industries/).


On a more cautionary note, look for signs of institutional demand for Autodesk stock to improve. It currently has a D [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-helps/) and a 0.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/), below the 1.0 or higher score that indicates demand. Autodesk also saw a drop in the number of mutual funds with a position in the stock, from 1,633 to 1,510.


Can Autodesk Stock Engineer New Breakout?
-----------------------------------------


As a [stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/) hit in the fourth quarter of 2018, Autodesk [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in its prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Since then, the stock has continued to edge higher while forming additional consolidations. It's currently working on a flat base as part of series of bases near each other.


The buy point is 179.05.


On the positive side, Autodesk has retaken its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and its 10-day line is back above the 50-day benchmark. But note that volume on the stock's recent rebound has been below average, and its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is still short of new-high ground.


The stock is currently around 3% below a new buy zone. See if Autodesk can complete its new base and clear the entry in volume at least 40% above average.

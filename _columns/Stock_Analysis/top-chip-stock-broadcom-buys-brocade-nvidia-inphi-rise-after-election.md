Chip designer stocks like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) have been on the rise since Donald Trump's election win. Now **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is trying to get in on the action and break out.


The Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group ranks No. 8 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, with Inphi, Monolithic Power, Nvidia and **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) earning the No. 1 through No. 4 spots within the group, respectively.


While Broadcom currently ranks No. 5, the Singapore-based firm is the undisputed king of sales compared to the other top-rated chip designers.


Broadcom posted $3.8 billion in sales in its latest quarterly report, dwarfing the revenue for Inphi ($71 million) and Monolithic ($107 million).


Nvidia, which has risen sharply since the election and is now consolidating those gains, posted just over $2 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2017 third quarter, ended Oct. 30.


Broadcom is set to release results for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter on Dec. 8. Can it deliver a third straight quarter of triple-digit sales growth?


For the full fiscal year, analysts expect earnings to rise 25%, followed by a 20% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Yet Another Multibillion Dollar Buyout
--------------------------------------


On Nov. 2, Broadcom announced it will buy **Brocade Communications Systems** ([BRCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCD)) for $5.9 billion, strengthening its portfolio of enterprise storage and networking solutions.


Last year, Avago merged with Broadcom in a $37 billion deal that created today's iteration of the chip giant. That remains the largest merger in the semiconductor industry, still topping this summer's $32 billion buyout of ARM Holdings by Japan-based **Softbank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)).


Will Demand Kick In With Earnings Due?
--------------------------------------


Broadcom is working on a 13-week flat base as part of a longer-term, first-stage base-on-base formation.



While the stock has shown eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership, a 0.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio and D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating point to potentially weakening institutional demand.


The stock is showing an early entry at 178.12, but with such mixed signals – along with an earnings report scheduled for next week – investors should proceed with caution.


If Broadcom does report well and break out, look for particularly heavy volume to indicate conviction and enthusiasm among fund managers.


The stock closed Tuesday's session less than 2% below the 178.12 buy point.

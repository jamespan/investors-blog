With mutual fund managers and other large investors taking an interest in medical products makers, **Zimmer Biomet** ([ZBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBH)) has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks, along with industry peers **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **Edward Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)).


But on Tuesday, the stock fell below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume as the Nasdaq sold off sharply. It's a good reminder of why you should (1) wait for stocks to clear a proper buy point before jumping in, and (2) [always pay attention to the general market action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-smart-investor-never-forget-what-the-m-is-doing/).


As of Monday's close, the medical products industry ranked No. 22 among 197 groups, and Edwards Lifesciences, Align Technology, **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)), **LeMaitre Vascular** ([LMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMAT)) and **Vascular Solutions** ([VASC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VASC)) all made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-put-the-pedal-to-the-metal-with-gibraltar/).


While Zimmer Biomet did not make the cut, institutional demand for the stock is reflected in its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio and three straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


The stock's 97 Composite Rating also earns it a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), along with Edwards Lifesciences and **Boston Scientific** ([BSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSX)).


Seeking 'Signature Solution' To Growth
--------------------------------------


Zimmer Biomet, which was formed by the 2015 merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet, is a global leader in musculoskeletal health care.


In July, the Indiana-based company unveiled Signature Solutions, what it calls "a comprehensive suite of clinical services and technologies designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based health care models."


The move is in reaction to two major mandates launched last year in the U.S. under the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Act and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA).


Zimmer Biomet also noted that "Europe and Canada have also been actively passing similar policies that base reimbursement on patient and health economic outcomes."


Ready To Flex Its Muscles?
--------------------------


Zimmer Biomet is working on a flat base as part of a first-stage [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/), but Tuesday's action is putting that pattern to the test.



On Monday, the stock rose over 1% to close just below a 133.29 buy point. The relative strength line moved into new high ground and volume was rising, but below average.


On Tuesday, volume rose well above average as the stock failed to find support at the 10-week line.


See if Zimmer Biomet can rebound in strong volume to close the week above that benchmark. Also note that Zimmer Biomet is scheduled to release Q3 earnings on Oct. 31.

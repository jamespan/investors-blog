After some major changes, **Chesapeake Energy** ([CHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHK)) seems to be turning around.

  

And as a Dec. 2 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/112913-681111-chesapeake-energy-restructures-and-focuses-on-oil.htm) noted, much of that progress this year can be traced to the the firm's repositioning to focus more on oil than natural gas, a big change in management and a strategy of selling off noncore assets.

  

In fact, in the third quarter, its daily oil production was up 23% from a year ago, natural gas liquids were up 31% and natural gas production was down 10%.

  

Last year, when Chesapeake was trying to fill its cash flow shortage, it was forced to sell some assets at fire-sale prices. But this year sales have been made in a more paced manner and at better prices.

  

The company has also made some internal changes to keep costs under control and cut about 1,200 jobs.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

And so far that shakeup seems to be paying off.

  

• After a slowdown a few years back, earnings growth has been rebounding, coming in most recently at 330%. 

  

• Sales growth has also improved, hitting 64% last quarter. 

  

• Looking ahead, analysts see earnings rising 175% this year and 28% next year. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

But as you can see in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chesapeake-energy-chk.aspx) those past earnings problems are still weighing on its EPS Rating, which is only 76. That rating combines a company's recent earnings track record with its past one.

  

Chesapeake's Composite Rating is 83.

  

The stock is a member of the Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group. And that group is ranked No. 41 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Turning to the daily chart, Chesapeake sliced through the 50-day moving average line on heavy volume Nov. 6, in the wake of its latest earnings report.

  

Though its earnings growth met views and its sales beat them, investors seem to have been expecting more.

  

Since then the stock has been slowly retaking some of that lost territory. Watch to see if it can continue to climb and if it goes on to form a base pattern.

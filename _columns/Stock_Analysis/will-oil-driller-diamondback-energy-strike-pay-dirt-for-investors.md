Today we're going to look at **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)).

  

They're based in Midland, Texas and drill for oil and natural gas in the Permian Basin in west Texas.

  

Oil production in that area peaked in 1973 and then declined for decades. But new drilling technologies have helped boost production recently.

  

The firm's CEO said in a recent earnings conference call that Diamondback's Gridiron well in Midland County is the best well the company has drilled to date and appears to be one of the top-performing horizontal wells in the Midland Basin.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth was a little bumpy a few years ago but seems to be improving.

  

They weighed in with first-quarter earnings earlier this month. And though they missed estimates, earnings were up 342% from a year ago.

  

Sales growth has been in the triple digits for the past four quarters.

  

Looking ahead, analysts see earnings rising 117% this year and 36% next year.

  

Return on equity is 8%, which is less than the 17% minimum you look for.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Diamondback is working on an ascending base.

  

That's a rare pattern where each of the the lows in the consolidation are higher than the low in the previous one.

  

The 76.82 ideal buy point is calculated by adding 10 cents to the peak on the left side of this most recent dip.

  

But remember, with the market in a correction, it's not a good time to be buying stocks.

  

Still, Diamondback may be one to keep an eye on when the next market uptrend comes around to see if it can break out of its base and launch a new climb.

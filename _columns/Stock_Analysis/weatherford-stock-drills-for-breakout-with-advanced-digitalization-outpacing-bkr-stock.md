Fueled by stellar [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) for the group leaders, the Oil & Gas-Equipment/Services group ranks No. 7 among the 197 industries IBD tracks. Sharing the highest-possible 99 rating with **Baker Hughes** ([BKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKR)),  **Archrock** ([AROC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AROC)) and **TechnipFMC** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)), **Weatherford** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) and its peers are fueling new breakouts and buy zones.




Recent action in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) has provided a boost. The Nasdaq has soared back above its 200-day moving average and the S&P 500 has followed suit. Now both indexes are trying to decisively jump back above their 50-day moving averages.


Meanwhile, [Weatherford](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-weatherford-intl-wfrd.aspx), [Baker Hughes](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-baker-hughes-bkr.aspx) and other top [oil & gas sector stock](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/)s continue to prime [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in this nascent uptrend. That has put Weatherford on the [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) screen and BKR stock on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


WFRD stock has just drilled into new buy zone, building on its bounce off its 50-day line.


Weatherford stacks up well against Baker Hughes and other oil stocks in the group in terms of institutional demand. Weatherford joined Baker Hughes on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/is-the-ai-boom-over-this-shows-the-top-funds-dont-think-so/). WFRD stock tops its peers with a A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and very impressive 2.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).

Weatherford Barrels Ahead With Digitalization
---------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Houston, Weatherford provides equipment and technology for oil and gas drilling and production worldwide. It operates in roughly 75 countries, with about 18,000 team members across 340 operating locations.


To optimize efficiency across the energy sector, the company focuses on creating solutions that [digitize fields and automate operations](https://www.weatherford.com/portfolio-capabilities/digitalization-and-automation-solutions/).


Building on a strong turnaround spanning a string of quarters, Weatherford reported earnings of $1.66 a share in the third quarter. That represented a huge year-over-year gain of 315%. Wall Street expects that trend to continue with a 490% EPS gain for the full year.


On the sales front, Weatherford continued to produce solid double-digit increases. In Q3, the company generated 17% year-over-year growth to over $1.3 billion.


WFRD Stock Outpaces BKR In Race To Breakout
-------------------------------------------


On Thursday, Weatherford  climbed past a 97.88 buy point in an early stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). Even before the breakout, WFRD stock has already seen its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) enter new-high ground. Weatherford has posted multiple up days in above-average volume while forming the base, another sign of demand. The stock held tight Friday to close in buy range.


Baker Hughes stock is also crafting a new chart pattern, a first-stage flat base with a 37.58 entry. The stock is now pushing to retake its 50-day line.


Oil industry peer TechnipFMC has now entered a buy zone. Having just reported a 100% spike in earnings for Q3, Archrock continues to rally above its 50-day line, jumping into a buy zone after clearing 13.79 buy point.

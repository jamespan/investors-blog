With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, six stocks share top billing in the enterprise software industry group, including **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)). **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)), which has just jumped into a new buy zone, also joins this elite list.









 
 
 Paycom and ServiceNow are extended beyond buy range from earlier breakouts, as are **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) and **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)), both of which also earn a 99 Composite Rating,
Salesforce.com, which provides customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, is trying to retake the 109.29 buy point it initially cleared on Jan. 9.


Triple-Digit Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------------


LogMeIn is a leader in remote-access software, pitting it against giant rivals **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Last year, LogMeIn completed a reverse merger with the GoToMeeting business of **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)), and earlier this month, it [agreed to buy Jive Communications](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/02/08/logmein-pays-up-to-357-for-rival-to-boston-based.html) in a deal that could ultimately cost $367 million.

The Boston-based company has delivered average EPS growth of 118% over the last three quarters, including a 107% spike in Q3. Analysts are looking for an 88% rise when LogMeIn reports Q4 earnings after the close today.


Sales growth has also been impressive and accelerating, coming in between 135% and 216% over the last three quarters.


LogMeIn's 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% return on equity are two more signs it's a very well-run company.


Pre-Earnings Breakout
---------------------


On Tuesday, LogMeIn jumped over 3% in volume more than double its daily average, closing the day 1% above a 128.45 entry.



Keep in mind that it is risky to buy any breakout stock just before an earnings report. It's generally better to wait and see what kind of numbers the company reports and how the market reacts.


LogMeIn's rising relative strength line is near new high ground, a sign of market leadership. The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has now improved to a B+ and its up/down volume ratio has jumped to a solid 1.6, indicating rising institutional demand.


Early Thursday, LogMeIn was up over 2%, putting towards the upper end of the buy range, which extends to 134.87. Salesforce was also up more than 2% and back above its prior buy point.

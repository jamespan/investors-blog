**Envestnet** ([ENV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENV)) makes Internet-based wealth management software for financial advisors. That technology helps advisors find and research investments and manage their client’s wealth

  

Last year the firm bought the Wealth Management Solutions division of Prudential Investments.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth has been cooling the past few quarters, though it’s still above the 25% minimum level often seen in top companies.  In the second quarter earnings climbed 38%. 

  

Sales growth during the past four quarters has ranged from 64% to 68%. 

  

Looking ahead, analysts see earnings climbing 37% this year and 43% next year.  
   
There’s been some interest from big investors and the number of funds owning the stock has increased in recent quarters. 

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Earlier this summer the stock broke out of a long double-bottom base and started to climb. 

  

But before it made it very far, Envestnet pulled back to form another base pattern. 

  

That current base may shape up to be a flat base, but right now it’s too early to tell. Still, with the market in a new uptrend Envestnet may be one for your watch list.

  

One other thing to keep in mind is that, on average, Envestnet trades under 400,000 shares a day. Thinner stocks like this can be prone to big swings, both up and down.

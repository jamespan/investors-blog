While shoppers on the West Coast may not be as familiar with **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) as they are with **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and the Sam's Club unit of **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), BJ's is the leading operator of membership warehouse clubs in the Eastern United States. And it's among the [best IPO stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) from this year's crop of initial public offerings.




Based in Massachusetts, BJ's Wholesale Club operates more than 215 clubs and 135 gas stations in 16 states. With over 5 million members, the company generates around $12.5 billion in annual revenue.


By comparison, Costco posted $31.6 billion in revenue for just its latest fiscal quarter (ended May 13). The Issaquah, WA-based company operates 750 warehouses around the world. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2018, Walmart division Sam's Club reported $59 billion in annual revenue. In January, Sam's Club said it was [closing 63 locations](https://www.investors.com/news/wal-mart-abruptly-closes-63-sams-club-stores-on-same-day-as-broad-wage-hike/) across the U.S. on the same day Walmart announced wage hikes and employee bonuses.

From Private Equity To IPO
--------------------------


In 2011, BJ's Wholesale Club was taken private by two private equity firms, Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital. The company returned to the public markets with its IPO in June.


Over the last three quarters, BJ's has posted average earnings growth of 171%. But note that the 124% EPS gain in its most recently reported quarter was based on comparisons to a prior-year quarter that showed a loss. The company is set to release its fiscal 2018 Q2 numbers before the market open on Aug. 28.


BJ's Wholesale Club holds the No. 5 spot among [discount retailer stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/). [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) holds the top slot, followed by **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)). The discount and variety retail group ranks No. 15 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Since its IPO, 166 funds have reported taking a position in BJ's Wholesale Club, 131 of which have an A- or higher rating. The stock has not been trading long enough to establish an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-institutional-accumulation/), which tracks institutional buying and selling over the trailing 13 weeks.


In July, BJ's Wholesale Club announced online shoppers can now use **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), PayPal Credit and PayPal OneTouch to [make purchases on BJs.com](http://bjs.mediaroom.com/2018-07-09-BJs-Wholesale-Club-Makes-Online-Checkout-Faster-with-PayPal).


Best IPO Stocks To Watch
------------------------


BJ's is trying to secure its place among the best IPO stocks of 2018 by clearing a 27.56 buy point in its first base since going public on June 28. On Monday, the stock rose 2.5% to 26.36, leaving it just under 5% below the entry.


On Tuesday, BJ's Wholesale Club rose to as high as 27.30, but gave back the bulk of those gains to close at 26.41, ending the day 3% below the buy point.



Costco has continued to climb and hit a new all-time high of 230.10 Tuesday before easing back to close at 228.54. Sam's Club owner Walmart is working on the right side of a base currently showing a 110.08 entry. On Monday, Ollie's Bargain Outlet tried to break out as it rose over 4% to 77.65, but closed the day just below the 77.60 entry in rising and above-average volume. On Tuesday, Ollie's bounced back into the buy zone, which extends to 81.48. Note that it's a riskier, later-stage pattern.

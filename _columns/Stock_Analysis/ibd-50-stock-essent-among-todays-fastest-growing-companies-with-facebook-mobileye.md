 When looking for the best stocks to buy, start by seeing what the top fund managers are buying. One stock they've been scooping up recently is **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)).
The provider of private mortgage insurance made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-new-stock-buys-broadcom-essent-banks/), along with fellow financial sector stock **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and top tech leaders **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


Essent's 68.1% pretax profit margin also earned it a spot on IBD's list of [six stocks with 50%-plus profit margins](https://www.investors.com/research/most-profitable-stocks-facebook-alibaba-mobileye/), joined by **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)).


Facebook, Mobileye and fellow IBD 50 member **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) also joined Essent on a list of [today's fastest growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/).


50%-Plus Sales & Earnings Growth
--------------------------------


Essent's exceptional growth is what attracts fund managers. The Bermuda-based company has strong three-year annual growth rates for both sales (50%) and earnings (51%), no significant long-term debt and a solid 18.1% return on equity.


Institutional demand for the stock is further indicated by a 1.7 up/down volume ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


New Base Forming
----------------


While Essent just barely undercut the low in a prior base in November to technically [reset the base count,](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-how-to-count-bases) it wasn't the type of definitive reset button that a stock usually pushes to launch a fresh start. So keep in mind the significant advance Essent has already made since truly bottoming out in February 2016.


The stock broke out in January, but soon pulled back to begin forming its current flat base as part of a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-base-on-base).


Essent has found support at the 10-week line and is now trying to work its way up to the 38.20 buy point.


On Friday, the stock slipped, but found support at and bounced off its 10-day moving average to recoup most of the day's losses. Volume was below average.


See if the Relative Strength line can move into new high ground as Essent tries to clear the entry in volume at least 40% above average.

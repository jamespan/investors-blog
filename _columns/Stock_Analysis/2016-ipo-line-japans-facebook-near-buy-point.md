In a very **[busy week for initial public offerings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apptio-trade-desk-part-of-busiest-week-for-ipos-this-year/)** from **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Apptio** ([APTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APTI)), **e.l.f. Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) and others, July IPO **Line** ([LN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LN)) has surged to retake a prior buy point.


Known as "Japan's Facebook," Line is part of a notable group of 2016 IPOs that includes **Acacia** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Cotiviti** ([COTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COTV)).


While **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) crushes the social media competition in most of the world, Line's messaging service dominates in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. But member growth, which was just 1% last year, remains a concern.


As of April, Line had 218 million monthly active users — a number dwarfed by Facebook-owned properties WhatsApp and Messenger, both with over 1 billion.


Yet despite basically flat user growth, Line has been increasing sales and profits. Revenue jumped 62% in Q2, while earnings spiked 400%, the company's fourth straight quarter of triple-digit gains.


Games have been a key revenue driver for Line, whose playful and quirky design sense is very much a part of Japan's "kawaii" (cute) culture. Earlier this month, Line released "Line Fighters," a "ferociously cute" action role-playing game (RPG).


Where Do You Draw The Line?
---------------------------


The key to understanding chart patterns and buy points is to look for areas of [**support and resistance**](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/).


On Aug. 15, Line broke out of an **[IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/)** with a 44.59 entry, created by a point of resistance that the stock hit on its July 14 debut. But the stock hit a ceiling around 48 and sold off sharply, falling 8% below the pivot.



After bouncing back to retake the earlier buy point, Line hit resistance at 45.34, establishing a more aggressive entry, which it cleared on Friday in above-average volume. The buy zone extends to 47.71.


Investors should also see if the stock goes on to create an additional buying opportunity at 48.20, or 10 cents above the peak that it hit last month.

**Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) is quickly building up the right side of a new base. The current action has some positives as well as a red flag.

  

The stock cleared a 70.79 buy point from a base-on-base pattern in early April 1.

  

But four weeks later it reversed from a new high and sliced its 10-week line in huge trade 2.

  

Under Armour consolidated below its 10-week moving average for several weeks. Last week, the stock regained its 10-week line in big volume 3. The volume surge suggests institutional buying. Such buying — from mutual funds and hedge funds — can send stocks significantly higher over time.

  

Another positive is that Under Armour's relative strength line is already at a new high, while price is still several percentage points below 4.

  

On a down note, Under Armour is developing a later-stage pattern. These types of bases are riskier, as the stock has already had a long, sharp advance.

  

Those who want in may already be in, and only a few buyers might be left on the sidelines.

  

Generally, first- or second-stage patterns are preferred.

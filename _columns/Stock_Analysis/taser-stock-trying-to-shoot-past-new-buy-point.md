As news headlines have focused on altercations with the police in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore, and McKinney, Texas, investors have focused on companies that can help law enforcement officers better handle such situations.

  

**Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)), which makes non-lethal smart weapons and body cameras, is one such firm.

  

After starting with stun guns, Taser has expanded its revenue streams to include wearable Axon cameras and digital evidence management tools to help police departments track, share and analyze their interactions with the community.

  

Competitors include **Digital Ally** ([DGLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DGLY)) and **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), which also make body-worn cameras for law enforcement. And last month, Panasonic said it's coming out with a next-generation Arbitrator camera and enhanced Unified Evidence Management System.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth accelerated last quarter from 17% to 24%. And on Wednesday, Taser said [25 agencies ordered its next-generation Smart Weapons in Q2](http://news.investors.com/business/061715-757679-taser-gets-new-orders-for-stun-guns.htm), many with accompanying camera systems.

  

The Q1 jump in earnings was even more impressive, spiking from -10% to a 117% gain.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 32%, followed by a 22% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Taser's return on equity just meets the 17% minimum you look for, and overall it scores the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

Large investors have been picking up shares as the stock works on a base and that's reflected in the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Taser cleared a sloppy base-on-base formation in November, making a nice move until it pulled back to start forming a new pattern in January.

  

It sold off in February, after reporting a sharp drop in Q4 earnings due to rising costs related to boosting overseas revenue and its line of Axon body cameras.

  

But the stock regrouped and flashed several weeks of tight closes â€” a sign that support was shoring up.

  

Taser broke out in April and is now working on a new base. It's shallower than the prior pattern and the Relative Strength line is in new high ground.

  

But it is a [later-stage base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/757525-buy-early-not-late.htm) and those tend to be riskier than first- or second-stage patterns.

  

The buy point is 35.10, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

Since June 10, Taser has made multiple attempts to clear that price, but has struggled to gain traction.

  

On Wednesday, it again tried to break out, but closed below the buy point. Volume was rising, but still well below average.

  

See if Taser can shoot decisively above the buy point on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

  

Keep in mind the buying range is up to 5% above the ideal buy point. For Taser, that's from 35.10 to 36.86.

  

As of early Thursday morning, the stock was again back in the buy zone.

Although **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has just broken out to notch a record high, the artificial intelligence giant once again failed to make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-broadcom-stock-avgo-palantir-nvidia/). But these top money managers went all in on a rival AI play: **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


And as shares of [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/) climb to the top of its buy range, Broadcom stock is teasing a new breakout of its own.


Plus, a just-unveiled industry-first in AI networking beyond the data center promises to expand demand for Broadcom. But investors should keep in mind that both of these AI semiconductor giants share one point of caution.




Broadcom Stock Garners Massive Demand
-------------------------------------


Showing that the AI boom keeps on rolling, top-performing funds scooped up a whopping $17.2 billion worth of Broadcom stock in the latest report. That more than doubled the $7.7 billion they invested in fellow AI leader **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), which came in second place.


In other signs of demand, Broadcom earns a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/).


After bolting out to an [all-time high on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-palantir-earnings-news-q32024/), Palantir has spiked to a 2.9 up/down volume ratio and A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating. But an impressive 310 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares of Broadcom stock. Only 22 such funds have a position in Palantir.


By comparison, Nvidia has 1.4 up/down volume ratio and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Topping Broadcom, 370 A+ funds own Nvidia.


With Nvidia AWOL again, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) was the only Magnificent Seven member to make this month's screen. [Meta stock also made the list in October](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-meta-stock-ignore-nvidia-other-magnificent-seven-stocks/).


Growth Accelerates
------------------


Both Broadcom and Nvidia hail from the fabless semiconductor group. Nvidia holds a slight lead among the industry leaders with a [98 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.aspx). [Broadcom earns a 97 rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-broadcom-avgo.aspx).


Nvidia faces the most immediate test with earnings due Nov. 20. But Broadcom is not far behind with its next report scheduled for Dec. 5.


Analysts expect Broadcom to build on its recent growth. For the [third quarter of fiscal 2024](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/avgo-stock-broadcom-earnings-fiscal-q3-2024/), ended on Aug. 4, Broadcom generated 47% revenue growth to $13.1 billion and an earnings increase of 18% to $1.24 per share.


Analysts see that earnings acceleration continuing in each of the next three reports. When the company unveils fiscal Q4 numbers next month, Wall Street forecasts 26% earnings growth to $1.39 per share.


Industry-First For Robust AI Networking
---------------------------------------


As a leading chip designer, Broadcom serves a range of critical markets, including cloud, data center, networking, broadband, wireless, storage and enterprise software.


On Tuesday, [Broadcom unveiled VeloRAIN](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/62666), the latest addition to its VeloCloud portfolio. VeloRAIN aims to accelerate an enterprise's readiness to further connect and support AI and non-AI workloads. Calling it an industry-first for AI networking beyond the data center, it ties in with Broadcom's push for vertical industry adoption of generative AI.


The chip designer believes GenAI can help enterprises ​​drive gains in productivity while reducing the cost of automating manual-intensive processes.


Broadcom Stock And Nvidia: A Word Of Caution
--------------------------------------------


Since retreating from an earlier 185.16 buy point in a consolidation pattern, Broadcom stock is once again targeting that entry. After bouncing off the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on Election Day, the stock jumped back above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Wednesday and continues to rise.


Broadcom closed the week just 1% shy of a return to buy range.


But investors should note that, as with Nvidia, Broadcom's [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/) is late-stage. Such bases can generate good gains, especially as the Nasdaq and tech stocks rally. But they entail more risk. By definition, a stock has already made a substantial move by the time third-, fourth- and even [later-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/) form.


Nvidia's breakout last month came from a fourth-stage pattern.


Also note that both Broadcom and Nvidia have earnings ahead, adding an extra call for caution.

**Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) rode an 11-day win streak from lows to come within striking distance of a new high as a new buy point emerges.


In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales growth jumped 47% and 31%, respectively. The Boston company's quarterly earnings and revenue track record is going strong, and analysts don't expect it to slow down anytime soon. Annual earnings estimates, which analysts have  revised upward recently, are anticipated to surge 43% in the fiscal year ending in September and 21% in the next fiscal year.


Since fiscal 2014, when annual earnings declined about 2%, quarterly earnings and sales have had double-digit increases over the last eight consecutive quarters, leading to the stock's 95 EPS Rating.


The semiconductor manufacturing industry group has been one of the leading industry groups for months; six weeks ago, the group was ranked No. 38. Currently, the group is [ranked No. 33 out of 197 groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-apr-12-2017/). Within the industry group, Macom is [ranked No.1](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-macom-tech-solution-hldg-mtsi.aspx) using the IBD Composite Rating, which blends key fundamental and technical metrics.


Q2 earnings are expected after the close on April 25. Consensus estimates are for earnings per share of 61 cents on revenues totaling $182.7 million.



Over the past 22 months, the stock has been in a choppy uptrend, underscored by two corrections of more than 35%. However, its current base is much shallower, 20% deep, and its price swings are much less volatile. After this week's mild decline on below average volume, the [IBD 50 member](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has etched a short handle onto its cup-shaped base, moving the entry from 53.90 to 52.32.


While the stock's relative strength line, the blue line painted on IBD daily and weekly charts, has spiked upward the last few weeks, it remains off its highs set in December. Ideally, the relative strength line should reach a new high before or as the stock breaks out of a sound base.


Institutional sponsorship remains strong with four quarters of rising fund ownership and heavy volume increases over the last four weeks have brought the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating to a solid B+. What to look for: a strong breakout over its 52.32 entry as volume surges above average.

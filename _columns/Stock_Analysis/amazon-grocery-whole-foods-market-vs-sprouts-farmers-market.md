When **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) was founded in 2002, it probably didn't see **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) as a direct rival. But that changed with the rise of the Amazon grocery business when the retail giant bought Whole Foods Market in 2017.




Even before Amazon purchased Whole Foods, Team Bezos had been moving into groceries. In 2007, it launched AmazonFresh, allowing customers to order groceries online and have them delivered to their doorsteps. Amazon now offers its millions of Amazon Prime members unique discounts for shopping at Whole Foods Market online and in stores.


With the Alexa voice-controlled virtual assistant, customers can also now easily add their shopping list items to their cart and checkout. Plus, in over 60 cities across the U.S., Amazon Prime members can order grocery deliveries through Prime Now. And in over 10 cities, Prime members can place an order through the app and pick up their groceries at a Whole Foods store within 30 minutes.

Amazon Grocery Business Vs. Sprouts Farmers Market
--------------------------------------------------


Sprouts Farmers Market specializes in fresh, natural and organic products. The Phoenix-based retailer has over 28,000 employees and operates more than 300 stores in 17 states.


Despite increased competition from Amazon and the changing landscape of the grocery industry, Sprouts has managed to holds its ground and keep growing. The Phoenix, Ariz.-based company has posted seven straight quarters of double-digit sales growth. Earnings gains have ranged from 10% to 52% over the same period.


The exact size of the Amazon grocery business is unknown because Amazon doesn't provide breakout earnings and revenue numbers yet for Whole Foods Market. Prior to Amazon's purchase in August 2017, Whole Foods reported $3.7 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2017 third quarter (ended July 2).


In Q3 of 2018, Sprouts Farmers Market generated $1.3 billion in sales.


Stocks To Watch During A Market Correction
------------------------------------------


As a highly rated stock forming a [new chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), Sprouts is among the top [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) as we wait for a new uptrend to begin.


In Monday morning trade, the stock was once again testing support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). See if it can close the day above that benchmark line. Sprouts' [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remains within striking distance of a new high.


Another positive sign is how the supermarkets industry groups ranks No. 10 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. With a 99 Composite Rating, Sprouts earns the No. 1 ranking among its industry peers.


Signs of institutional demand include an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/). But note that the number of funds with a position in the stock dipped in Q3, from 510 to 506. See if new mutual funds pick up shares in the coming quarters.


More Sprouts Stock Chart Analysis
---------------------------------



Keep an eye on how Sprouts Farmers Market behaves near its [long-term point of resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-resistance-in-stocks-this-chinese-leader-overcame-it-broke-out/) around 29. The stock has failed to punch through that ceiling multiple times since 2016. The most recent instance was in September, when Sprouts briefly cleared that price, then pulled back to form its [current base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


The stock is continuing to work on an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 29.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). See if it can decisively clear that entry and turn that ceiling of resistance around 29 into a [floor of support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) that sustains a new climb.

Biotech stocks and drugmakers like **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) took a beating in September when Hillary Clinton accused Big Pharma of price gouging.

  

But **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) has now bounced back into a buy zone.

  

The New York-based drugmaker develops treatments for eye ailments, inflammatory diseases and cancer.

  

Earlier this week, Regeneron and partner **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) presented positive results from a pivotal phase-three study of sarilumab, an investigational human antibody to treat rheumatoid arthritis.

  

Last month, the company announced European Union approval for use of its Eylea eye injection for treatment of visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV).

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Regeneron's 98 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 spot among its peers in the biomed/biotech industry group, which currently ranks No. 54 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

Other big-name biotech stocks, such as **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), are still recovering from the medical meltdown in September.

  

On Nov. 4, Regeneron posted Q3 earnings growth that spiked from 17% to 38% and topped estimates. Sales growth also accelerated, from 50% to 57%.

  

The company raised its outlook, but expense guidance also rose, and [sales of its Praluent cholesterol drug disappointed](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/110915-779911-top-biotech-in-buy-range.htm).

  

Regeneron has a strong 52% return on equity and 92% annual EPS growth rate.

  

That's attracted the interest of professional investors, and the number of funds with a position in the stock has risen from 1,319 to 1,437 over the last two quarters.

  

Plus, five typically better-performing mutual funds have a position in Regeneron, including Fidelity Contrafund and T Rowe Price New Horizons .

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In August 2014, the stock launched a new run that sparked a gain of over 60% in less than a year.

  

It then began forming a [double bottom](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/netflix-double-bottom-breakout-ibd-investing-show-excerpt/), which is a first-stage consolidation since it [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/getting-started-chart-patterns-double-bottom/) when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.

  

Regeneron formed the second leg down in the base when Clinton accused drugmakers of price gouging and outlined a plan to end it.

  

But note how the stock found support at the 40-week line and quickly recaptured its 10-week moving average.

  

The buy point is 557.97, 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the "W."

  

Regeneron cleared that entry on Oct. 27, one week before earnings were due.

  

But volume was light, coming in 6% below average. That was well off the 40% or higher spike in trading you want to see on the day of a breakout.

  

When Regeneron reported the next week, it temporarily shot higher, but reversed to close in the bottom half of the price range.

  

While not ideal, it's not unusual for a stock to return to the buy point after breaking out. And so far, Regeneron has found support right around the entry price.

  

See if the stock can hold its ground and move higher in heavier volume.

  

The buying range is 557.97-585.87. As of Thursday morning, Regeneron was still trading within that zone.

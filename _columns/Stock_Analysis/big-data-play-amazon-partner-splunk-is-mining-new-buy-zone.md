Earning the No. 1 ranking among Big Data analytics firms, **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) partner **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) is mining for a new breakout. Can Splunk stock drill its way into a buy zone as it gets ready to report Q2 earnings in August?




Splunk is among the [top-rated stocks in the top-ranked industry groups](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-find-the-top-rated-stocks-in-the-top-ranked-industries/), with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) and placement within the No. 12-ranked data analytics industry. Fellow leading Big Data stocks include **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)), **Open Text** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)), **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)), **Progressive Software** ([PRGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGS)), and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)).

Big Data Analytics Stock Mining Solid Revenue Gains
---------------------------------------------------


Over the last eight quarters, Splunk has generated sales growth ranging from 32% to 50%. The San Francisco-based company has posted average annual revenue gains of 38% for the last three years.


Last quarter, it delivered earnings growth of 129%, but that was based on a prior-year quarter that showed a loss. Splunk made a recent list of stocks expecting [Q2 earnings growth ranging from 50% to 550%](https://www.investors.com/research/q2-earnings-preview-16-stocks-to-watch-expect-50-to-550-growth/), with analysts looking for the data analytics leader to deliver a 50% gain. Market watchers expect the company to report in the second half of August.


Splunk has been struggling to show stronger [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-i-in-can-slim-make-sure-top-fund-managers-are-backing-your-stock-picks/). The number of funds with a position in the stock fell last quarter, and it currently has a mediocre C [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-helps/) and a 0.8 up/down volume ratio, below the 1.0 benchmark that indicates demand. Look for those gauges to improve as Splunk stock continues to approach a possible new breakout.


Will Big Data Drive Big Breakout?
---------------------------------


Splunk has been on a bumpy ride since pulling back in June of last year. Along the way, it [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in a prior pattern. The stock formed a new [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) and broke out, but soon headed lower once more.


While finding support at its 40-week moving average and retaking its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/), Splunk is now trying to complete a streak of six up weeks in a row. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been trending higher as Splunk tries to complete a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) base showing a 140.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


On Thursday, Splunk edged lower but still closed within the upper half of the day's price range. Volume was below average. See if the stock can clear the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.


On Friday, Splunk reversed to close fractionally lower at 138.14, leaving it just shy of the new entry.

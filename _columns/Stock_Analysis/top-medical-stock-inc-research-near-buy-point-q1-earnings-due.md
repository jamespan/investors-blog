Since the FDA approval process can make or break biotech,  pharmaceutical and medical device maker stocks, it's no surprise that clinical research organizations (CROs) that conduct the related trials can be quite profitable.


**INC Research** ([INCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCR)) is a case in point. The Raleigh, NC-based CRO has a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 228%, and over the last three quarters, it’s posted average earnings growth of 120%.


INC holds the No. 1 ranking within the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group, ahead of **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), C**harles River Labs International** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)), **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) and **Luminex** ([LMNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMNX)).


INC’s sales growth has not been as robust as its earnings, but revenue accelerated from 17% to 23% last quarter. First-quarter numbers are expected later this month.


Signs of demand for the stock include a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio and five straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


One yellow flag is the company’s 217% debt-to-equity ratio, which could hurt cash flow and profits if interest rates rise and the cost of servicing that debt increases significantly.


Big Volume, Rising RS Line As Buy Point Nears

[![ISA-incr-041516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ISA-incr-041516-300x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ISA-incr-041516.jpg)After being taken private by Avista Capital Partners in 2010, INC returned to the public market with an IPO in November 2014. It made nearly a three-fold gain before peaking in August, as **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) and other drugmaker stocks sank on a tweet from Hillary Clinton accusing them of price gouging.


INC is now working on a cup-shaped base with a 50.50 buy point. The pattern could also be viewed as a longer double bottom with the same entry price.


Although the 10-week line remains below the 40-week moving average, the stock has flashed signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, including a big spike in volume last week.  The Relative Strength line is nearing new high ground ahead of a potential breakout.

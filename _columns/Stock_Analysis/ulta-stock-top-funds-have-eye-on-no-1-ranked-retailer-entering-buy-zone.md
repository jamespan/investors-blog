Top funds have their eye on cosmetics and hair care retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) as the company walks the runway into a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). Making the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-report-apple-googl-microsoft-under-pressure-while-vertex-lilly-weather-market-storm/), ULTA stock is showcasing a fresh [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).




Ulta Beauty earns top billing among its peers in the specialty [retailers](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) group, although its 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) earns just a neutral score in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ulta-beauty-inc-ulta.aspx).


The industry, which includes companies ranging from **Sally Beauty** ([SBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBH)) to **Petco Health & Wellness** ([WOOF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOOF)), currently ranks a lowly 116 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Ulta Beauty Rebound On 'Target'
-------------------------------


Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., selling both mass and prestige cosmetics, fragrances, skin care and hair care products. Featuring over 25,000 products at more than 1,300 stores and its online shop, the company also offers salon services.


As noted in [Ulta Beauty's March 2022 Investor Presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_8abff70332896e8fbc7ed6a71884f662/ulta/db/1912/18096/pdf/IR+deck+March+2022_032422.pdf), Ulta supercharges its customer acquisition with a partnership with **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and the Ulta Beauty product assortment and experience at Target stores.


After several quarters of weak sales and earnings during the worst of the pandemic, Ulta Beauty has begun to fix those blemishes. In its last three reports, the company has posted quarterly earnings growth ranging from 57% to 519%. Sales growth has ranged from 24% to 65% over the last four quarters.


In its [fiscal Q4 earnings report](https://www.ulta.com/investor/news-events/press-releases/detail/147/ulta-beauty-announces-fourth-quarter-fiscal-2021-results) for the period ended Jan. 29, Ulta noted it opened six new stores during the quarter, including locations in Georgia, California, Mississippi, and Washington. During fiscal 2021, the company opened 48 new stores, relocated seven stores, remodeled nine stores, and closed four locations.


ULTA Stock In Buy Zone Spotlight
--------------------------------


In January, Ulta Beauty [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in its prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). That made Ulta's current [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) a first-stage base.


ULTA stock recently cleared the 408.83 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and remains in a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). While volume has been tepid, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has jumped to a new high.


Meanwhile, fellow retail partner Target has also reset its base count as it aims to build a new base. But with its 50-day line well below the 200-day benchmark, Target has more technical work to do than ULTA stock. The stock ended the shortened trading week by retaking its 200-day line.


Look for the volume in Ulta Beauty to pick up as it continues to trade within the buy zone, which extends to around 429.27.

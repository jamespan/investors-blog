While **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is hoping it can mimic **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and bounce back from a disappointing IPO, payment processor **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) has already made a nice run — and may be getting ready to take off again.









 
 
 Like Facebook and Snap, Square got off to a slow start following its November 2015 initial public offering.
After about 14 months of roller coaster action, Square finally launched a solid run at the beginning of this year, rising as much as 87% before pulling back from the all-time high of 27.97 that it hit on July 27.


Interestingly, it took Facebook about the same amount of time from its May 2012 IPO until the social media giant launched its big move with a July 2013 breakout. It remains to be seen if Snap can pull off that same feat.


Taking A Page From Amazon
-------------------------


Based in San Francisco, Square provides point-of-sale payment processing solutions that help merchants of all sizes start, run and grow their businesses. Founded in 2009, the company has expanded internationally, with offices in Canada, Japan, Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom.


Just as e-commerce behemoth **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has entered the brick-and-mortar world with its purchase of **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)) and the opening of physical bookstores and Amazon Go grocery stores, Square unveiled its first retail location on Thursday in Manhattan.


Called Square Showroom, Bloomberg reports that the concept is "[akin to an Apple Genius Bar for retailers and other merchants](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-24/square-opens-first-brick-and-mortar-store-to-lure-more-sellers)," showcasing Square's lineup of payment solutions and how retailers can use them to streamline and grow their businesses.


250% Earnings Growth
--------------------


Heading into its Q2 earnings report, Square had already posted four straight quarters of triple-digit EPS gains, but those were all based on comparisons to quarters with losses. The company showed it could still deliver despite tougher comparisons by posting a 250% year-over-year increase for the second quarter.


Sales growth has increased over the last three reports from 21% to 26%, but Square's 1% pretax profit margin and 2.8% return on equity are less impressive.


Those lagging numbers help explain why Square didn't join payment processing peers **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) on the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Visa sports a 64.2% profit margin and 21.9% ROE, while the numbers for PayPal are 20.5% and 12.8%, respectively.


Still, six consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership show institutional demand for shares of Square.


Steppingstone For New Climb?
----------------------------


Square has been consolidating since the end of July and may be getting ready to take a swipe at another breakout.


Friday closes out the fifth week in a potential new base, with the stock testing support at its 10-week line in the bottom of the pattern.


Also note how that area of support is right around the buy point in its earlier flat base — a sign it may be forming steppingstones for a continued climb.



While the buy point may change as the stock builds the right side of the consolidation, 28.07 is one possible entry.


Look for Square to show signs of accumulation and for the relative strength line to approach new high ground as the stock tries to complete and break out of the new base.


On Friday, Square was down over 2% and just pennies below its 50-day moving average. Volume was below average, but rising slightly, so see keep a close eye on that next week.

 While leading Chinese internet stocks **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) have already broken out, **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) may be getting ready to follow suit.
The so-called Twitter of China was featured in the [March 24, 2016, IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/two-factors-driving-explosive-growth-for-the-twitter-of-china/) and broke out two weeks later to launch a 191% gain in just the next six months.


After consolidating those gains, the company is now near a new buy zone as it gets ready to release Q1 numbers on May 16. Alibaba (May 18) and Tencent (mid-to-late May) are also set to report soon. ([JD.com reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-earnings/) before the open Monday, topping estimates. The stock gapped up to close nearly 8% higher in heavy volume.)


Weibo made IBD's list of [potential breakout stocks expecting 50% EPS growth](https://www.investors.com/research/q1-earnings-preview-potential-breakout-stocks-expecting-50-plus-growth/), with analysts looking for a 200% gain.


The company has already posted average earnings-per-share growth of 162% over the last three quarters, and a three-year growth rate of 521%.


Leading Stock In Leading Group
------------------------------


Weibo was spun off from Chinese internet portal **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) and went public in April 2014. Sina retains a majority stake in the company, and Alibaba holds a 31.5% share.


Within the internet content industry group, Weibo, **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) each earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. The group ranks No. 15 out of 197 groups, up from No. 18 last week.


Second Is The Charm?
--------------------


Weibo broke out of a double-bottom base in February, but quickly retreated to begin forming its current cup with handle as part of a base-on-base pattern. The entry is 57.57. Volume on down days in the handle has been light and the stock has found support at its 10-day moving average.



Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and at least three quarters of rising fund ownership.


On Friday, Weibo rose nearly 2% in below average, but rising volume, leaving it about 2% below the entry ahead of Tuesday's earnings.


While another 191% gain may not be in the works, see if Weibo can report another strong quarter and clear the buy point in heavy volume to launch a new run.


**Update:** On Monday, Weibo rose nearly 5% to close in the upper range of a 57.57 - 60.45 buy zone. Volume came in 199% above average and the relative strength line closed just below new high ground.

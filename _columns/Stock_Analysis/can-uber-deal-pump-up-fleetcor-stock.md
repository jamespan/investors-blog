The next time you're in an Uber car, your driver may be using a fuel card from **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) to fill up the tank. And that new partnership with the popular ride-sharing service and other new initiatives could help pump up FleetCor's stock.

  

The Georgia-based company provides fuel cards and specialty payment services for government and commercial fleet operators and oil giants such as **Royal Dutch Shell** ([RDSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDSA)),**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) .

  

The [new partnership with Uber Technologies](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/081115-766075-fleetcor-technologies-raises-guidance-partners-uber.htm), announced in June, will offer Uber drivers discounts on gas and allow Uber to deduct fuel purchases from weekly earnings automatically.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Although top- and bottom-line growth slowed in Q2, FleetCor beat estimates for both sales and earnings, with a boost from high-growth businesses and new oil partners abroad.

  

FleetCor also raised its guidance.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 21%, followed by a 17% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

With a 22% return on equity and 31% annual EPS growth rate, FleetCor earns a solid 98 Composite Rating.

  

You can see demand for the stock in its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After making a [strong and steady run](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/724818-can-slim-case-study-fleetcor-technologies-flt.aspx) beginning in August 2012, FleetCor took a bumpier turn beginning in Dec. 2013.

  

It [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) last October when a new low undercut the low in the prior consolidation.

  

The stock is now working on an early-stage double bottom with a 163.35 buy point.

  

FleetCor temporarily cleared the entry on August 6 after reporting earnings but closed the day below it.

  

Volume came in 277% higher than normal and stayed above average for several days as the stock continued to edge higher.

  

On Tuesday, the stock again cleared the buy point, only to slip back below it by the market close.

  

See if FleetCor can punch decisively through that entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

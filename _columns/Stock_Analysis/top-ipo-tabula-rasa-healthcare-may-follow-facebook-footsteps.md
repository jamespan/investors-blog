While last year's big-buzz IPO from **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) flopped in a way that was reminiscent of the **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) debut in 2012, the lesser-followed initial public offering of **Tabula Rasa HealthCare** ([TRHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRHC)) in 2016 has delivered healthy profits for investors.









 
 
 But [as is the case with many new IPOs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/), it took time – and a couple of bases – before Tabula Rasa found its market legs and began to climb.
If you look at the weekly charts for Facebook and Snap following their market debuts, you can see how both stocks initially headed south.


It took about 14 months for Facebook to launch a successful breakout and the social media giant has risen over 500% since then.

Time will tell if Snap can follow Facebook's path and start to climb higher, but Tabula Rasa has already proven its strength, gaining 131% from a breakout last August before pulling back in December.


Triple-Digit Earnings Growth
----------------------------


Tabula Rasa HealthCare provides proprietary technology to help the medical industry "optimize medication regimens to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs and manage risk."


So-called adverse drug events (ADEs), such as unintended overdoses, often occur due to multi-drug interactions, impaired renal function and other factors. Tabula Rasa's technology helps reduce that risk by providing doctors with real-time information on the medication's effectiveness and safety for a particular patient.


The New Jersey-based company's approach has proven to be a prescription for profits, generating average EPS growth of 322% over the last three quarters. Revenue gains have ranged from 25% to 63% over the last eight reports, including a jump from 32% to 38% in Q3.


Tabula Rasa is expected to report fourth-quarter numbers in March, with analysts looking for a 60% gain in earnings for the quarter and a 127% increase for all of 2017.


Tabula Rasa would have made the latest list of [stocks expecting 50%-plus growth in Q4](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/q4-earnings-preview-which-stocks-expect-50-or-greater-growth/), but its 91 Composite Rating fell short of the 95 minimum benchmark.


The company sports a solid 20.6% return on equity, but a lackluster pretax profit margin of 5.2%.


Institutional demand for Tabula Rasa is reflected in its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and five quarters of rising fund ownership.


Eight mutual funds with an A+ rating have a position in the stock, including Wasatch Micro Cap ([WMICX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMICX)).


Keep in mind that the stock is thinly traded, with an average daily volume of around 230,000 shares.


Bouncing Back To New Breakout?
------------------------------


Like Facebook and Snap, Tabula Rasa HealthCare struggled in the first several months following its September 2016 IPO. The breakout from its first base failed, but the second one turned out to be the charm.


The stock cleared a 15.93 buy point in August, launching a 131% rise in just over three months before pulling back sharply in December.



Tabula Rasa recaptured its 10-week line at the beginning of the new year and has been edging higher since then while building the right side of its current second-stage base.


After a 12% gain on Jan. 4, the stock eased back and found support right along its 10-day moving average. Note how that short-term benchmark has recently moved back above the longer-term 50-day line – a sign of renewed technical strength.


The stock came into the week trading well below its 36.90 buy point, then posted a 6% gain on Tuesday in strong volume. On Wednesday morning, Tabula Rasa bolted higher to clear the entry, but then reversed sharply to end the day with a small loss.


Such action on the day of a breakout attempt is a warning sign, although it did somewhat reflect the volatile action seen in the major indexes during today's session.


See if Tabula Rasa can bounce back into the buy zone in strong volume. If it does continue to head lower, be sure to [follow defensive sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) and cut any losses short.


Facebook was down 1% Wednesday, but remains extended from an earlier buy point. The social media giant is scheduled to report earnings on Jan. 31.


Snap managed to close higher for the sixth consecutive day and is now back above its 50-day moving average. The Snapchat parent reports Feb. 6.

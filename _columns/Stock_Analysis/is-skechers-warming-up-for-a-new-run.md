Today we'll look at California-based footwear maker, **Skechers USA** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)). After stumbling a couple of years ago on the sharp rise and fall of its Shape-ups toning shoes, the company has bounced back, with better inventory control and a continually updated product line covering everything from slip-ons and sneakers to high-performance running shoes.

  

Sales through Sketchers own stores account for a little under 25% of total revenue, while domestic and international wholesale generates approximately 75%.

  

The company has been innovating with memory foam, and a new GOmat insole is expected next spring. It mixes memory foam with gel for cushion and "rebound support."

  

Skechers has also been actively protecting those innovations, and recently filed lawsuits against Fila USA and Adidas AG's Reebok International, claiming they've infringed on Skechers' GOwalk product line.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After posting losses and negative sales growth in 2011 and part of 2012, Sketchers has bounced back with seven quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. Three of those gains came on comparisons to prior-year quarters that had negative or no earnings growth.

  

Revenue growth also improved during that time, including a jump from 14% to 21% last quarter.

  

Skechers is scheduled to release Q2 numbers on Jul. 21.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 85%, followed by a 24% gain in 2015.

  

The company's 7% return on equity is below the 17% minimum you'd prefer to see, and the 92 Composite Rating is a little under the 95 or higher score you typically look for.

  

But that's the nature of a turnaround story, so all eyes will be on the upcoming Q2 earnings report to see if the company can sustain its recent rebound.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a nearly two-year decline, Skechers' stock began to rebound in 2012 as profits and revenue gains returned.

  

It formed an awkward first-stage consolidation at the beginning of this year, and after breaking out, traded essentially sideways.

  

It then bolted higher on strong first-quarter earnings. Weekly volume was 249% above average â€” a clear sign institutional investors were scooping up shares.

  

Since then, the stock has been trading in a more orderly and controlled fashion, and recently found support at its 10-week moving average line.

  

Skechers is currently working on a second-stage flat base with an ideal buy point of 47.63, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

See if it can break past that price on volume at least 40% - 50% higher than normal.

  

But keep in mind that the current outlook is "uptrend under pressure," which means it's unclear if the overall market will shake off recent selling pressure or slip into a correction. Also, Skechers reports second quarter earnings on Jul. 21 and, depending on the numbers, that could swing the stock either up or down.

  

**Stock Checkup**

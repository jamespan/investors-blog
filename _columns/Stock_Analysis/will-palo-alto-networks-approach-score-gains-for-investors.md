Hackers have been busy lately.

  

For example in Feb. **Burger King's** ([BKW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKW)) Twitter account was reportedly hacked to look like **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)). And the hacker Tweeted that Burger King had been sold to McDonald's and the account had been taken over by Burger King employees.

  

With attacks like this on the rise, demand has been growing for better security for computer networks. And that's where **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) comes in.

  

The company, which was profiled in an April 5 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/040413-650517-palo-alto-networks-gets-jump-on-rivals.htm), has set itself apart from its rivals because it's pioneered the next generation of firewall technology.

  

A firewall serves as a barrier between a company's internal network and the Internet.

  

And Palo Alto's next-generation platform allows companies to secure their networks and safely enable the increasingly complex and fast-growing number of applications running on their networks.

  

Traditional firewalls focus security on the network ports and the traffic. Palo Alto's focuses their security on the applications and users.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• And Palo Alto's approach has caught on. They scored triple-digit sales growth gains in 2011 and early 2012. Since then growth has cooled but ranged from 50% to 88% the past three quarters, which is still strong.

  

• Earnings growth has been up and down. The company logged some losses in 2011 and 2012. But earnings were up 400% last quarter.

  

• And analysts predict earnings will climb 600% in the 2013 fiscal year which ends in July, then rise 110% in fiscal 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

But those past losses have weighed on its EPS Rating, which [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-palo-alto-networks-panw.aspx) shows is only 36.

  

And they've been a drag on the Composite Rating which measures a stock's fundamentals and technical action. Palo's Composite Rating is the No. 15 among the 22 stocks in its industry group.

  

**Zix**  ([ZIXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIXI)) has the group's highest Composite Rating. But Zix's sales growth track record hasn't been as strong as Palo's. And its earnings growth is expected to be flat this year.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart above, Palo came public last July, climbed until Sept. then fell into a long base.

  

Watch to see if the stock can climb the right side of that pattern and break out.

  

It's still too soon to tell what type of base it will become. But it may be one to keep on your watch list.

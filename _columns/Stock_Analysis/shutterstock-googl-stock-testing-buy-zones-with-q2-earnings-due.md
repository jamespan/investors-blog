**Shutterstock** ([SSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSTK)) has teamed up with **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) to unlock access to high-quality images across Google Drive. The partnership with the [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) giant has SSTK stock looking to spread its wings and take flight past a 104.42 buy point with earnings due next week.


Early Friday, Shutterstock popped past that entry early in the session. After easing back a bit, the stock managed to close above the buy point.Â [GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) also jumped on Friday, gapping up to 3.6% gain, making it extended from its recent buy zone.


Both Shutterstock and Alphabet are set to report quarterly earnings Tuesday.




In April, [Shutterstock announced an integration with Google Drive for Enterprise](https://investor.shutterstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/shutterstock-integrates-google-drivetm-enterprise-unlocking). The partnership enables Shutterstock's enterprise customers to automatically sync previously licensed and newly licensed Shutterstock creative images directly with Google Drive for Enterprise.


These images can be easily accessed across Google Workspace collaboration tools, such as Gmail, Google Docs, Google Slides and Google Sites. The integration with Google Drive allows marketers, designers, public relations firms, and others to simply search and insert Shutterstock content without leaving the Google business suite.


Working with a community of over 1.7 million contributors, Shutterstock adds hundreds of thousands of images each week. It currently has more than 370 million images and more than 21 million video clips available.

Top Investors Snap Up Shares In Shutterstock And GOOGL Stock
------------------------------------------------------------


Alphabet led the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/googl-stock-nvidia-lead-latest-list-of-new-buys-by-the-best-mutual-funds/). While much smaller than the search and cloud giant, Shutterstock photo-bombed its way onto the list as 34 funds with an A or better rating from IBD took a position in SSTK stock.


Shutterstock sports a 2.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/), more than double the 1.0 that indicates an equal amount of buying and selling.


Having three quarters of triple-digit earnings growth helps drive [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-i-in-can-slim-make-sure-top-fund-managers-are-backing-your-stock-picks/) for Shutterstock. And it has five quarters of improving EPS growth and a jump from a 56% slowdown in earnings in Q4 2019 to a 277% spike in Q1 of this year.


But analysts now see a return to more tepid growth, with estimates calling for just a 10% EPS increase for the second quarter.


Analysts expect Alphabet to maintain its earnings momentum and post a fourth straight quarter of acceleration, estimating a 125% jump for Q2.


Shutterstock Flashes Breakout Ahead Of Q2 Earnings
--------------------------------------------------


On Thursday, SSTK stock rose over 2% to close just shy of a 104.42 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Volume was below average for the day but already above average for the week.


On Friday, Shutterstock jumped past the buy point. Although it eased back later in the session, it ended above the entry with a weekly gain of nearly 5%. Volume for the day was 91% above average and 49% higher than normal for the week.


Back in May, Shutterstock [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in its prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/). So the current formation is a first-stage base.


While forming the current cup with handle, Shutterstock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) pulled back but is now back near a new high. SSTK stock also recently found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


With Shutterstock and GOOGL stock set to report soon, both stocks are now hitting new all-time highs.

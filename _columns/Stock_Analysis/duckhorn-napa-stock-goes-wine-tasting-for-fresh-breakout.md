Leading Fund Managers Take A Sip Of Duckhorn
--------------------------------------------


Having only made its stock market debut in March, Duckhorn is still in the fermentation stage in terms of establishing a track record of sales and earnings growth as a publicly traded company.


While still private, Duckhorn had mixed earnings growth that included several quarters of triple-digit EPS increases. In its first report as a public company on June 7, Duckhorn posted a 20% slowdown in earnings, but a 32% spike in revenue.


For its current fiscal year, analysts expect Duckhorn to post 79% EPS growth.


In a sign of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/), NAPA stock sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/). And 21 funds with an A rating from IBD hold NAPA shares. Plus, the number of funds that hold Duckhorn shares jumped from 30 to 100 in its first reported quarter as a public company.


NAPA Stock Set To Uncork New Breakout
-------------------------------------


Duckhorn has quickly established itself as one of the top IPOs to watch.


Right after going public, it began forming its first [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/). NAPA stock broke out of that base on June 8, as the stock soared over 16% after the company reported earnings.


Duckhorn then pulled back, eventually falling below the initial [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But NAPA stock found its footing, building a new [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 24.06 entry. Along the way, the stock also retook its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) in heavy volume during the week ended July 23.


After falling while basing, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has rebounded and is now trying to keep rising.


Duckhorn briefly cleared the 24.06 buy point Wednesday before slipping back below it. NAPA stock bounced off the day's lows to gain over 3%, closing at 23.90, just shy of the prior entry. The stock dropped Thursday and again Friday, but coming off its lows up 4% for the week.


See if Duckhorn can take a another sip of the buy zone, which extends to 25.26.

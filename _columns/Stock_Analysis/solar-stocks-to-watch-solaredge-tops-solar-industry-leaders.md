Not all solar stocks shine as brightly as **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)). The maker of solar power harvesting systems earns the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), meaning it's outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/).




Starting with an 80 Composite Rating for **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), fellow solar stocks **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) (an 79 Composite), **JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) (73), and **Canadian Solar** ([CSIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSIQ)) (63) all have Composite scores that significantly trail SolarEdge.


The solar energy industry group as a whole [ranks No. 81](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-24-2019/) from the top among the [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


Stocks often move in groups, and you're seeing that in solar stocks as well. SolarEdge, Daqo New Energy, Canadian Solar, and Enphase Energy are all showing somewhat similar cup-shaped formations as they show varying signs of a technical rebound.

SolarEdge Gets Energized
------------------------


Since its founding in 2006, SolarEdge has been innovating new ways to collect and manage solar energy in [photovoltaic (PV) systems](https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se-fact-sheet-na.pdf). Today, it's a leading engineering firm focused on smart energy technology. The Israeli company has solar systems installed in over 130 countries across five continents.


SolarEdge had its IPO in 2015, and has expanded its offerings to now include residential, commercial, and large-scale PV infrastructure. The company is also involved in energy storage, electric vehicle (EV) charging, home energy management and virtual power plants.


The company has a track record of solid sales and earnings growth. Revenue has grown 41% per year on average over the last three years, while earnings have risen at an average annual pace of 31% during the same period.


The solar energy leader sports an 18.6% pretax profit margin and a 32.8% return on equity.


SolarEdge Stock Powers Up New Breakout Attempt
----------------------------------------------


After running out of juice in May 2018, SolarEdge has recharged its batteries to power a new run. The stock has soared 113% since rebounding to break out from a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) at 45.42 in April. That cup formed within a much deeper base.


SolarEdge stock is now forming a [later-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) showing a 96.79 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Yet one could also argue that the huge decline throughout 2018 to early 2019 served to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trying to hit a new 52-week high, while the stock trades just below a new all-time high. Volume has been on the rise as SolarEdge makes that move.


In healthy signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), SolarEdge sports a solid B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


SolarEdge ended Friday's session at 94.26, leaving it 3% below the buy point.

 As **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and others rev up self-driving cars, lesser-known IBD 50-stock **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) is providing the "eyes" and cybersecurity needed for autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles to arrive safely at their destinations.
Given its recent chart action, Synopsys may also help investors spot and secure a new profit-making opportunity.


Internet Of Things Leader
-------------------------


While the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has given us connected cars, smart homes and mobile banking, it also invites increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyberattacks.


As a global leader in electronic design automation (EDA) and semiconductor IP (Intellectual Property), Synopsys works with technology companies to make sure their chip designs, apps and other offerings are secure, stable and compliant with relevant regulations.


As the world's fifteenth largest software firm, with over 11,000 employees and more than $2.4 billion in annual revenue, the Silicon Valley-based firm works in a wide range of industries, including automotive, energy, gaming, retail, financial services and health care.


Last year, Synopsys launched the DesignWare EV6x family of next-generation embedded vision processors. Among other applications, the processors help empower the eyes self-driving cars need to navigate the road.


In February, Synopsys announced a $100 million stock repurchase program, a sign management is confident and optimistic about the future.


Mixed Messages
--------------


A quick diagnosis of Synopsys in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-synopsys-inc-snps.aspx) reveals a mix of pass, neutral and fail ratings. 


Its three-year annual growth rates for earnings (10%) and sales (8%) don't earn a passing score, but Synopsys posted accelerating growth in both the top and bottom lines for fiscal 2017 Q1, ended Jan. 31. 


Sales jumped from 8% to 15%, while EPS gains spiked from 15% to 38%. 


Synopsys' Up/Down Volume Ratio of 0.7 is below the 1.0 or higher benchmark you look for, but eight quarters of rising fund ownership and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating point to institutional demand. 


With a 97 Composite Rating, Synopsys earns the No. 2 spot in the No. 33-ranked Computer-Software Design industry group, behind **Mentor Graphics** ([MENT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MENT)) and ahead of **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)).


Ready To Spring Higher?
-----------------------


After reporting earnings, Synopsys gapped up on Feb. 16 to close over 6% higher in volume 215% above average. 


Since then, the stock has held those gains, trading in a tight range, even when the major indexes sold off last week.



Synopsys is now trading just below a 73.18 buy point. In a bullish sign of market leadership, the Relative Strength line was right around new high ground as of Thursday's close. 


See if the recent tight trading becomes a tightly-wound coil that springs Synopsys into the buy zone in heavy volume.

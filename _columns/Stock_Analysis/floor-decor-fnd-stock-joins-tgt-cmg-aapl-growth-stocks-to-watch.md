Tech stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) led the coronavirus rebound, but stocks to watch in the retail sector have also taken part. **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) is one such stock, joined by **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)).




Floor & Decor, Chipotle and Target all earned a spot on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), as have Apple stock and AMD. FND stock and AMD also joined the ranks of leading growth stocks on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Like many of the leading stocks to watch, Floor & Decor fell sharply as the pandemic spread in March. But the hardwood flooring and accessories retailer has sprung back, lifted by a rebound from a 62% EPS decline in Q2 to a 107% increase in Q3.


Sales growth has also accelerated, from an 11% drop in the second quarter to a 31% gain in Q3.


Floor & Decor Delivers Builds On Fundamental Rebound
----------------------------------------------------


Floor & Decor's strong resurgence last quarter has earned it top billing among retail stocks with a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). Fellow leaders in the industry group include **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), **Lumber Liquidators** ([LL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LL)) and **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)).


The Atlanta-based company, which operates 128 warehouse-format stores across 30 states, sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), tracking sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole. So the fundamentals are in good shape. But what about the chart action for FND stock?


Floor & Decor Stock: Lessons On How To Read Stock Charts
--------------------------------------------------------


Floor & Decor stock offers several key points on [how to read stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


Since jumping off the floor it hit back in March, FND stock has shown real-world examples of the concept of [support and resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). The stock moved right along its 10-week moving average for months, then pulled back and found support at that benchmark line in September.


Floor & Decor encountered resistance as it hit a new all-time high in mid-October. Like an aging floor, the stock gave in and retreated as it formed a new base. The stock showed indications of two classic [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) — double bottom and cup with handle.


When interpreting how to read stock charts and determine optimal [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), understanding support and resistance is crucial. A potential buy point is determined by the most recent area of resistance in the chart.


For Floor & Decor, that was its old high at 86.37. To determine the ideal buy point, we add 10 cents just to make sure the stock clears that price and doesn't just bump its head against that ceiling and fall back down.


On Dec. 8, FND stock cleared its 86.47 entry in volume 60% above average. It moved over 3%  higher Thursday and held the bulk of those gains Friday. It closed the week just within the upper end of its buy range, which is up to 5% above the initial buy point.

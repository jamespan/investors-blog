Today we're going to take another look at **Chipolte Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) to see how it's acting during the market correction.

  

We last visited it in [January](http://education.investors.com/daily-stock-analysis/010914-685759-will-chipotle-mexican-grill-serve-up-new-profits-.aspx). As some of you may recall, they operate a restaurant chain. And they use high-quality ingredients to assemble made-to-order burritos, tacos, salads and burrito bowls.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth accelerated the past two quarters, coming in most recently at 30%.

  

• Sales growth ranged from 18% to 21% the past three quarters.

  

• The company is slated to release its latest results April 17, so keep an eye out for those.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts see earnings climbing 24% in both 2014 and 2015.

  

• The company's Earnings Stability Factor is 9. That reading tells you how consistent a company's earnings have been in recent years. And the lower the reading, the better.

  

• The Up/Down Volume Ratio is a 1.1, indicating demand.

  

• Chipotle's Return in Equity is 23%, which tops the 17% minimum you like to see.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg.aspx) shows Chipotle's 98 Composite Rating is the highest in the Retail-Restaurants industry group.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 55 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On the daily chart on this page, you'll see that a few months ago the stock carved out a flat base. The 550.38 ideal buy point was calculated by adding 10 cents to the peak on the left side of the base.

  

Some stocks offer an alternative, lower buy point. And this was one of them, coming in the form of a three-weeks-tight pattern. The alternative buy point was 537.10.

  

Although the stock did manage to get above its alternative buy point. It found resistance around its more traditional flat base entry point. After a slight pullback, the stock plunged below its 50-day line.

  

However, Chipotle did manage to find the strength it needed after reporting fourth-quarter numbers. The stock broke out of its base again, climbing above both potential buy points.

  

Its recent fall has put it back around its original 550.38 flat base buy point, wiping out a majority of the gains made from its previous highs back in March. Also, keep in mind with the market in a correction, it's not a good time to be buying stocks.

  

For investors who bought in on the breakout, it's also important to remember to always cut your losses if a stock drops more than 7% to 8% below the price you bought it at.

  

Still, it may be worth keeping an eye on Chipotle to see if it can climb back above the 50-day moving average line or if it goes on to form a new base.

With 62% EPS growth, 37.2% annual profit margins, and 50.9% return on equity, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) certainly qualifies as one of the top stocks to watch. So do its [cloud-based peers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) in the enterprise software group, including **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


Paycom stock has now cleared its recent 280.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and remains within the buy zone, which extends to 294.05.


The [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) as a whole is showing strength in recent days. RingCentral has popped into the upper edge of its buy range, while ServiceNow is just shy of a new buy point. Paylocity and Salesforce have also cleared their recent entries and are now [extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).


The enterprise software stocks group ranks No. 38 among the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.


Paycom Stock Among Stocks To Watch On Premier Screens
-----------------------------------------------------


Paycom is a clear leader both within its industry and the overall market. Based in Oklahoma City, the company provides software solutions for managing a company's human capital.


The stock has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). These lists, particularly IBD's most stringent screen Sector Leaders, have a track record of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sp500-beating-lists-find-next-apple-amazon/).


ServiceNow, Paylocity and Salesforce are on the IBD 50. RingCentral, ServiceNow and Salesforce are also on the IBD Big Cap 20.


Boosted by its strong profit margins and ROE, Paycom continues to post strong earnings and sales growth. The company has generated average annual EPS growth of 62% over the last three years. Sales gains have averaged 31% during the same period.


[Institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-i-in-can-slim-make-sure-top-fund-managers-are-backing-your-stock-picks/) have certainly taken notice, as evidenced by an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and a stellar 3.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/). A reading above 1.0 indicates demand.


Paycom Stock Enters New Buy Zone
--------------------------------


After [resetting its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) in September by undercutting the low in its prior pattern, Paycom stock has formed a shallower and shorter [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Paycom is currently trading about 3% above the new buy point, still within buy range. The stock has now closed higher in nine out of the last 10 days.


As always, in addition to watching the individual stock's action, be sure to keep an eye on the [general market](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/). The indexes have been bullish recently, but that can change very quickly to force investors to take a more defensive stance.


Paycom stock ended Friday's session by reversing to close essentially flat, but still  up nearly 5% for the week.

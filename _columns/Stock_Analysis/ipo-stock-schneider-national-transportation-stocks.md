Boosted by a roster of clients that includes **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) and **Deere & Company** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), transportation and logistics firm and 2017 IPO stock **Schneider National** ([SNDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNDR)) is trying to deliver a new breakout.




Founded in 1935 when Al Schneider sold the family car to buy his first truck, Schneider National now moves over 9.3 million freight miles loaded per day, generating $4.4 billion in annual revenue.


The Green Bay, Wis.-based company went public in April of last year, becoming one of the [top IPOs of 2017](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/). As of Q1, 260 funds have reported a position in Schneider National, including 67 funds with an A- or higher rating.


An A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership further indicate institutional demand for shares.


Leading Transportation Stock With 80% Growth
--------------------------------------------


Schneider National's 89 Composite Rating earns it the No. 4 ranking among logistics and transportation stocks. **Expeditors International** ([EXPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPD)), **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) and **XPO Logistics** ([XPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPO)) hold the top 3 spots within the industry group.


Schneider National beat analyst estimates in Q1 with an 80% spike in earnings, marking three straight quarters of accelerating growth. Revenue gains have increased in each of the last two reports, coming in at 13% in the first quarter.


Analysts expect 59% EPS growth for Q2. Estimates for both 2018 and 2019 were recently revised higher.

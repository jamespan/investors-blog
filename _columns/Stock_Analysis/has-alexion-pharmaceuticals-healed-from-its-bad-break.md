Today we’ll check in on **Alexion Pharmaceuticals**  ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), which develops therapeutics to treat hematologic and neurologic diseases and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Its first commercial product, Soliris, comes with a hefty price tag of over $400,000 a year.  
   
**Key Fundamentals**

  

The company has a solid track record of strong and steady growth. Revenue gains have ranged from 35% to 67% over the last eight quarters, while earnings growth has come in between 38% and 135% during the same period.  


  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 69%, followed by a 13% gain in in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.   


  

Alexion sports a strong 29% return on equity and the highest possible score of 99 for its EPS, and Composite Ratings.   
Its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate institutional buying over the last 13 weeks.  
   
**Chart Analysis**

  

While the stock has made a huge advance in recent years, there have been some bumpy periods along the way.   


  

One was a long stretch from Oct. 2012 through Dec. 2013, when Alexion struggled to clear resistance around the $120 mark.   


  

The stock finally cleared that ceiling and made a nice climb in the first quarter of this year. But it sold off in early March, when Congress began questioning the high cost of pharmaceuticals.   


  

Alexion found its footing, then see-sawed back and forth right around its 10-week line for several months.   
In October, it cleared a 179.69 buy point after reporting Q3 numbers and raising guidance.   
It rose as much as 10%, and then formed a three-weeks tight pattern, which it failed to clear.   


  

So while it’s not currently in a traditional buying zone, with its strong fundamentals, Alexion may be one to keep an eye on to see if it forms a flat base or another potential entry point.

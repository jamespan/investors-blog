While **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) and **Dave & Buster’s Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) both offer wings, widescreen TVs and a wide array of beer and cocktails, the latter’s “eatertainment” business model – and stronger earnings growth – are garnering more interest among fund managers.


What’s giving Dave & Buster’s a winning edge? Games. With a motto of “Eat, Drink, Play, Watch,” the Dallas-based company offers customers a restaurant, sports bar and arcade all under one roof.


Revenue is almost evenly split between games and the restaurant side of the business, with the sale of food and beverages making up just under half (48.3%) of last year’s $747 million in revenue.


Dave & Buster’s is helping boost arcade revenue with the launch of apps featuring mobile versions of its in-store games. Customers play the games on their smartphone, then cash in the e-tickets they win at the restaurant for prizes.


The company has also introduced the Power Card, which eliminates the need for game tokens and has an added bonus: customers are spending more money in the arcade using the pre-paid Power Card, which they can easily refill at Charging Station kiosks or via a mobile app.


Growth Matters More Than Size
-----------------------------


While Buffalo Wild Wings has more than 1,080 restaurants, compared to just 81 locations for Dave & Buster’s, the latter generated a 51% gain in earnings last quarter, outpacing Buffalo Wild Wing’s 23% rise. Its three-year annual EPS growth rate of 95% also trumps B-Dubs’ 21% pace.


Dave & Buster’s posted a 6% gain in comparable-store sales growth last quarter, while Buffalo Wild Wings’ company-owned comps growth slipped to 1.9%.


When announcing earnings on March 29, Dave & Buster’s forecasted revenue of $967 million-$987 million for fiscal 2016, which ends next January, well above consensus estimates of $862.2 million.


Rebooting In Post-'Tilt' Base
-----------------------------


After its October 2014 IPO, Dave & Buster’s went on a tear, rising 132% from its first-week close until peaking in August 2015.

But since establishing a new low in February, the stock has moved higher, flashing a string of tight weekly closes along the way.


The 10-week moving average remains below the 40-week line, a sign of lingering technical weakness. See if 10-week can get back above its longer term cousin.


The 10-day line on the daily chart is another benchmark to watch. That shorter term line has moved back above the 10- and 40-week moving averages, and the stock has been finding support right along the line.


See if Dave & Buster’s can continue to climb higher and clear the 43.16 entry.

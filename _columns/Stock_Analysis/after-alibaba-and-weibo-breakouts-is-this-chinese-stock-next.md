 Chinese internet stocks **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) have already launched breakouts, and **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) may be ready to launch a move of its own.
The three companies share more than just a Chinese and online heritage.


Weibo was spun off from Sina, then went on to have its U.S. initial public offering in 2014. Before the IPO, Alibaba bought a stake in the so-called "Twitter of China" and later increased its stake to 31.5%.


Sina continues to hold a controlling interest in Weibo.


Fellow Chinese internet stocks **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) have also broken out recently.


158% EPS Growth
---------------


Sina's earnings have rebounded in recent quarters, averaging 158% growth over the last three reports.


The internet portal provider has posted three straight quarters of rising sales growth, with Q4 revenue up 22%.


Sina and Weibo are both scheduled to report Q1 earnings May 16. Alibaba (Thursday) and Baozun (May 22) also report soon.


Sina holds the No. 5 spot within the No. 9-ranked internet content group, with Autohome and Weibo coming in at No. 1 and No. 4, respectively.


Alibaba (No. 1) and Baozun (No. 4) are members of the No. 13-ranked internet retail group.


Clearing Resistance?
--------------------


After clearing two former points of resistance at 80.63 and 79.90, Sina's next test will be the 85.34 entry in its second-stage consolidation.



The relative strength line has been rising and closing in on new high ground as Sina shows signs of institutional buying in the right side of the pattern.


Demand for the stock is further confirmed by an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership.


On Friday, Sina ended fractionally lower in light volume, but closed the week up more than 7% in above-average and rising trade and at the top of the price range.


The stock is 2% shy of the breakout price.


Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports earnings, so see if Sina posts strong numbers and climbs into the 85.34 to 89.61 buy zone in heavy volume.

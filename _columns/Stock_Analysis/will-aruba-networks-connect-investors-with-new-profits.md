Today we'll look at **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)), a leader in enterprise wireless networking.

  

As the [Sep. 5 New America column](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/090514-716238-aruba-networks-growing-fast-as-wireless-vendor.htm) noted, Aruba provides Wi-Fi access points and the software to make them smart, fast and secure. And the continued rise in mobile devices has increased demand for such anytime, anywhere Internet access.

  

The Silicon Valley-based company has enabled Wi-Fi connectivity at Google and Microsoft offices, Starbucks coffee shops, and a wide range of hospitals, colleges and other venues.

  

Aruba says rival **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) has a 47.5% share of the wireless networking market, compared to Aruba's 15%. But analysts note that Aruba has been gaining market share in recent quarters.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

That turnaround is reflected in the company's last two reports.

  

Aruba's earnings growth has gone from negative territory to back-to-back gains of over 80%. Sales growth has also picked up, showing acceleration in each of the last four quarters.

  

For fiscal 2015, analysts expect EPS growth of 43%, followed by a 17% rise in fiscal 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Aruba sports a solid 22% return on equity and 44% three-year annual EPS growth rate, helping it earn an overall 98 Composite Rating.

  

Large investors have taken note of the company's turnaround, and Aruba's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a healthy A-, and its Up/Down Volume Ratio of 1.8 also indicates demand.

  

Plus, the number of funds that own the stock has started to rise again, including a nice jump last quarter from 387 to 397.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Aruba rose over 1,800% from a low in Nov. 2008 until it peaked in April 2011. It struggled from there, as earnings and sales growth slowed.

  

But with the fundamentals showing more strength recently, the chart action has also started to shore up.

  

In February, Aruba began working on a second-stage cup-with-handle.

  

The base is not without flaws. The stock spent much of the pattern below the 10-week line and there were several down weeks on heavy volume in the left side of the base.

  

But note the down week that ended Jul. 11. Although volume was heavy, the stock showed a positive reversal, bouncing back from an intra-week low to close just barely down and at the top of its price range. So that heavy-volume down week was actually a sign of support and accumulation.

  

From there, the stock began building the right side of the base.

  

On Wednesday, Aruba broke past the 22.59 ideal buy point on volume 154% higher than normal.

  

The buying range for a stock is up to 5% above the ideal buy point. For Aruba, that's from 22.59 to 23.72. As of early Thursday morning, Aruba was still trading within that range.

Telecom infrastructure leader **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) engineers a new buy point as a nascent uptrend tries to gain strength. The company is riding strong tailwinds for fiber deployments, driving 143% earnings growth in the latest quarter and an estimated 152% EPS surge for the full fiscal year.




Showing strong [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-track-institutional-demand-to-find-winners/), Dycom made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds.](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-huge-sums-in-24-stocks-including-vertex-lilly-enphase/) In addition, the infrastructure company sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) while 22 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares.


The telecom earns the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), topping the Telecom-Infrastructure group. The industry ranks a strong No. 9 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Bullish Infrastructure Outlook Drives Top And Bottom Lines
----------------------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Dycom provides engineering, construction, project management and other services to the telecom and utility industries. Their operations stretch across 49 states and over 39 operating companies.


In its [August investor presentation](https://ir.dycomind.com/static-files/a40fae0b-394a-401d-9367-6da3972d7917), Dycom highlighted how increasing consumer demand for bandwidth continues to drive fiber deployments.


It noted that FTTH (fiber-to-the-premises) installations with telecoms are poised to accelerate, projecting more than 40 million "passings" to fiber through 2025. If achieved, it will double the current installed base.


It is estimated that almost 60% of U.S. homes and businesses will have direct fiber connections by 2025, up from roughly 32% in 2020.


Dycom On Deck For Earnings
--------------------------


Dycom posted triple-digit EPS growth in fiscal Q2 2023, ended July 30. It is scheduled to report Q3 results on Nov. 2, when analysts expect the telecom infrastructure firm to deliver a 40% rise in earnings.


The company reported multiple quarters of sporadic and lackluster revenue growth and slowdowns. However, it has now posted two straight quarters of accelerating sales.


Q2 revenue rose to $972 million, marking a 23% gain over Q1. In addition, Q1 growth rose 20% vs. Q4 2022.


Dycom Stock Lays Wires For New Breakout
---------------------------------------


After jumping nearly 4%, Dycom closed the week right around a 120.55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a cup-shape base. Volume was below average.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has hit a new high ahead of a potential breakout, earning a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/).


DY stock broke out of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in July and climbed to a new high before retreating into its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/).


It found support at its 200-day moving average while building the cup now in formation, rising sharply and retaking its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/).


The [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) are looking to build on a new uptrend. Let's see if Dycom Industries can tap into the promising trends in the telecom infrastructure industry and lay the wiring for a continued climb.

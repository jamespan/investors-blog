Before the fundamental and technical rebound in department stores like **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)), **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) and **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) over the past year, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) had proved its strength as an **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN))-resistant retailer.




Although Amazon had taken market share in apparel and other categories from [retailers](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) like Macy's and Kohl's, it failed to smudge Ulta's numbers. While its sales growth has slowed over the last two quarters, the cosmetics and beauty products retailer has still posted steady revenue gains of 15% to 25% over the last eight reports.


By comparison, Macy's revenue gains have ranged from a 7% decline to a 4% rise during the same time frame. Kohl's revenue gains have come in between a 3% decline and a 9% increase across the last eight quarters.


Despite its already massive size ($56.6 billion in revenue in Q3), Amazon has delivered increases between 22% and 43% over the same period. In addition to its retail business, Amazon's numbers include sales from its industry-dominant [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Retail Stocks To Watch: No. 1 Specialty Retailer
------------------------------------------------


With its highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Ulta Beauty ties **PetIQ** ([PETQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETQ)) for the No. 1 ranking within the specialty retail industry group.


PetIQ, **National Vision** ([EYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EYE)) and **Hudson** ([HUD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUD)), which all earned a spot on a recent list of [top IPO stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch/), are also among the group leaders. The group ranks No. 38 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Ulta's direct competitor, **Sally Beauty** ([SBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBH)), earns the No. 6 spot with an 82 Composite Rating.


Analysts expect Ulta to post a 21% increase in earnings for its fiscal 2018 third quarter. The Illinois-based company is expected to report in December. Analysts expect 31% EPS growth for the full fiscal year and a 16% gain in fiscal 2019.


Retail Stocks To Watch: Looking Pretty?
---------------------------------------


Ulta Beauty is trying to put the finishing touches on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 290.40 buy point. Its relative strength line is just below a new 52-week high.


A 1.8 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership point to solid institutional demand for the stock.


On Friday, Ulta Beauty gained 3.3% to close at 281.95, just 3% below the entry.



Macy's, Nordstrom and Kohl's are also working on new chart patterns as we wait for a [new stock market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) to begin. Each stock was up solidly early Friday, but only Macy's managed to close in the upper half of the day's price range.


Amazon has fallen below both its 10-week and 40-week moving averages as it tries to find its footing and resume its impressive climb. It's currently testing support at its 40-week line.

During a stock market sell-off like we've seen so far this year, mutual fund managers look for companies they believe will weather the storm better than most. And one defensive stock that may fit that bill is tobacco titan **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)).


The maker of Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes added the Newport brand to its line-up last year after completing its $25 billion buyout of Lorillard.


That acquisition, plus a rise in prices for tobacco products, helped boost Q3 sales growth to 41%, while earnings rose 17%.


Reynolds is scheduled to report Q4 and full-year 2015 numbers on Feb. 8. Analysts expect last year's EPS to rise 17%, followed by a 16% gain in 2016.


The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based firm sports the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, earning it the top slot within No. 27-ranked tobacco industry group, ahead of **Altria** ([MO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MO)) and **Philip Morris International** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)).


**3 Signs Of Resilience**


Since breaking out in March 2014, Reynolds has risen around 75%, forming multiple bases along the way.


Although its current consolidation is technically considered part of a long, first-stage formation, investors should not ignore the fact that Reynolds has already made a significant move and may be due for a deeper pullback.


But at least so far, the stock has continued to display three key signs of resilience: a rising Relative Strength line hovering near new-high ground, support at the 10-week moving average and higher volume on up days in the right side of the base.


Such behavior points to institutional support and could mean fund managers are viewing Reynolds American as a safe haven, a defensive play in a rocky, uncertain market.


So let's see if the stock can hold its ground, complete its current base and clear the 49.66 entry in heavy volume.

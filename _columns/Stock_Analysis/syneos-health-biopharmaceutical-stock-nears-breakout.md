Top Funds Pick Up Shares In Syneos
----------------------------------


While Syneos did not join Charles River Lab on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-in-tech-stock-googl-stock-shopify-nvidia/), 119 funds with an A rating from IBD own shares in SYNH stock.

Syneos Explores New Buy Point
-----------------------------


After finding support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), Syneos moved just above a 92.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) earlier on Friday. Volume was well below average, and the stock eased back to end the session just below the entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has been moving essentially sideways recently but is now trending higher as the stock tries to successfully break out. Look for heavier trade to kick in to show conviction for the move.

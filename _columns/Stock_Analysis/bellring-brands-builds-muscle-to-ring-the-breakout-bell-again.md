BellRing Eyes Megatrends For Long Growth Runway
-----------------------------------------------


In its [2022 annual report](https://cdn.bellring.com/assets/pdf/BRBR-2022-Annual-Report.pdf), BellRing said it continues to see a long runway to expand, fueled by megatrends related to its business. Those include growing demand for convenient health foods and increased protein consumption as health-conscious consumers recognize its many benefits.


Earlier this month, [BellRing introduced new plant-based protein powder](https://bellring.com/news/premier-protein-introduces-new-plant-based-protein-powder). With its Premier Protein Plant Protein Powder, the company aims to build muscle in the vegan protein space.


BellRing Brands reported [fiscal Q1 2023 results](https://bellring.com/news/bellring-brands-reports-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-year-2023-raises-certain-fiscal-year-2023-outlook) on Feb. 6, posting a second quarter of accelerating growth in both sales and earnings. Sales rose 18% to $362.7 million. Earnings gained 27% to 33 cents a share.


Analysts expect the company to boost earnings 5% this fiscal year (ending in September) and 18% in fiscal 2024.


BellRing Brands Stock Building Muscle For Buy Zone
--------------------------------------------------


After weathering a slump from September 2021 to the beginning of this year, BellRing broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#flatbase) with a 27.49 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


The stock jumped out to more than a 16% gain before pulling back  in February to form another flat base. The new buy point is 32.03. While forming its current pattern, BellRing has found support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) jumping to a new 52-week high, BellRing Brands gapped up Thursday to just below its new buy point. It popped into buy zone to close out the week.


Look for BellRing Brands to fortify the new breakout and sprint to a new all-time high.

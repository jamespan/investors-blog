Cybersecurity Stocks To Watch In Highly Ranked Industry
-------------------------------------------------------


CyberArk, Palo Alto Networks, Qualys and Fortinet all sport the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, helping the software security industry rank No. 18 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Nice** ([NICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NICE)) rounds out the top 5 group leaders.


Based in Petach Tikva, Israel, with U.S. headquarters in Newton, Mass., CyberArk is a leading provider of privileged access security, a key layer of defense to protect an organization's vital data and infrastructure. The company, which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-cyberark-stock/), has over 4,200 customers worldwide, including 50% of the Fortune 500 and over 30% of the Global 2000.


CyberArk has posted five quarters of improving earnings growth, including a 92% spike in Q3. Revenue gains have ranged from 14% to 35% over the last eight reports. The company is set to report fourth-quarter numbers before the stock market open on Feb. 14.


Analysts have recently raised EPS estimates for both 2018 (52%) and 2019 (10%).


Reflecting solid institutional demand, CyberArk has posted four quarters of rising fund ownership, and 18 funds with an A+ rating own shares.


CyberArk Leads Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet In Race To New Breakout
-------------------------------------------------------------------


While Palo Alto Networks, Qualys and Fortinet are still in the earlier stages of setting up new consolidations, CyberArk has just jumped into a new 81.98 to 86.08 buy zone.


CyberArk briefly entered buy range Monday morning, slipped below it, and then bounced back above the entry in strong trade. The stock rose 5% in heavy volume to close at 84.13. In a sign of market leadership, the relative strength line is at a new 52-week high.


On Tuesday, CyberArk tried to add to those gains despite selling pressure on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. But the stock pulled back 0.7% to close at 83.53, still inside the buy zone. The stock moved higher in rising volume in the final hour of trading to come off the day's lows.

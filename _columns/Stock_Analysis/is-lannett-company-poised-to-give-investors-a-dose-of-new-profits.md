Today we'll look at **Lannett Company** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)). They make generic prescription pharmaceuticals to treat thyroid deficiencies, migraines, epilepsy and other ailments.

  

Sales of generics have generally been strong the last few years as cost-conscious consumers choose them over branded drugs.

  

Also of note, on June 2, Lannett was added to the S&P 600, which tracks smaller-cap stocks.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The rising popularity of generic drugs is reflected in Lannett's recent numbers.

  

Sales growth has accelerated in each of the last three quarters, hitting a triple-digit gain of 105% in Q1. Earnings growth has also been stellar, with strong triple-digit increases in each of the last eight quarters. For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 298%, followed by a 35% gain in 2015.

  

Lannett's 11% return on equity is below the 17% minimum you prefer to see, but overall it scores the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

After slipping to a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating in early April, the stock has bounced back to earn an A-. That means institutional investors have been scooping up shares in recent weeks.

  

And that's also reflected in the stock's 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

You can also see signs of institutional demand in the rising number of funds that own Lannett, which has gone from 138 to 236 over the last three quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In January of last year, the stock launched a huge price move that took it from around $5 a share to over $45 in just 14 months, with good support at the 10-week line along the way.

  

The party came to a temporary end in March of this year.

  

Two important things were in play at this time. First, there was rising selling pressure in the overall market.

  

Second, there was a sharp and sudden sell-off in biotech and pharmaceutical stocks, partly on news that Congress might give added scrutiny to how drug companies set prices for their products.

  

When an industry or sector runs into trouble, no stock is immune, and Lannett fell sharply below its 10-week line.

  

But it did find support above its second line of defense, the 40-week moving average.

  

From that bottom, it began building the right side of a new base, and is now working on its eighth consecutive up week.

  

The pattern is a third-stage cup, with an ideal buy point of 46.61, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

As you like to see, there have been signs of accumulation in the right side of the pattern, and the relative strength line is nearing new high ground.

  

On Thursday, Lannett poked its head above the 46.61 ideal buy point, but closed just below it. So see if it can break out more decisively on heavy volume, at least 40% to 50% higher than normal.

  

**Stock Checkup**

**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Paysign** ([PAYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYS)), **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)), and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) are among the top-rated payment processing stocks. But the No. 1 ranked stock within the industry is [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) stock **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)).




With a 98 [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), Global Payments is outpacing 98% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). The Atlanta-based company gets passing grades for both its pretax profit margin (31.9%) and its return on equity (21.2%), both from 2018.


While those are solid numbers, the ROE and profit margins for Mastercard (125.1% ROE, 55.7% profit margin) and for Visa (36% ROE, 65.1% margin) are even more remarkable.


Global Payments' story began in 1967 with the creation of the National Data Corporation. Today, it is a global leader in payment processing, handling transaction involving retail, health care, gaming, education and more.


The company has more than 24,000 employees and is a member of the S&P 500.


Is Global Payments Stock Set To Pay Off?
----------------------------------------


Global Payments is looking to clear a 176.05 buy point in a cup-type base. This comes after the stock tried, but failed, in September to process a successful new breakout from an earlier setup.


While forming those two bases, Global Payments slipped below its 10-week moving average, but has since retaken that benchmark line.


Signs of institutional demand for the stock are mixed. It has a C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a neutral 1.0 up/down volume ratio. But one the positive side, Global Payments has seen solid advances in institutional sponsorship, with three quarters of rising fund ownership.


In terms of its payment processing peers, like Global Payments, Mastercard and Visa are also trying to set up new advances.

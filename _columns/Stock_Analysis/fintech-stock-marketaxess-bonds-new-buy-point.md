Fintech leader **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)) operates an institutional electronic trading platform with a focus on fixed income bond investing. After launching a new trading marketplace earlier this month, MKTX stock is now trying to bond with a new buy point.




On Dec. 9, MarketAxess announced the debut of a [centralized fixed income trading marketplace](https://investor.marketaxess.com/news-releases/news-release-details/marketaxess-launches-centralized-fixed-income-trading). The new platform fully integrates rates trading capabilities within the MarketAxess trading system.


Boosted by a strong Earnings Stability Rating, MKTX stock has earned a spot on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


As one of the top fintech stocks to watch, MarketAxess has made a [remarkable run since hitting a bottom in the financial crash](https://investors.com/news/management/marketaxess-ceo-whose-company-outperform-netflix-amazon-stock/) in November 2008. From that low through the end of November 2020, the stock has soared over 14,500%, establishing itself, along with names like **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), among the best growth stocks for more than a decade.


Top Funds Share Strong Bond With MarketAxess
--------------------------------------------


Several factors drive growth stocks to such heights, not least of which is strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) by the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-stocks-to-watch-amzn-amd-tsm-etsy/).


Five leading funds on the [IBD Mutual Fund Index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibd-mutual-fund-index-can-signal-when-its-a-stock-pickers-market/) have a position in MKTX stock, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX). Plus, 156 funds with an A+ rating from IBD hold positions in the stock.


MarketAxess registers an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole. Looking at the individual components of the rating, the fintech industry leader also scores strong [SmartSelect Ratings](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) for its ROE (50.35) and annual pretax profit margin (29.7%).


The future continues to look bright for MarketAxess. With average quarterly earnings growth of 46% over the last three reports behind it, analysts expect the New York-based company to deliver a 39% increase in Q4.


Consensus estimates call for a 44% EPS increase for the full year and a 9% gain in 2021. Estimates for both years have recently been revised higher.


Fintech Breakouts To Watch
--------------------------


Although MarketAxess has seen its share of [stock market volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/) over the past 12 months, the stock is setting up a new potential breakout.


MarketAxess has found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) as it tries to close in on a 606.55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). In a sign of renewing strength, the [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) is retaking the longer-term 50-day moving average.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has come off its highs, but is trying to rebound. Look for the RS line to near a new 52-week high as MarketAxess tries to hold support and launch a fresh breakout.


MarketAxess pulled back just under 3% Wednesday, but volume was light. In Thursday's shortened session, it managed to come off its lows to close fractionally higher.


On the weekly stock chart, note how volume in December has been above average as the stock completes its [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) and takes aim at a new buy zone. Such action shows continued demand among mutual funds and other institutional investors.

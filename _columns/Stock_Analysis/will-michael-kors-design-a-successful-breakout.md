The firm has a presence in over 85 countries, with more than 231 North American stores, and over 73 international locations.

**Chart Analysis**

  

Looking at the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, you can see where the stock broke out of a second-stage flat base in February of this year, after reporting good fourth-quarter numbers.

  

Prior to that earnings report, the stock met resistance at its 50-day line and fell sharply below it just ahead of earnings. Volume that day was 153% above average.

  

But Kors quickly turned that loss into a big gain the following day, as it gapped up after posting accelerating top- and bottom-line growth. Note the huge volume, 499% higher than normal for the day.

  

From there the stock continued to move higher, pausing briefly at its 10-day line before climbing to a new 52-week high of 101.04.

  

For a while, Kors was able to hold on to the bulk of its gains as it traded in tight fashion.

  

However, as the overall market weakened and a correction took hold, Kors pulled back to, then fell below, its 50-day moving average line.

  

In early April, it posted four consecutive down days as it dropped below that benchmark. And note how volume was rising as that happened, which is the opposite of what you want to see.

  

Since then, the stock has struggled to get back above the 50-day.

  

The current pattern has yet to take a definitive shape, but one possible entry point could end up being 101.14, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

Michael Kors is scheduled to post earnings on May 28, so watch to see if it can score another quarter of accelerating sales and earnings growth.

**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) is among the handful of stocks that kept its head up during the recent market sell-off. Now with the market's modest rally, it's showing real strength.




The Edwards stock chart shows why some investors were fooled by its initial [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) on July 23 from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base, when it rose just 0.75% on lower-than average volume to push through the 195 buy point. Some breakout.


Those who didn't nibble on Edwards stock no doubt were surprised the following day, when Edwards stock [gapped up](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) 9.9%, well beyond the 5% [buy zone](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/).


Since that bullish breakout (on a good earnings report), the stock has performed well in a testy overall stock market. It has remained even or risen as other stocks lost ground. On Thursday, Edwards stock made a sweet 3.5% move on an 87% rise in volume. With the market's advance on Friday after September's jobs report, Edwards stock surged to a new all-time high.


Edwards Stock: Have Sellers Disappeared?
----------------------------------------


That phrase "new all-time high" is key. In essence, it means no one owns the stock who bought it at a higher price. So there's no [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) of sellers as the stock goes up — only profit takers.


That might help explain why Edwards stock in recent weeks tap-danced off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) twice, each time coming through with a powerful upward move. With the most recent move, the [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) line also hit a new high, confirming Edwards' stock gains. The stock is in buy range from the support at the 50-day line. It helps that it has a 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), and a 93 [EPS Rating](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). And it's No. 1 in its industry group.


An interesting side note: From the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter, fully 12% of all Edwards stock fund investors cashed out entirely, with their number declining from 1,943 to 1,705, a drop of 238 funds. Since Edwards stock is 44% owned by funds, that was a lot of selling. Yet its share price barely budged, correcting once in a run-of-the-mill 16%-deep cup with handle.

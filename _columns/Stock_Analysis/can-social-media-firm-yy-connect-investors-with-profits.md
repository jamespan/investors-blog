Today we're going to look at **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), which was featured in a July 8 [New America Analysis article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/070513-662626-yy-online-social-platform-drives-strong-sales.htm).

  

It's based on China and runs an online social platform that lets users engage in group activities through voice, text and video.

  

People can play games, watch shows and concerts, sing karaoke songs and chat with other users.

  

Most of YY's revenue comes from online games and music, though it also gets money from online advertising and other sources.

  

Analysts say that the fragmented and highly regulated media environment combined with a highly developed consumer technology, means the Internet has a larger share of the media consumption time in China than it does elsewhere.

  

In fact, the Internet's share of media consumption is 47% in China compared to around 25% in the U.S.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

So let's take a look at its fundamentals.

  

• The company had some losses a few years ago, but earnings growth has been rebounding, coming in at 156% last quarter.

  

• It's had a long string of triple-digit sales growth gains.

  

• Going forward, analysts predict earnings will climb 63% this year and 65% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-yy-inc-ads-yy.aspx) shows YY is ranked No.7 among the 43 stocks in the Internet-Content industry group.

  

**BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) has the group's highest Composite Rating, but it's thinly traded and is forming a late-stage base.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 14 among IBD's 197 industry groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart above, YY came public last Nov., then formed two bases as it climbed higher.

  

Recently it paused and pulled back to the 50-day line where it found support. The ideal time to buy a pattern like that is as close to 50-day line as possible once the stock starts to rebound up from it on heavy volume.

  

However with the market in a correction, it's not a good time to be buying stocks because most growth stocks have a hard time swimming against the market tide.

  

So for now this may just be one to keep on your watch list.

Top Funds Buying Shares In Adobe, Other Software Stocks
-------------------------------------------------------


Adobe holds the No. 1 spot within the Computer Software-Desktop group, which ranks No. 36 among IBD's 197 industries. In a sign of institutional demand, Adobe made the latest list of new buys by the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-news-performance-reports-investing-ideas/), which will be published on Feb. 8. Twenty-three leading funds invested a total of approximately $412 million in Adobe stock over the last three months.


Several other software stocks, including Salesforce.com, ServiceNow, Palo Alto Networks, and Veeva Systems, also made the new buys list.


Based in San Jose, Calif., Adobe is a leading developer of data analytics software and creative programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and After Effects. Adobe also offers a full suite of cloud-based marketing and customer engagement solutions.


Revenue growth has been strong and steady, ranging from 22% to 27% over the last eight quarters. Earnings increases have come in between 40% and 65% over the same period.


In December, the company reported $9.03 billion in revenue for fiscal 2018, ended Nov. 30. Analyst earnings estimates for fiscal 2019 (15%) and 2020 (24%) were both recently revised higher.


Adobe Stock Resets Base Count After 150% Gain
---------------------------------------------


From a January 2017 breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), Adobe rose 150% until pulling back in September 2018. During that run, the stock found consistent [support along its 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


While forming its current consolidation, Adobe undercut the low in its prior chart pattern, making its new double bottom a first-stage base. First-stage consolidations have a higher likelihood of success than later-stage formations.


One yellow flag is that the 10-week moving average remains below its longer-term 40-week line. Look for that to reverse. But the relative strength line is just below a new 52-week high ahead of a potential breakout past a 260.82 buy point.


Note that the pattern can also be viewed as a double bottom with handle, which offered an earlier entry at 250.78. Adobe briefly cleared that buy point on Feb. 1, but closed the day below it. The stock retook the entry on Monday, but volume was 10% below average, far below the 40% or higher spike in trading you want to see on the day of a breakout.


On Tuesday, Adobe gave back most of its earlier gains, but managed to to eke out a 0.03% gain to close at 254.82, 2% below the buy point. Given that hesitation, look for heavy trading to kick in before investing on any new breakout attempt.

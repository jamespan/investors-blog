While **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are collectively known as the FANG stocks, these tech titans don't travel in the same herd when it comes to fundamental strength and chart action.









 
 
 Netflix launched a promising breakout on Oct. 5 in strong volume, but ran into resistance after [reporting Q3 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-beats-on-third-quarter-sales-misses-on-earnings/) on Oct. 16. The stock is still trading within the 190.05-199.55.
Alphabet has been testing a 1,006.29 buy point in a flat base that is part of a larger, first-stage base-on-base formation. The stock has tried to clear that entry in recent days in light volume, but closed the week below it. Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter numbers on Oct. 26, the same day as Amazon.


Facebook is currently trading right around a 175.59 entry in a second-stage flat base. Note that a breakout would also mark a new all-time high for the May 2012 IPO. Also keep in mind that Facebook is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 1. Facebook found support at its 10-day line and ended the week at 174.98.


While Amazon is dominating retail, leading in cloud computing and aggressively disrupting the grocery business and several other industries, it currently has the weakest fundamentals among the FANG stocks, thus earning it the lowest Composite Rating at 58.


But Amazon's stock has been rebounding as it tries to complete a late-stage base with a 1,083.41 entry. Amazon has climbed back above its 50-day line and the shorter-term 10-day moving average is now back above its longer-term cousin. But Amazon headed lower in the second half of the week and its share price has slipped back below the 1,000 benchmark. The stock is currently about 9% shy of the buy point.

Using [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to run an instant diagnosis of each stock, here's how Facebook stacks up against Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet in terms of [key stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Facebook arguably has the edge in terms of current technical and fundamental strength, but the battle to lead in artificial intelligence could prove to be the key factor that ends up driving longer term success or failure.


Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are making particularly strong pushes into AI, a revolutionary technology that could determine, to a large degree, who controls the platforms that distribute information and connect us to our smart devices, smart homes and smart cars.

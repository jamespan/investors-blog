If they remade the classic film "The Graduate" today, when Mr. McGuire tells Dustin Hoffman's character he has just one word for him, it wouldn't be "plastics." It would likely be the "cloud." And fast-growing 2016 tech new issue **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) is a [key player in the cloud computing space](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/how-this-ipo-could-impact-your-facebook-posts-binge-watching/).


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and countless others are putting increasing demands on high-speed cloud networking to power their mobile apps, video streaming and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. That bodes well for Acacia, which develops high-speed interconnect modules for cloud infrastructure operators and communication service providers.


Explosive Earnings & Sales Growth
---------------------------------


Acacia's Q1 sales growth of 79% earns it a spot among the four stocks on IBD's [Tech Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/tech-leaders/) with the [biggest year-over-year quarterly gains](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/tech-leaders/4-top-tech-stocks-with-biggest-sales-gains/), along with **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) (108%), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) (63%) and Facebook (52%).


The Massachusetts-based company also sports a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 237%. At the end of this month, it's expected to post its first earnings report since going public in May.


Acacia's 99 Composite Rating ranks No. 1 within the fiber optics industry group, and demand for its shares is reflected in its 2.1 up/down volume ratio.


IPO Base Breakout: Take Two
---------------------------


Acacia went public on May 13 at 23, then nearly doubled in price within five weeks.


The stock broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) with a 43.20 entry on June 16, but then sold off and fell back below the buy point as the Brexit vote rattled the market. Acacia has now established and is testing a new potential entry at 45.85.


While it's been a fairly volatile IPO in a seesaw market, as a leading player in a fast-growing industry, Acacia may be one to watch.

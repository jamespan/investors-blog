After making IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-light-up-on-lumentum-add-stamps-com/), high-performance suspension and shock absorber maker **Fox Factory** ([FOXF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXF)) jumped into a new buy zone Wednesday.









 
 
 It's positive to see fund managers with a proven track record of success buying into a stock, and from March to May, three leading funds scooped up approximately $10 million worth of Fox Factory shares.
Other leisure sector stocks that also made the list of new buys by top funds include **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Marriott Vacations Worldwide** ([VAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VAC)), **Malibu Boats** ([MBUU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBUU)), **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) and **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)).


No. 1 Ranked Stock
------------------


Boosted by a 119% spike in earnings growth in Q1 and a 28% return on equity, Fox Factory holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the leisure products industry group. **Marine Products** ([MPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPX)), Malibu Boats, **Johnson Outdoors** ([JOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOUT)) and **Brunswick** ([BC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BC)) round out the top five.


Fox Factory also posted an acceleration in sales growth in Q1, from 17% to 33%.


Institutional demand for the stock is further confirmed by an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 2.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio and eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership.


Still Within Buy Range
----------------------


On Wednesday, Fox Factory rose nearly 6% to bolt past a 34.10 entry from a flat base, which is part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. Volume was 160% above average, well beyond the 40% or higher spike you look for on a breakout.



The relative strength line also spiked into new high ground, a bullish sign as a stock launches a new move. Even as the Nasdaq fell on Thursday, Fox Factory's RS line continued to show resilience and remain right around new high territory.


Fox Factory ended Thursday down about 1%, but well off its earlier lows. Volume was above average, but much lighter than on Wednesday's big jump.


The stock rose over 1% on Friday, closing the week at the upper end of the buy zone, which extends to 35.81.

The market sell-off due to the coronavirus is taking its toll, even among some of the top stocks to watch. San Francisco-based 2019 IPO stock **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) is one example which has been trying to show resilience.


Cloudflare provides security and optimization software for [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) networks. While the company is not yet profitable, it is showing strong sales growth, ranging from 18% to 67% over the last eight quarters. Cloudflare has generated average annual revenue gains of 50% over the past three years.


Cloudflare's enterprise software group ranks No. 7 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) lead the industry.

Cloudflare Stock Sparks New Breakout
------------------------------------


As big-buzz [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/uber-ipo-lyft-facebook-alibaba-how-to-buy-ipo-stocks/) like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) have shown over the years, new initial public offerings can be volatile. That's especially true in a [stock market downtrend](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/).


Since going public in September, Cloudflare stock has seen its share of stock market volatility. But the cloud stock has also shown its share of support and resilience at [key moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


Cloudflare has managed to rise above its 10-week line, but is retreating and now testing its shorter-term 10-day moving average. On Wednesday, the stock jumped 9% to punch just through a 22.18 buy point, but fell just below that entry the next day.


As of early Friday, Cloudflare is holding support at its 10-day line, a sign that the IPO stock is trying to buck the overall stock market sell-off. Note that Cloudflare's relative strength line remains near new-high ground, a sign of leadership in a down market.


While it's risky to buy any stock in a market downtrend, Cloudflare's strong sales growth and technical resilience makes it one of the top stocks to watch as we wait for the general market to regain its footing.

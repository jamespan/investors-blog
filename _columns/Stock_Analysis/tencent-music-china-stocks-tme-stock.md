Heavily followed China stocks like **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) remain mired in multiyear slumps, while **PDD** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), parent of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rival Temu, has retreated after a breakout in May. Meanwhile, China-based **Tencent Music Entertainemt** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) is tuning up for a potential breakout with strong growth estimates ahead.


As the Nasdaq and bellwether [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) take hits after huge runs, Tencent Music stock is testing support at its 50-day moving average as it looks to build on the impressive run it's made over the last year.




Tencent Music Hits High Note On Growth Turnaround
-------------------------------------------------


Tencent Music Entertainment is the leading online music and audio entertainment platform in China. It offers fans a lineup of services that range from online music and online karaoke to music-centric livestreaming and online concerts. Tencent also operates popular music apps, including QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music and WeSing.


While shares of Alibaba and JD.com remain in a downward spiral, Tencent Music has rebounded as its rising earnings growth continues. Earnings have accelerated the last two quarters, including a 16% spike to 15 cents a share in its first-quarter report on May 13. Revenue dipped slightly in Q1 to $937.2 million.


Analysts expect both earnings and sales growth to pick up in upcoming quarters. Revenue is expected to get back above $1 billion in Q3 and Q4.


When Tencent Music reports second-quarter numbers on Aug. 13 before the open, Wall Street expects a 34% year-over-year jump to 15 cents a share. Analysts see gains of 49% and 45%, respectively, in Q3 and Q4.


For the full year, Wall Street expects earnings of 57 cents a share, followed by a 22% jump to 70 cents in 2025. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

Tencent Music Stock Rises As Funds Jump In
------------------------------------------


As Tencent Music returned to growth, TME stock also changed its tune, launching a big run that started in August. While making that run, Tencent has continued to find solid support at its sharply rising [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


As shown in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-tencent-music-ent-adr-tme.aspx), institutional investors have taken notice. Tencent Music has posted three straight quarters of rising fund ownership and earns a B- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/). It scores a 91 Composite Rating, meaning it currently outpaces 91% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/).


TME stock has now formed a third-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) showing a 15.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) weakened as the Chinese entertainment leader pulled back to form the new base after hitting a 52-week high in May. Look for the RS line to turn higher as the stock nears the buy point.


Plus, keep an eye on the general market. On Wednesday, IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) dropped from the highest-possible 80% to 100% to a still bullish 60% to 80%. The reduction came as the Nasdaq retreated to test the 18,000 mark and Nvidia sunk nearly 7% while **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), Microsoft and other leaders in this bull market took hits. Nvidia rebounded on Thursday but fell again Friday.

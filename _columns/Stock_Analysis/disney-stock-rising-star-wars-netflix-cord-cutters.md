Expectations for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" are of galactic proportions, with projections for over $2 billion in global box office sales. And that hype is already making history.


Fandango told [Variety](http://variety.com/2015/film/box-office/star-wars-the-force-awakens-budget-1201645026/) the movie from **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) set a new record, with over $50 million in pre-sales ahead of the Dec. 18 debut.


The latest installment of the Star Wars series is also expected to be more than just a box office bonanza. [Forbes reported](http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/just-how-much-will-the-new-star-wars-movie-make/) that Disney may reap an additional $5 billion revenue windfall in 2016 alone from branded toys, video games and other products.


But while Disney may win the war in a galaxy far, far away, it continues to do battle with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and other online video streaming players here on Earth.


Although the number of cable TV cord-cutters is rising, the House of Mouse has so far held its own. To compete with over-the-top (OTT) TV services, Disney established Hulu with **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **21st Century Fox** ([FOXA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXA)), and also makes its channels available on Sling TV, owned by **Dish Network** ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)).


In its latest earnings report, Disney's cable and broadcast segment logged a 12% gain in revenue, and CEO Robert Iger said he's "bullish" on ESPN.


**Key Numbers**


Earnings rose 35% and topped analyst estimates for fiscal 2015's fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 3. Sales rose 9% but came up just short of expectations.


Disney's 95 Composite Rating is No. 1 within the Media-Diversified industry group.


**Chart Analysis**


On Wednesday, Disney cleared a 117.68 buy point in a cup-with-handle.


While volume was below average on the breakout, the stock continued higher on Thursday and Friday. Disney closed the week still trading within the 117.68-123.56 buy zone.

Although Epam didn't make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](http://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-new-buys-adobe-abiomed-macys-kohls/), 59 funds with an A+ rating have reported a position in the stock. The stock's B+Â [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-is-key-in-a-base/) and 1.8 up/down volume ratio further point to strong institutional demand.


Since mutual funds provide the buying power to fuel a sustained upward climb, you want to focus on stocks they're heavily accumulating. Such institutional demand is one of the [seven most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).

No. 1 Ranked Tech Services Stock
--------------------------------


Founded in 1993, Epam leverages its digital engineering and design expertise to develop products and solutions for clients in a wide range of industries, including software, health care, financial services, energy, retail and manufacturing.


Last month, Epam's [InfoNgen](http://investors.epam.com/news-releases/news-release-details/epams-infongentm-debuts-highest-score-possible-seven-criteria-0) sentiment analysis tool was categorized by independent research firm Forrester as one of the top eight text analytics platforms using AI and machine learning. According to Epam's VP of Enterprise Products Jitin Agarwal, "by leveraging machine learning and intelligent search capabilities, InfoNgen enables clients to consolidate and analyze enterprise structured and unstructured data to ultimately make smarter, more agile decisions."


Revenue for the Pennsylvania-based company has ranged from 20% to 31% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has come in between 21% to 31% during the last three reports. Epam sports a solid 21.7% return on equity and 16.4% annual pretax profit margin.


Epam is set to report Q2 earnings before the market open on Aug. 2.


With a 98 Composite Rating, Epam shares the No. 1 ranking among tech services stocks with **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)).


AI Stocks To Watch
------------------


In addition to solid fundamentals and strong institutional demand, Epam's recent chart action makes it one of the top AI stocks to watch.


The stock is working on a second-stage base-on-base formation, and has consistently found support at its 10-week line. Within that pattern, Epam is working on a flat base showing a 131.85 entry. On Tuesday, Epam briefly cleared that buy point before retreating. The stock ended the day off just under 1% lower to close 2% below the entry.


On Wednesday, Epam bounced back from an earlier decline to close fractionally higher. The stock remains around 2% below the buy point. Epam's relative strength line is within striking distance of a new high.

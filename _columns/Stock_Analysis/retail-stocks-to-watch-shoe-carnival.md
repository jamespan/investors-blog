As the nascent stock market rally runs into headwinds, **Shoe Carnival** ([SCVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCVL)) has emerged as one of the top retail stocks to watch. Energized by 217% earnings growth in its most recently reported quarter, can it race past a new buy point?




Along with **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)), **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), Shoe Carnival is a leader among shoe and apparel [retail stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/). The industry group ranks No. 17 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks. That's up from No. 27 six weeks ago.


Among those leading retail stocks, those near potential buy points are Shoe Carnival, Burlington Stores and TJX — the parent of TJ Maxx and Home Goods.

Retail Stocks To Watch: Shoe Carnival Earnings Due
--------------------------------------------------


Shoe Carnival has posted six straight quarters of accelerating EPS growth. Earnings jumped from 73% to 217% in the company's August report for fiscal 2018 Q2. Analysts expect that streak to end when the Indiana-based retailer reports on Nov. 15. Consensus estimates call for a 10% decline in earnings for Q3.


But analyst estimates for the current and next fiscal year were recently revised higher to 45% and 10%, respectively.


After several quarters of low single-digit sales growth, Shoe Carnival posted a 14% spike in fiscal Q2.


Signs of institutional demand have been mixed. As is common when a stock is forming a [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), Shoe Carnival's Accumulation/Distribution Rating (B-) and up/down volume ratio (0.8) have slipped. But the stock has seen two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Among the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/warren-buffett-berkshire-walgreens-starbucks-best-mutual-funds-buys/), 113 with an A- or better rating own shares in the stock, including 12 with an A+ rating.


Shoe Carnival operates over 400 stores in 35 states and Puerto Rico, offering moderately priced footwear for men, women and children.


Retail Stocks To Watch: Can Shoe Carnival Clear This Hurdle?
------------------------------------------------------------


A new [stock market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) began with a follow-through day on Nov. 7. But as the market action since then may be showing, [not all follow-through days work](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-stocks-stock-market-follow-through/). Some will fail to lead to a sustained new uptrend, as the market quickly retreats. On Monday, the market outlook changed from "market in confirmed uptrend" to "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-news-dow-tumbles-600-points-apple-weighs/)."


Shoe Carnival has been trying to put up a brave face and buck the recent market selling pressure. Its relative strength line remains within striking distance of a new 52-week high as it builds the right side of a flat base.


Technically, it's considered a first-stage chart pattern since the stock undercut the low in a prior base in August. But as undercuts go, it was a mild retreat. So investors shouldn't ignore the nearly 200% move the stock made from a bottom in August 2017 through August of this year, when it pulled back to form its current consolidation.


See if the new stock market uptrend can regain its footing, and if Shoe Carnival can jump past its 45.10 buy point in heavy volume. But given the current market volatility, be sure to keep any new buys on a tight leash by following sound [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/).


On Tuesday, Shoe Carnival pulled back in heavy volume, ending the day down nearly 4% and below its 50-day moving average. See if it can [find support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and retake that key benchmark line.

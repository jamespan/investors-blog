With fourth-quarter earnings season underway, now is the time to build your list of the [best stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/), with a focus on companies like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), 2017 IPO **Gardner Denver** ([GDI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDI)) and leading Chinese stocks **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) that are expected to deliver earnings growth of 50% or higher.









 
 
 To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and meet the following benchmarks for their [IBD SmartSelect Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measure the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/):  

• 95 or better Composite Rating.  

• 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating.  

• 80 or greater EPS Rating.  

• B or higher Accumulation Rating.
Stocks Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q4 Earnings
-----------------------------------------


The stocks on this list are expected to report fourth-quarter earnings over the next several weeks. Take the reporting date into consideration when deciding whether or not to buy on a breakout, since purchasing a stock just ahead of earnings can be risky. Also note that several stocks on this list, including **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), are already extended after clearing recent buy points.


To build and update your  earnings season watch list, regularly check the [earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) to see which stocks are getting ready to report, and keep an eye on IBD's daily highlights of [stocks near a buy zone ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/tag/Stocks-Near-Buy-Zone-Ahead-Of-Earnings/).


Streaming giant Netflix edged past a 204.48 buy point on Jan. 3 and has now climbed above the buy range, with nice gains on Thursday and Friday.


After clearing a 184.35 buy point in a second-stage flat base to kick off the new year, [Facebook dropped sharply Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-set-to-undercut-buy-point-on-meaningful-news-feed-changes/) after the social media giant said it would change its News Feed feature to highlight posts from friends and family rather than those from publishers or brands. The stock was down over 4% on volume 352% above average, but it did manage to close right around its 50-day line. See if it can bounce back above that key benchmark next week.



Weibo is working on a later-stage consolidation with a 123.10 entry. The stock is currently trading just 1% below the buy point.


Fellow [leading Chinese stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) is building a double bottom with a 37.07 entry, and closed Friday's session at 36.87, so see if it can break out in strong volume next week.


After crashing below its 50-day line in October, China-based K-12 after-school tutoring firm **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) is building a late-stage consolidation and has just completed a handle to offer 34.30 buy point. Like Facebook, TAL took a hit Friday, moving down over 4% in heavy volume.


58.com, often referred to as the Craigslist of China, was [featured in the IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/alibaba-sets-up-as-58com-craigslist-of-china-posts-2550-growth/) just before it broke out from a third-stage consolidation. The stock ended the week still in buy range.


Chemical manufacturer **Kraton** ([KRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRA)) is also still in buy range from a 51.33 buy point in a third-stage flat base, although it did drop 2% Friday in below-average volume. The Houston-based company was just [profiled in The New America column](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/merger-helps-this-chemical-maker-discover-the-right-formula/).


**Allison Transmission** ([ALSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALSN)), which makes automatic transmissions and hybrid propulsion systems for medium and heavy duty vehicles, is working on a new base, a second-stage cup. The stock is currently 3% below the 45.79 entry.


[IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) is in buy range after clearing a 192.85 entry in a late-stage base.

Don't Miss A Beat
-----------------


The trick to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watch list and action plan. When a company delivers an earnings surprise and breaks out, you want to be there, ready to pounce.


But keep in mind that disappointing numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.


So use screens like the one here as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as we head into the Q4 earnings season.


Also be sure to [run all your stocks through a buying checklist](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IBD_BuyingChecklist.pdf) before you invest, use sound [sell rules](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) and [check overall market conditions](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/).

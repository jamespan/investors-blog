**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) broke out Thursday on news it will launch a mobile payment service to compete with PayPal, currently a unit of **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), as well as Apple Pay and Google Wallet. The social media giant, which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and virtual reality pioneer Oculus Rift, said its Messenger app will let users send money to friends by connecting a **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) or **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) debit card.

  

It will be a free service enabling payments via desktop and other devices, and should roll out in the U.S. over the next few months.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Facebook continues to show impressive top- and bottom-line growth. Fourth-quarter earnings growth jumped to 69%, while sales rose 49%. Analysts expect earnings to increase 12% this year, followed by a 32% gain in 2016.

  

Facebook earns a 94 Composite Rating, and its A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock has risen over 180% since breaking out of a double-bottom pattern in July 2013. During that run, Facebook was featured in the [Dec. 5, 2013, IBD Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/743661-how-to-trade-facebook-stock.htm) just before it broke out of a cup-shaped base.

  

Last October, the stock undercut the low in a prior flat base. That reset the base count, making its current cup-with-handle part of a first-stage base on base.

  

Volume on down days in the handle lightened up, showing that large investors were not selling aggressively. As Facebook got closer to the 82.09 buy point, volume on up days began to rise.

  

Trading was 45% above average Wednesday, and spiked again on Thursday's breakout, coming in more than 60% higher than normal.

  

The buy range is up to 5% above the buy point, from 82.09 to 86.19.

Today we'll look at **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), which develops, markets and distributes active apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. They've designed a full line of moisture-wicking clothing to combat any climate an athlete might face. Under Armour sells its products worldwide and is worn by athletes of all levels from professionals to weekend warriors and children.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After going negative in Q1 of last year, Under Armour's earnings growth has gained strength, and accelerated from 25% to 50% in the latest report. Revenue growth has been strong and steady, moving higher in each of the last three quarters. The stock is scheduled to report Q2 numbers on July 21.

  

After dipping at the end of last year, the number of funds that own Under Armour rose last quarter. Also, three typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX), Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and American Century All Cap Growth Investment (TWGTX).

  

The Up/Down Volume Ratio is a strong 1.9, indicating demand. And the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock has made a nice run since breaking out of a 33-week cup-with-handle in May 2013. It formed a shorter cup-with-handle in the early part of that move, and broke out in July, after reporting better than expected Q2 earnings in July. It rose 11% for the week.

  

From there, Under Armour climbed higher, finding good support along its 10-week moving average line. Although the stock did slip below that benchmark in January, it once again shot higher on another strong report for Q3. After notching a few gains, Under Armour pulled back in March and April, as the overall market fell into a correction.

  

Also around this time, some members of the U.S. speed skating squad alleged that defects in their Under Armour uniforms were slowing skaters down and costing the team medals. Investors dumped shares, causing the stock to plunge below its 10-week line on rising volume.

  

Under Armour eventually found support at the 40-week line and has continued to build the right side of its current consolidation, a third-stage base. The stock is currently working on its fifth consecutive week up.

  

Also note how the relative strength line has been trending higher.

  

If the base ends up being a cup-without-handle, the ideal buy point would be 62.50, 10 cents above the peak on the left. If Under Armour forms a handle, the ideal buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

**Stock Checkup**

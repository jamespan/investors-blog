Today we're going to look at **Eastman Chemical**, ([EMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMN)) which was profiled in a June 17 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/061413-660041-eastman-chemical-propels-growth-with-solutia-buy.htm).

  

It has a portfolio of businesses that provide products to a variety of industries like transportation, building and construction.

  

It's also sold some of its businesses and acquired others over the years, which cut its exposure to cyclical commodity chemical markets and increased its emphasis on faster-growing, more stable specialty chemical markets.

  

Its specialty chemicals include everything from an additive that reduces tire wear, to materials to prevent auto glass from shattering, to a fiber used in manufacturing cigarettes and as well as yarn.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

So let's see how that pencils out in terms of its fundamentals:

  

•Earnings growth slowed in the first part of last year but has been rebounding, ranging from 25% to 53% the past three quarters.

  

• Sales growth has also picked up, coming in at 27% last quarter.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts see earnings rising 18% this year and 11% next year.

  

• Return on equity is 33%, which is well above the 17% minimum you look for.

  

• Its debt-to-equity ratio is 162%, so it does have some debt. And that's also something to factor in.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-eastman-chemical-co-emn.aspx) shows Eastman has the best Composite Rating among the 12 stocks in the Chemical-Plastics industry group.

  

But that group is only ranked No. 164 among IBD's 197 groups. So it hasn't been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Eastman had a nice run in 2012 and the first part of this year, then fell into a base as you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart above.

  

That pattern doesn't neatly fit any of the typical types of bases. For instance, it's too deep to be a flat base.

  

You'll also notice Eastman has repeatedly run into resistance around the $73-$74 dollar a share level.

  

So watch to see if it can overcome that resistance. Either way it may be one to keep an eye on.

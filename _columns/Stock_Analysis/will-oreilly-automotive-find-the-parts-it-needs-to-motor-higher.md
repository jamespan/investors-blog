Today we'll look at **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)). Founded in 1957 by the O'Reilly family, the company operates over 4,100 stores in 42 states.

  

The firm is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies and equipment in the United States, with the ability to serve both professionals and the do-it-yourself market alike.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings have ranged from 19% to 37% over the last eight quarters. Look for the numbers to possibly increase as the company gets ready to report Q1 earnings April 23.

  

Although sales growth is well below the 25% gains you'd prefer to see, it did inch higher last quarter.

  

The number of funds that own O'Reilly dipped last quarter. But four typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: **Invesco Mid Cap Growth A** (VGRAX), **Fidelity Contrafund** (FCNTX), **American Century All Cap Growth**(TWGTX) and **T. Rowe Price New Horizons** (PRNHX).

  

The Up/Down Volume Ratio is 1.7, indicating demand. And O'Reilly's return on equity is a strong 33%.

  

The company's Earnings Stability Factor is a 4 out of a possible 99, which is actually good. That reading tells you how consistent a company's earnings have been in recent years. And the lower the number the more stable the earnings growth.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith chart on this page, the stock isn't very explosive and instead favors more steady trading.

  

But O'Reilly Automotive and other companies in its Retail/Wholesaleâ€”Auto Parts industry group have moved steadily higher in recent years.

  

When the economy is relatively weak or uncertain, consumers tend to put off buying new cars and repair the ones they already have themselves. O'Reilly and others benefit from that trend.

  

At the end of last year, note how the low in the base it was forming undercut the low in the prior base. That resets the base count, making this cup-shaped base a first-stage consolidation.

  

The stock tried to break out, but quickly pulled back to its 10-week line. Then it shot well above its previous high after reporting strong Q3 numbers.

  

Despite that big move the stock hasn't been able to do much as market conditions worsened and slipped into a correction.

  

Note how O'Reilly pulled back to start forming this current pattern before going up at least 20% from the prior buy point. That makes the current base pattern part of a first-stage base-on-base consolidation.

  

As you like to see, volume generally lightened up as the stock pulled back to its 10-week line, but it did end up slipping below that benchmark. While volume wasn't particularly heavy on that drop, it was higher than the previous week.

  

Watch if O'Reilly can recapture that line on stronger volume as it works on the right side of the pattern.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-o-reilly-automotive-inc-orly.aspx) shows O'Reilly scores a 97 EPS Rating and a 95 for its overall Composite Rating.

  

Its industry group is ranked No. 42 among IBD's 197 groups.

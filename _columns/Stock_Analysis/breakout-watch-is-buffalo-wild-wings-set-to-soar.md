With the restaurant industry group rising in the rankings, **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) may be one to add to your menu of stocks to watch.

  

Over the last week, the restaurant group, which also includes **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), **Chuy's Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), has jumped from the No. 53 spot to No. 39 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

That shows fund managers and other institutional investors have been moving money into the top restaurant stocks.

  

You can see that trend for Buffalo Wild Wings, with passing grades for its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 2.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio and seven quarters of increasing fund ownership.

  

Part of the appeal of the casual restaurant chain is its international expansion.

  

Buffalo Wild Wings has grown quickly in Mexico and the Philippines over the last year and just opened its first Middle East location in Dubai. A Saudi Arabia restaurant is scheduled to open later this month.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Second-quarter results for Buffalo Wild Wings came in below estimates for both sales and earnings.

  

Profits were hurt by the continued rise in the cost of chicken, which showed a 26% year-over-year increase. But that was less than the 41% price hike the company got hit with in Q1.

  

That slowdown appeared to be one reason the stock's share price moved higher despite the disappointing numbers.

  

Another catalyst was the announcement that Buffalo Wild Wings was completing its purchase of 41 franchised restaurants. Company-owned locations have been performing better than franchised restaurants, so that should help boost earnings down the road.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On July 29, the day after the Q2 earnings report, the stock gapped up to close more than 10% higher for the day on volume 405% above average. By the end of the week, it was up over 15% and just below a 195.93 buy point in a cup-shaped base.

  

Despite the market sell-off that followed, Buffalo Wild Wings has continued to show resilience with tight closes right around the entry price. And the Relative Strength line been trending sharply higher, a sign the stock is outperforming the general market.

  

That's healthy action during a correction and could mean Buffalo Wild Wings is poised to move higher when a new uptrend begins.

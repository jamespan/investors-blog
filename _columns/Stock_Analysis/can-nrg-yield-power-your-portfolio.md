Today we're going to look at a stock whose potential for success is fueled by a portfolio of power generation operations.

  

Profiled in [a Sept. 6 New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/090513-669939-power-producer-nrg-yield-thrives-as-mlp-stock-after-ipo.htm), **NRG Yield** ([NYLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NYLD)) is an offshoot of **NRG Energy** ([NRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NRG)) and operates a portfolio of contracted renewable energy, conventional generation facilities and thermal infrastructure assets.

  

It sells the power its facilities create to utility companies. It also pays dividends to shareholders.

  

When NRG Energy created NRG Yield, it sold them its long-term contracted assets. And analysts say the new company now owns the more "stable assets" with more concrete contracts in place than the parent company NRG.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• NRG Yield's profits totaled 51 cents a share in the second quarter compared to a 2-cent-share loss a year ago.

  

• Sales were up 88% year over year.

  

• Analysts predict earnings will climb 360% this year, but just 11% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-nrg-yield-inc-cl-a-nyld.aspx) shows NRG Yield's 91 Composite Rating is the third highest among the 36 stocks in its Energy-Alternative industry group.

  

**China Recycling Energy** ([CREG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREG)) and **Cleantech Solutions** ([CLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLNT)) carry higher ratings. But they both trade below 15 a share. And low-priced stocks often have a tough time attracting big, institutional investors.

  

The industry group as a whole is ranked No. 16 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows the stock came public in July at 22 a share and climbed as high as 29.45 in the days that followed.

  

Next it began forming a base pattern.

  

IPO bases can be shorter than traditional bases. So watch to see if it can break out of that pattern. If the market is in an uptrend, it could give investors a chance to get on board.

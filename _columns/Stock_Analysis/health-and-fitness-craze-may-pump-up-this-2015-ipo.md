Over half the 15 consumer companies that went public last year were tied -- directly or indirectly -- to the booming [health and wellness trend](https://www.investors.com/news/yoga-pants-and-ipos-athleisure-has-come-to-wall-street/). Among them was **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), which may be now getting in shape to break out of an IPO base.


Other 2015 IPOs with a focus on health include **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)), **Amplify Snack Brands** ([BETR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BETR)) and **Mindbody** ([MB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MB)), which makes scheduling software for gyms, spas and yoga centers. Even Fido got his fill of fitness with **Blue Buffalo Pet Products** ([BUFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUFF)).


Fitbit has floundered since peaking last August, and Amplify Snack Brands and Mindbody are trying to carve out new bases. Blue Buffalo is currently trading within a 26.08-27.38 buy zone. 


But among these Class of 2015 health and wellness IPOs, only Planet Fitness, which owns and franchises over 1,100 "non-intimidating" fitness centers, earns a 90 or higher Composite Rating. The New Hampshire-based company also has the highest Up/Down Volume Ratio (1.8) and Accumulation/Distribution Rating (B), indicating demand for its stock.


Institutional interest is driven by Planet Fitness' strong fundamentals, including a 41% three-year annual EPS growth rate, an 81% return on equity and a 26.6% annual pretax profit margin. The company also recently said it's on schedule to open a record number of new locations this year.


**Muscling Through An IPO Base**


Planet Fitness is working on an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/), and found support along the 10-week line while building the right side of the consolidation.


After reporting Q1 earnings on May 10, the stock rose for three straight weeks, closing at or near the top of the price range as its Relative Strength line moved sharply higher.


The current buy point is 20.78, but the stock may form a handle to offer an earlier entry.

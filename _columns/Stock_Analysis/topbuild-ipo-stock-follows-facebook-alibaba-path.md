Like many [big buzz IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) stumbled after their initial public offerings, then went on to big gains. Insulation products leader **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) has followed a similar path and has been trying to lay the foundation for another breakout run.









 
 
 From its first post-IPO weekly close on May 18, 2012, Facebook fell 54% over the next four months. It wasn't until July 2013 that the social media giant broke out and launched a fivefold run. Facebook was down 0.7% Wednesday and closed the day still in buy range.
Alibaba also declined in its second week of trading following its September 2014 initial public offering. Although the Chinese e-commerce leader managed to form an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/everything-you-need-to-know-about-buying-an-ipo/) a few weeks later, its gains were short-lived, as its stock went into a multiyear slump. It wasn't until the beginning of this year that Alibaba began a sustained upward move. Alibaba, which fell 1.4% Wednesday, is now back at the very upper end of its buy range.


In similar fashion, TopBuild tried to head higher following its July 2015 IPO, but then went through a long period of roller-coaster action until launching a strong breakout at the end of February of this year.


Since then, TopBuild's share price rose as much as 70% before pulling back to form its current consolidation, a [flat base](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 67.37 entry.


Note that it's a later-stage base and those entail more risk than a first- or second-stage pattern, which has been apparent this week as the stock has fallen after reporting earnings on Tuesday.



69% Annual EPS Growth
---------------------


TopBuild sports a three-year annual earnings growth rate of 69%, but that's down from the 74% pace it had prior to Tuesday's earnings release. The company has posted average EPS gains of 45% over the last three quarters.


Sales growth has been less impressive, coming in at just 8%, on average, over the last three years. After two quarters of rising top line growth, revenue gains slipped from 10% to 8% in the third quarter.


On Tuesday, TopBuild fell sharply in heavy volume, but managed to recoup a large portion of the day's losses and close above the 50-day line. On Wednesday, the stock finished strong to erase its morning losses and retake its 50-day moving average.


See TopBuild can finish the base and break outÂ  in heavy volume. Also [keep a close eye on general market conditions](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) to see if the underlying uptrend holds.

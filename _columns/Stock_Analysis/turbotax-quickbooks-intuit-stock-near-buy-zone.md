With tax season kicking into high gear, TurboTax and QuickBooks parent **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) may generate future capital gains with a new breakout move.




In addition to TurboTax and the QuickBooks accounting software for self-employed people and small businesses, Intuit also offers money-management tool Mint. From personal budgets and investments to bills and credit scores, Mint enables people to track all aspects of their finances on one platform.


Based in Mountain View, Calif., Intuit employs approximately 9,000 people globally, with 19 locations in nine countries. The company serves an estimated 50 million customers worldwide.


Revenue for fiscal 2018 (ended July 31, 2018) was $6 billion. While announcing results for its fiscal 2019 first quarter (ended Oct. 31, 2018) on Nov. 19, Intuit said it expects fiscal 2019 sales to come in between $6.53 billion and $6.63 billion, a growth rate of 8% to 10%.

TurboTax Helps Drive 34% Profit Margins
---------------------------------------


With a [95 Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Intuit holds the No. 3 ranking among financial software stocks. **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) tops the group with the highest-possible 99 rating.


Intuit sports a 34% annual pretax profit margin and an 82% return on equity. It also boasts an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks the key ingredients for earnings growth — sales, profit margins and ROE — as a whole.


On Nov. 19, the company blew past analyst estimates when it reported a 71% increase in earnings for its fiscal 2019 first quarter. Analysts are looking for just a 3% rise when Intuit reports its performance for fiscal Q2 (ended Jan. 31) on Feb. 21.


Intuit Stock Resets Base Count
------------------------------


Since crashing below its 10-week moving average on a weak earnings report August 2015, Intuit stock has been rising steadily higher. From the low of 79.63 it hit that month through an all-time high of 231.84 it reached in October of last year, the stock rose 191%. During that run, the stock consistently found support along its benchmark 10-week line.


As a bear market took hold in Q4, Intuit stock pulled to begin forming its current consolidation. While building that pattern, it undercut the low in its prior flat base to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


Intuit closed Thursday's session up just under 1% at 230.78, leaving it slightly below the new 231.94 entry in this first-stage pattern.


On Friday, Intuit closed in the buy zone with a strong finish for a 1.1% gain to 233.32. Volume in the final our was heavy.


A 1.0 up/down volume ratio and B Accumulation/Distribution Rating point to institutional demand for Intuit stock.

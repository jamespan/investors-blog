With the 2016 stock market off to an historically weak start, all eyes are on earnings season. Will the numbers from market leaders like **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), set to report after the close Thursday, get the bulls raging again or have the bears sharpening their claws?


The coffee giant's fiscal-first-quarter report follows Tuesday's earnings beat by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), and precedes the latest numbers from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), expected Jan. 27.


Each company is the dominant player in its industry, and each stock has been testing support between the 10-week and 40-week moving average lines. How Starbucks, Netflix and Facebook fare in those tests will be an important bellwether for the strength of the overall market.

Starbucks has posted 18% sales growth in each of the last three quarters, while earnings growth has ranged from 16% to 24% during that time.


The Seattle-based coffee chain is expected to report slightly decelerating numbers for its most recent quarter, but show [growth in same-store sales](http://news.investors.com/business/011916-790389-starbucks-earnings-revenue-seen-slowing-slightly.htm), helped by the popularity of its Mobile Order & Pay app.


For fiscal 2016, which ends in September, analysts expect earnings-per-share to rise 20%, followed by a 15% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Starbucks pays a dividend currently yielding 1.1% and sports a strong 43% return on equity.


Overall, the stock earns a 97 Composite Rating, but its lowly D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating reflects the institutional selling seen in recent weeks. Also, the number of funds with a position in the stock dipped last quarter from 2263 to 2240.


But on the positive side, four typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock, including **Fidelity Contrafund** (FCNTX) and **American Century All Cap Growth**(TWGTX).


**Support Or Resistance?**


Starbucks kicked off 2015 with a breakout from a flat base, rising over 50% before peaking in October.


It looked like it might form a short and shallow pattern at the end of last year, but has ended up pulling back as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sold off.


The stock lost two key areas of support along the way: the 10-week and the 59.42 prior buy point. Also note how the 10-week line has started to act like a ceiling of resistance in recent weeks.


Like Netflix and Facebook, Starbucks is now testing its next line of defense, the 40-week moving average.


If the java giant reports well and finds support at that benchmark, it could continue forming the right side of its current base and break out when a new market uptrend eventually begins.

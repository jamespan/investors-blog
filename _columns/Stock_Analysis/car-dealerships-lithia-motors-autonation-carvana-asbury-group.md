Looking for the [top-rated stocks in the top-ranked industry groups](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-find-the-top-rated-stocks-in-the-top-ranked-industries/) is always a good way to jump-start your search for winning stocks. **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)), a leader in the No. 2-ranked car dealers industry group, of the 197 groups IBD tracks, is just one example. **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)), **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) and **Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) also rank among the top stocks to watch.




Institutional investors have shown interest in stocks associated with the car dealerships. At least 10 stocks with a 90 or higher [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) are featured among the leading car dealerships.


A 90 or higher Composite Rating tells you the stock is outperforming at least 90% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Lithia Motors, CarMax, AutoNation, **America's Car-Mart** ([CRMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRMT)), and **Asbury Automotive Group** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)) all make the grade.


With a 77 Composite Rating, Carvana comes up shy of the 90 or higher benchmark, but it's still showing promising technical strength.

Car Dealerships To Watch: Lithia Motors Nears Buy Point
-------------------------------------------------------


Based in Medford, Ore., Lithia Motors operates 188 auto dealerships around the country. Fortune lists it as one of the fastest-growing companies in the Fortune 500 (#294 in 2018).


Lithia Motors formed a long and deep base that began in February 2018. The stock showed mostly tight, healthy trading and consistent support along its 10-week line while building that formation.


The stock broke out on earnings in July. While it quickly pulled back following that breakout, Lithia Motors held the bulk of its prior gains and formed another base. In a sign of gathering strength, it was a shorter and shallower [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


The latest consolidation is considered part of a [first-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), with the stock still within striking distance of a new 52-week high. Lithia Motors is currently trading just 5% below the potential [139.28 entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


On Friday, Lithia Motors gapped down in above-average volume, but the stock came off off its lows to close above its 50-day line. The stock ended the week at 128.32, 8% below the entry.



Fellow car dealerships CarMax, AutoNation, **Rush Enterprises** ([RUSHA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUSHA)), America's Car-Mart, and Carvana are also in or near new buy zones.

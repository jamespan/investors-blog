Floor & Decor Finds Support After Coronavirus Stock Market Crash
----------------------------------------------------------------


Floor & Decor is a specialty retailer operating 123 warehouse-format stores across 30 states. The Atlanta-based company offers a broad range of hard-surface flooring, including tile, wood, laminate and natural stone, as well as installation services.


Founded in 2000 and trading publicly since an IPO in April 2017, Floor & Decor has seen 94 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-find-stocks-to-watch-amzn-aapl-msft-nvda-nflx/) with an A+ rating from IBD report owning shares of FND stock.


Over the past three years, Floor & Decor has generated average annual EPS growth of 30%. Analysts expect the company to see earnings growth decline -25% for 2020, but rebound to a 49% gain in 2021.


FND Stock Tests Cup-With-Handle Buy Zone
----------------------------------------


Paralleling the general stock market action, FND stock has rebounded from the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) in a V-shape formation. The stock is now breaking above a 57.99 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


To further confirm that technical resilience, FND's [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/)Â is edging back above its longer-term 40-week moving average.


One key factor to monitor when learning [how to read stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) is the concept of support and resistance. Just as Floor & Decor specializes in selling hardwood flooring and tile, you want to see a stock establish a solid floor after it sells off. From that floor, you want to see the stock bounce back until it encounters, and hopefully clears, a new ceiling of resistance.


FND stock is now trying to do that. The question becomes whether Floor & Decor can decisively punch through that ceiling (or most recent point of resistance) in strong volume. That point of resistance is the peak in the handle. To get the ideal buy point, we add 10 cents to that price just to make sure FND can overcome that resistance, rather than bang its head against it and retreat.


Note that FND's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been rising into new-high ground, a sign of market leadership as the stock tries to break out.

With the [price of crude](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-demands-opec-lower-oil-prices-but-crude-rises-on-supply-worries/) briefly topping $75 a barrel, Wall Street's attention has turned to oil stocks like **Exxon** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)), **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) and **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)). Large investors may also be primed to pump up drilling equipment maker **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) into a new buy zone.




As a top 2018 IPO stock, Cactus has earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) list. The Houston-based company makes, sells and rents highly engineered wellheads and pressure control equipment. Its products and services are primarily used for onshore, unconventional oil and gas wells.


Cactus has delivered two straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, including a 483% gain in Q1. Analysts are looking for a 90% increase for the second quarter, and for a 91% rise for the full year and 25% gain in 2019. Consensus earnings estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


On the revenue side, Cactus just missed posting a fourth straight quarter of triple-digit sales growth in Q1 with a still-impressive 97% increase.

Oil Stocks Near Buy Points
--------------------------


Cactus is among several oil stocks forming new [chart patterns](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) or trading within new buy zones.


Since its Feb. 8 initial public offering, Cactus has made an impressive run â€” certainly better than the [big-buzz market debuts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-dropbox-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/) of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)).


Since peaking in late May, the stock has been building a cup with handle showing a 35.29 entry. In the bottom of the base, Cactus has consistently found support at its 10-week line. While a 1.5 up/down volume ratio points to demand, the relative strength line remains below new-high ground. Look for the line to rise sharply as Cactus tries to clear the buy point in volume at least 40% above average. The stock on Friday traded 2% below the entry.



Fellow energy sector and oil stocks Exxon and ConocoPhillips are also working on bases, while Occidental Petroleum has been flashing a string of tight weekly closes as it trades right along its 10-week line. Exxon is trying to drill through an 83.89 buy point, while ConocoPhillips is exploring a 71.81 entry.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), which has been [hitting resistance](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) around the 138 mark, is trying to break out of a 138.24 buy point in a cup-shaped pattern.

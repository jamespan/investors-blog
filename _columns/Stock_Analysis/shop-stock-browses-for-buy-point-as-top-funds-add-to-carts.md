Top money managers are piling shares of **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) into their carts. A *lot* of shares. That support has [SHOP stock](https://www.investors.com/research/shopify-stock-buy-now/) browsing for a fresh breakout after already making a massive move since 2016.




In the latest report on new [buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-in-tech-stock-googl-stock-shopify-nvidia/), Shopify garnered an estimated total of $1.1 billion from these top funds. Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) joined SHOP stock in the billion-dollar club as [GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) took in a massive $1.5 billion.


In the next report, due out later this month, SHOP stock again made the list, raking in an additional $1.3 billion. GOOGL stock also makes the cut, with top investors picking up $1.6 billion worth of shares.


As many as 329 of the best mutual funds with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in Shopify stock. For those keeping score at home, 446 A+ funds own shares in Alphabet.


But Wait, There's More! Shopify Unveils Major Platform Investments
------------------------------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify is a leading global commerce company, providing tools to start, grow, market and manage a retail business of any size. Shopify powers over one million businesses in more than 175 countries.


At [Shopify Unite 2021](https://news.shopify.com/the-most-flexible-scalable-and-high-performing-shopify-ever-major-platform-investments-unveiled-at-unite-2021-give-entrepreneurs-limitless-creative-power-pjejqz) in late June, the enterprise software company unveiled enhancements to its storefront and checkout processes. With major investments, Shopify says it has created the most flexible and scalable platform ever.


New features and enhancements include custom storefronts and its Online Store 2.0. The new online store platform will include Shopify Theme Store, providing merchants more creative options for their storefronts.


Shopify also has addressed retailers' ever-growing need for speed. The new Shopify Checkout will help any shop handle tens of thousands of purchases per minute. Shopify has also introduced Checkout Extensions, allowing developers to beef up security in Shopify Checkout.


These and other moves helped Shopify generate powerful growth. Over the last three quarters, the company generated average EPS growth of 446%. Over the last three years, Shopify has delivered average annual earnings growth of 230%.


Sales growth has also been impressive. Including 57% revenue growth last quarter, Shopify has generated sales gains ranging from 45% to 110% over the last eight quarters.


Along with that fundamental performance, Shopify also made IBD's list of today's [most-trusted tech companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/data-privacy-gaining-trust-fuels-commerce-ibd-tipp/).


SHOP Stock Nears Another Breakout After Raucous, But Rocky, Run
---------------------------------------------------------------


A look at the monthly chart shows Shopify stock soared as much as 6,743% from the lows following its 2015 [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) through the end of July 2021. But SHOP stock has certainly taken some bumpy rides along the way.


One was a 33% decline from February to June of this year as the stock formed a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Shopify completed and broke out of that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) ahead of a July 28 earnings report but failed to gain traction.


Since reporting, SHOP stock has continued to work on a flat base showing a 1,650.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock has encountered some light-volume resistance since reporting but remains above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


The rocky [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) reflects both the sharper sell-off in the prior base and the current pattern setting up. Look for the RS line to move higher as SHOP stock tries to revamp its base just as Shopify has refashioned its platform.


SHOP stock closed the week 6% shy of the buy point.

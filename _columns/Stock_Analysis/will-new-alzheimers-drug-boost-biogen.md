Today we'll check in on **Biogen Idec**  ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), which develops treatments for multiple sclerosis, cancer and autoimmune diseases. It's also been working on a drug to slow Alzheimer's, called BIIB-037.

  

Earlier this week, Biogen said it's moving that drug into late-stage testing after early results showed promise for some Alzheimer's patients.

  

Experts noted the study is not yet complete and promising early-stage results are no guarantee of ultimate success. But since there's currently no available treatment for Alzheimer's, the potential for such a drug is enormous.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Biogen has already been posting strong sales growth, ranging from 21% to 51% over the last six quarters. Earnings growth has also been strong, rising to 62% in Q3.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 51%, followed by a 20% gain in 2015.

  

The company sports a solid 27% return on equity and 99 Composite Rating. Its Medical â€” Biomed/Biotech industry group earns a 98 Group RS Rating and is currently ranked No. 5 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

Biogen's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating is up from a D+ just two weeks ago.

  

And as you like to see, the number of funds that own shares has been on the rise, including an increase of 107 funds last quarter.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Biogen's share price has more than doubled since a breakout in early 2013.

  

In March of this year it sold off sharply for a few weeks on heavy volume. Many biotech and pharmaceutical stocks sold off at the time, as members of Congress questioned the high cost of several drugs.

  

But Biogen found support around its 40-week moving average line.

  

It tried to build the right side of a new base, but hit resistance around $349 and began work on a new consolidation.

  

On Oct. 22, Biogen sold off during the day on Q3 earnings, but rebounded to close in the top of its price range.

  

Volume was huge, 456% higher than normal. Although the stock closed lower for the day, the positive reversal was a mitigating factor and pointed to institutional support.

  

In late October and early November, Biogen tried to reclaim its 10-week line, but hit resistance and fell back below it.

  

On Tuesday, the stock gapped up to close above that benchmark line. That came on news Biogen's Alzheimer's drug had performed well in early-stage trials.

  

Volume was 288% higher than normal, and volume was again well above average on Wednesday, as the stock closed up nearly 6% for the day.

  

The ideal buy point is 349.10, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

In early trading Thursday morning, Biogen poked its head above that price, but slipped back below it. See if the stock can break out decisively on volume at least 40% - 50% above average.

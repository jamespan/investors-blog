After forming two long and deep bases, iRobot stock is building a much shallower pattern as it nears an all-time high. As the maker of the Roomba vacuum, can **iRobot** ([IRBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRBT)) sweep up more gains for investors with a new breakout?




Like a Roomba vacuum sensing a table leg or other obstacle and retreating, iRobot has hit multiple [points of resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and struggled to move forward since the second half of 2017. But it's been showing signs of a technical rebound.


After forming a 56-week correction with a 49% decline, iRobot stock formed a 23-week chart pattern with a 39% drop. Its current base is just seven weeks long with a depth of only 14%. Plus, unlike in its prior two corrections, the stock has stayed above the benchmark 10-week line while forming its current [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


The succession of higher lows and shallower chart patterns are signs of a technical rebound, and could mean iRobot is setting up for a more sustained climb.

No. 1 Ranking For iRobot Stock
------------------------------


Along with commercial and residential cooking equipment maker and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Middleby** ([MIDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIDD)), iRobot shares the No. 1 ranking among household appliances stocks with a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The industry ranks No. 28 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Over the last three quarters, iRobot has generated average EPS growth of 117%, although the pace of that growth has been slowing. In Q4, the Bedford, Mass.-based company reported a 56% increase, down from 87% in Q3. But the fourth-quarter number topped analyst estimates by 68%.


Sales growth over the last eight quarters has ranged from 18% to 54%.


The company also generates solid annual cash flow of $4.39 per share, compared with annual earnings per share of $2.98 in 2018. For growth companies, look for [cash flow per share](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-cash-flow-may-matter-more-than-profits-sales/) at least 20% higher than earnings per share.


The leading consumer robot firm is scheduled to report Q1 numbers after the stock market close on April 23. Analysts expect EPS growth to slow by 9%.

New Breakout At New All-Time High?
----------------------------------


The new buy point for iRobot stock is 132.98, 10 cents above the peak in its new base. A breakout would also mark a new all-time high for iRobot, which went public in November 2005.


As the stock has shown signs of a technical rebound in recent months, it's also shown signs of strong institutional demand, including earning a spot on the latest report on [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-alibaba-netflix-amazon-paypal-microsoft-salesforce/). The stock also sports a 2.7 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


See if iRobot stock can push through a buy point in volume at least 40% above average. But keep in mind that it's [risky to buy a stock just before earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/should-you-buy-stock-ahead-of-earnings/). It's best to wait to see the numbers and how Wall Street reacts before jumping in.

As the American population ages, demand for hospice care and in-home health care continues to rise. And **LHC Group** ([LHCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHCG)) is a leader in that growing industry, making it one of today's top stocks to watch.




When the market [shifts from correction to uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), investors should be prepared with a list of stocks to watch by focusing on the [top-rated stocks in the top-ranked industries](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3853550). Special attention should be paid to those that are also [building chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) as the market tries to set up a new uptrend.


By earning the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) as it jumps into a new buy zone from an early-stage cup with handle, LHC fits that bill and qualifies as one of the top stocks to watch in the current market.

No. 1-Ranked Hospice Care Provider
----------------------------------


LHC shares the No. 1 ranking among home health care and hospice care providers. Fellow industry group leaders include **Addus Homecare** ([ADUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADUS)), **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) and **U.S. Physical Therapy** ([USPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USPH)). The group itself now ranks No. 5 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.


The Top 10 industry ranking shows institutional demand for the group as a whole. A 1.76 up/down volume ratio, B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and two quarters of rising fund ownership indicate demand specifically for shares in LHC.


The Louisiana-based company has approximately 32,000 employees providing home health care and hospice care in over 780 locations in 36 states. LHC Group is the preferred home health care provider for 330 hospitals around the country.


LHC has posted three quarters of rising earnings growth, including a jump from 33% to 48% in Q3. Analyst EPS estimates for 2018 (48%) and 2019 (19%) were both recently revised higher.


Boosted by the closure of its [merger with Almost Family](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2018/04/lhc-group-closes-almost-family-merger-charts-future-course/) for $850 million earlier this year, LHC's revenue soared 95% in Q2 and 88% in Q3. After posting sales of just under $270 million in Q3 2017, the company generated over $500 million in both the second and third quarters of this year.


By comparison, Amedisys generated $417 million in Q3, while Addus Homecare ($138 million) and U.S. Physical Therapy ($113 million) both came in under $150 million for the quarter.


Stocks To Watch: Rising Relative Strength
-----------------------------------------


LHC Group gained more than 10% for the week after reporting Q3 earnings on Oct. 31. The stock has since eased back in lighter volume to form a handle in a second-stage cup with handle. It briefly cleared the 100.08 entry on Nov. 16 but slipped back below that entry.


On Monday, the stock rose more than 3% in below-average but rising volume. On Tuesday, LHC managed to bounce back from a small decline in the morning to end the day with a 0.3% gain to 99.41. Volume was below average.


On Wednesday, LHC Group gapped up to enter the buy zone, which extends to 105.08. It closed the day up 4.6% to finish at 103.97. The stock was adding to those gains early Thursday and is now trading at the upper end of the buy range.


In a sign of market leadership, the relative strength line was already in new-high ground ahead of the breakout.


Keep in mind that while the stock market is showing signs of a rebound, it remains volatile. But with strong fundamentals and signs of resilience in a down market, LHC Group is among the stocks to watch as we wait for a sustainable uptrend to take hold.

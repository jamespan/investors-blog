**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) may lose its [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) card to **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), which sports a larger market-capitalization weighting on the Nasdaq. But **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) remains the undisputed king, accounting for 10.3% of the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Now [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) looks to expand its lead with a fresh breakout.




**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) took a hit Thursday after [reporting earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-fiscal-q2-2025-earnings-nvda-stock/), giving **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) a chance to slip into the No. 2 spot in terms of market capitalization weighting on the Nasdaq. As of Thursday's close, Apple accounted for 10.3% of the tech-heavy index, followed by Microsoft's 9%. [Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/) slipped to 8.5%.


On Friday, Nvidia came off the day's lows to close right around its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It ended the week above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Apple Stock Targets Breakout To Record High
-------------------------------------------


[Tesla](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/) remains stuck below its 50-day line but closed the week above its 21-day line. The electric vehicle maker looks to craft a new base but remains 22% below a potential buy point.


Nvidia has also lost some luster [despite bullish calls from analysts](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-drops-despite-bullish-analyst-calls-for-ai-chipmaker/). Yet, its recent pullback puts a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-how-to-spot-a-good-one/) on the base, making 130 a viable entry. But investors should note it's a late-stage pattern, which entails more risk, particularly after having already made a huge run.


Meanwhile, Apple continues to target a breakout from an early-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). The buy point is 237.23.


Showing resilience Friday, the iPhone maker came off its lows to end with just a fractional loss. Apple ended the week 3% shy of a breakout and solidly above its 10-week line. Note how the 21-day line stands poised to move decisively above the longer-term 50-day line. Such a move would point to rising technical strength for Apple stock.


While forming that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/), the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) for Apple stock has moved mostly sideways. But showing resilience and market leadership, the RS line has perked up and remains within striking distance of its 52-week high.

Bringing AI To iPhones Through Apple Intelligence
-------------------------------------------------


Earlier this month, billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb said he [sees room for shares of Apple stock to climb](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-seen-getting-lift-from-ai-opportunity/). In a letter to investors, Loeb said Apple will benefit from adding artificial intelligence technology to its iPhones, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/third-point-sees-room-apple-stock-price-climb-letter-says-2024-08-23/) reported. In July, the stock also received a pair of [upbeat reports](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-hits-record-high-upbeat-analyst-reports/) from analysts as Apple begins to add AI to its products.


By building [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/) into the iPhone, iPad and Mac, the company aims to deliver what it calls "AI for the rest of us." It aims to enhance personalization of content and context while simultaneously expanding privacy within AI. Apple says the platform will assist users with features such as Writing Tools, Image Wand, Genmoji and the Image Playground.


Apple began unveiling several new AI features at its [Worldwide Developers Conference](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-wwdc-2024-ai-strategy/) with more coming, including the release of the iPhone 16 at its [fall product launch on Sept. 9](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/). The company may also pivot to smart glasses with [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-pivot-smart-glasses-from-vision-pro/), which is currently a low-volume, niche device.

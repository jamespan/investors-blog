Long before mobile computing and the Internet of Things became the buzzwords of the day, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was pioneering the related concept of cloud-based software.

  

The leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software continues to innovate. At last month's Dreamforce 2015 conference, CEO Marc Benioff announced SalesforceIQ, a CRM solution for small business, and an IoT cloud-services offering called Thunderbird.

  

Just weeks later, **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) announced its own Internet of Things-focused service called AWS IoT, adding to to its market-leading Amazon Web Services business.

  

**Passing Grades**

  

Salesforce's 34% five-year annual sales growth rate helps it earn a 98 Composite Rating and puts it on pace to become the world's fourth-largest software firm by 2016, behind **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)).

  

Earnings growth has ranged from 44% to 100% over the past five quarters.

  

The San Francisco-based firm isn't expected to report Q3 earnings until the second half of November, but peers within its industry group, such as **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) and **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)), are scheduled to report sooner.

  

The stock also earns passing grades for its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.6 up/down volume ratio.

  

**Breaks Out, Still In Buy Zone**

  

On Tuesday, the stock cleared a 76.31 buy point but gave back a large chunk of the day's gains to close in the bottom half of the range. Volume was 32% above average.

  

The stock fell below the entry in light volume on Wednesday, then regained the buy point Thursday. But volume was disappointing, coming in 23% lower than normal.

  

On Friday, Salesforce closed within the 76.31 to 80.13 buy range.

The outlook for homebuilders has picked up, with **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) breaking out and the [**Pending Home Sales Index**](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/companies-continue-to-hire-faster-than-theyre-growing/) hitting its second-highest reading in a decade. Will **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) be the next housing stock to break out?


Building Bases
--------------


The Atlanta-based builder, which operates in 50 markets across 26 states, has been working on a first-stage **[flat base](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=3)** with a 22.50 entry.


While fellow homebuilders **KB Homes** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **M/I Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) have also been trying to lay the foundation for a potential new run, Pulte's chart pattern has generally shown tighter trading with consistent support along the 10-week moving average.


But that support is now being tested. KB Home, D.R. Horton and other industry peers also fell.


Among homebuilder stocks, Pulte ranks No. 2 with a 93 [**Composite Rating**](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771), just behind LGI Homes. KB Home, M/I Homes and **Tri Pointe** ([TPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPH)) round out the top five.


Raising The Roof?
-----------------


PulteGroup has shown a strong rebound in earnings and sales over the last three quarters.



Earnings per share have bounced back from a string of reports showing negative growth to accelerating gains of 33%, 60% and 61% in Q4, Q1 and Q2. Revenue has grown 13%, 26% and 41% during the same period. Earnings estimates for 2017 were recently revised higher to 33%.


While the number of mutual funds with a position in Pulte edged slightly lower last quarter, two typically better-performing funds own shares, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).


The stock's [**Accumulation/Distribution Rating**](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771) of B indicates moderate institutional buying over the last 13 weeks, and its 1.4 up/down volume ratio confirms demand for shares.


Watch for PulteGroup to continue to find support at the 10-week line and clear the 22.50 entry in volume at least 40% above average.

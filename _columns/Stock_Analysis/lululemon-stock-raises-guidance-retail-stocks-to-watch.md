Retail Stocks To Watch
----------------------


On Dec. 6, Lululemon announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter, ended Oct. 28. Revenue rose 21% to $747.7 million, marking a third straight quarter of 20%-plus gains, albeit a slowdown from 25% increases in Q1 and Q2.


Earnings growth also slowed from an 82% spike in Q2 to a still-solid 34% rise in the third quarter. Lululemon has now posted average EPS growth of 62% over the last three quarterly reports.


Boosted by a 19% annual pretax profit margin and 24% return on equity, Lululemon sports a strong A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole.


Seven quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand. Plus, 75 of the [best mutual funds,](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-reit-stocks-medical-stocks/) with an A+ rating from IBD, own Lululemon shares.


Is Lululemon Stock Stretching For New Run?
------------------------------------------


From the low of 47.26 it hit in May 2017, Lululemon rose 249% before starting to form its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in October 2018. Within the consolidation, the stock corrected 33%, an acceptable decline.


Since finding a bottom in the new base, Lululemon stock has rebounded to retake both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. While building the right side of its base, the stock posted two gap-ups in above-average volume, on Jan. 14 and 18. Such moves within a chart pattern point to accumulation by large investors.


In a sign of market leadership, Lululemon's relative strength line is at a new 52-week high ahead of a potential breakout.


As one of the top-rated stocks to watch, keep an eye on Lululemon to see if it completes its base and clears the 164.89 buy point in heavy trade.


On Friday, the stock rose over 2% to close at  151.89, putting it 8% below the entry.

Known for its huge showrooms, hefty catalogs and classic style, **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is getting ready to introduce a new minimalist concept this fall called [RH Modern](http://news.investors.com/business/062615-759188-restoration-hardware-rh-modern-analyst-upgrade.htm).

  

The new stores will target the luxury market and be six to eight times larger than Restoration's normal locations.

  

BB&T Capital Markets recently upgraded the home furnishings retailer, saying it believes RH Modern will diversify Restoration's design aesthetic and attract new customers.

  

Competitor **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) also has a modern line, West Elm, which is popular among millennials.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth fell last quarter from 24% to 15%, but earnings rose from 23% to 28%.

  

The home furnishing industry group ranked a lowly No. 145 in Thursday's edition, but Restoration earns a best-in-group score for its 91 Composite Rating.

  

Demand for the stock is reflected in the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and the rise in fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since the end of last year, Restoration Hardware's stock has hit resistance around the 100 mark multiple times.

  

It's now working on a [cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787) base as part of a second-stage pattern.

  

The relative strength line is near new high ground, and heavy volume in the right side of the base points to institutional buying.

  

On June 26, Restoration Hardware managed to close just above the 99.09 buy point on volume 153% above average. It pulled back the next day, but found support at the 10-day line.

  

It tried to break out again Wednesday, but reversed to close below the buy point. See if the stock can punch decisively past the entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

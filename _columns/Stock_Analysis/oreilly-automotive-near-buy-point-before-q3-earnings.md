Earnings season will likely make or break the current stock market uptrend. And **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is trying to spark its own breakout as it gets ready to report Q3 numbers on Oct. 28.

  

O'Reilly's 99 Composite Rating is tops among its peers in the Retail/Wholesale â€” Auto Parts industry group.

  

The group's ranking has moved up from No. 75 three months ago to No. 18. Like O'Reilly, fellow auto parts retailers **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)),**Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), **Pep Boys-Manny Moe Jack** ([PBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBY)) and **Monro Muffler Brake** ([MNRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNRO)) are also trading near potential buy points.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Especially in an uncertain economy, institutional investors like companies with steady earnings and sales growth. O'Reilly Automotive fits that bill, with revenue gains ranging from 8% to 10% over the last eight quarters.

  

Earnings growth has come in between 18% and 28% during that same period.

  

O'Reilly's 39% return on equity and 25% annual EPS growth rate have helped earn it the No. 1 spot on the IBD Big Cap 20, which has shown signs of [sector rotation](http://news.investors.com/investing-inside-big-cap-20/100515-774125-where-is-stock-leadership.htm) recently as mutual fund managers move away from medical stocks and into new industries.

  

O'Reilly's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership reflect institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

You can also see signs of that demand within the chart.

  

The stock has a long track record of tight trading with good support along the 10-week line.

  

O'Reilly Automotive is currently working on a flat base that is part of a larger, second-stage [base-on-base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/674610-base-on-base-structures-can-yield-big-breakouts.htm) formation.

  

Within that pattern, the stock once again found support at the 10-week moving average. Recent spikes in weekly volume show that fund managers and other large investors have been stepping to protect or add to their positions.

  

The buy point is 258.25, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

See if O'Reilly can clear that entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal. And keep a close eye on the nascent uptrend to see if it continues to gain traction.

When the market goes through a rocky phase, pay close attention to stocks like **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) that weather the storm better than most. Like drugmakers **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) and **Perrigo** ([PRGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGO)), contract research organization (CRO) Icon is [based in Ireland](http://news.investors.com/investing-international-leaders/082615-768312-overseas-ibd-50-leaders-test-support.htm).

  

It provides phase one to phase four clinical trial services to help pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies bring their products to market more quickly and at lower cost.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

On July 28, Icon posted mixed results for Q2, beating on earnings but missing on revenue.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 37%, followed by a 19% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

In addition to a 19% return on equity, Icon sports a five-year annual EPS growth rate of 27%. Its three-year growth rate is even more impressive, at 82%.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock has already made a big run, rising more than 200% from a breakout in July 2012 until it pulled back to form a later-stage base in March of this year.

  

It shot past a 72.50 buy point in huge volume on July 28 after beating earnings views, raising full-year guidance and increasing its stock buyback program by $400 million.

  

It was adding to those gains in tight trading until it got dragged down by the recent sell-off in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

  

But Icon found support at the 10-week moving average and bounced back above it.

  

While the stock is in a proper buying zone, see if Icon offers a new entry once a new market uptrend begins.

  

But keep in mind that the recent base was later-stage, and that entails more risk.

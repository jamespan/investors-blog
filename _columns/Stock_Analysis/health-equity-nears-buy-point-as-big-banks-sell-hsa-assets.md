While **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **U.S. Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)) and other large financial institutions have been exiting the [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/what-is-an-hsa-health-savings-account/) business, **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)), one of the nation's largest [HSA administrators](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/best-health-savings-account-providers/), continues to grow.


Healthy Profits
---------------


Despite fears that ObamaCare regulations would curtail or kill HSAs, deposits and investment assets have continued to grow in recent years, reaching $30.2 billion in 2015 -- about triple the amount in 2009.


But because the sums pale in comparison to that of 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, Wells Fargo and other big banks have decided to focus on the latter, allowing HealthEquity to grow its portfolio by purchasing their assets, including picking up a total of 195,000 HSA accounts with $453 million in assets from **M&T Bank** ([MTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTB)) and **Bancorp** ([TBBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBK)).


Working with 80 health plan partners and 33,000 companies across the U.S., HealthEquity now services 2.2 million HSAs with $4 billion under management.


The Utah-based company sports strong three-year annual growth rates for earnings (69%) and sales (42%). EPS growth has averaged 52% over the past three quarters, and fiscal 2017 Q2 numbers are expected to be released Sept. 6.


Breakout Ahead?
---------------


At the end of last year, the stock fell into a deep decline before finding its footing in February. It's recovered nicely, finding good support along the 10-week moving average, and is now working on a flat base with a 31.79 entry.



On Tuesday, HealthEquity reclaimed its 50-day line in heavy and rising volume, and managed to edge higher on Wednesday despite a sell-off in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


But with the [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/) now shifted from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure, it's riskier to make new buys.


Be extra picky about establishing new positions in this environment, and look for volume to spike at least 40% on the day of an attempted breakout.

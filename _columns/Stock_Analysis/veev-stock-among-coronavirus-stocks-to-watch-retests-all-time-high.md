As a result, VEEV stock is once again testing a recent breakout and all-time high.

After 903% Gain, Will 40% Margins Lift Veeva Stock Even Higher?
---------------------------------------------------------------


Since a breakout in June 2016, VEEV stock has catapulted as much as 903%.


Veeva is already on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). The cloud play also made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/stocks-to-watch-best-mutual-funds-buy-amazon-zoom-video-alibaba-apple-stock/). With a strong earnings stability rating of 5 (the lower the number, the more stable the earnings), VEEV stock has now earned a spot on the watchlist for [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/).


The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company sports a 40% pretax annual profit margin and a 24% return on equity from the fiscal year ended last January. For those numbers and several other metrics, VEEV stock merits passing grades in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). The stock also earns a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning it's outpacing 98% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Over the last three years, Veeva has generated average annual earnings growth of 46%. Analysts expect a 22% gain for the current fiscal year.


VEEV Stock Tests Buy Point And New All-Time High
------------------------------------------------


Although it cleared a generally riskier, late-stage base, Veeva rose steadily after breaking out of a 33%-deep, 39-week consolidation in April. The stock gained 69% from that buy point until hitting resistance and pulling back to form a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in early September.


The new entry price for VEEV stock is 298.86. It cleared that buy point in good volume on Oct. 12, but has since pulled back. It's now trading below that entry.


As we wait to see if the Nasdaq can build on its Oct. 12 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), see if VEEV stock can continue to find support at its 21-day moving average and rebound in strong volume.

What goes up, must come down. But when? After a massive run-up, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) flashed several warning signs before its recent crash. See how you can use these same sell signals in Nvidia stock (and the FAANG stocks) to protect your own gains in the future when a stock tops and enters a decline.




Nvidia is not alone in seeing a bearish reversal in trend over the last two months. As the general market entered a correction, the so-called [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — all retreated. They also triggered similar [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) seen in Nvidia stock as they declined.


So if you got caught in the current market downtrend and took some losses, learn to spot these warning signs so you stay profitable and protected in future downturns.

Nvidia Stock: The Warning Signs
-------------------------------


In March 2016, Nvidia broke out of a cup with handle to [launch a 750% climb](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) in a little over two-1/2 years. Along the way, the stock formed multiple bases, but it continued to find [support at the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and remained in an overall uptrend.


But that changed in October as Nvidia stock began to pull back along with the general market. As it did that, it flashed several signals indicating it was time to reduce your exposure since the risks of a sharp decline were rising.


First, from June to August of this year, Nvidia was forming a fifth-stage base. Such later-stage consolidations are more likely to fail since a stock has already made a big run by the time they form. Establishing a new position on late-stage breakouts is a risky proposition, and Nvidia proved that point.


If you were sitting on a large gain in the stock, you may have decided to hold as Nvidia showed seesaw action following its August breakout. But if you had made a new purchase based on the 269.30 buy point, Nvidia soon triggered a [key sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) by dropping more than 8% below that entry.


In another sign of a potential change in trend, Nvidia failed to hold support at its 10-week and 50-day moving averages. These benchmarks are like a first line of defense. If large investors still favor the stock, they'll step in to pick up more shares or at least ease back on any selling as it pulls back to these lines. But Nvidia crashed right through its 10-day line on Oct. 10 in heavy volume — a sign that institutional investors were in selling, not support, mode.


The second line of defense in a sell-off is the 40-week line on the weekly chart and the equivalent 200-day line shown on the daily chart. But Nvidia failed to hold those lines as well. On Oct. 11, the stock fell below the 200-day moving average in heavy volume on Oct. 11. In the days that followed, instead of providing a floor of support, that benchmark line became a ceiling of resistance.


This was an opportunity for investors to lock in and protect at least some of the nice gains made in Nvidia in the big run-up.


Another warning sign was that the overall market was showing signs of increasing selling pressure and volatility at the same time. History shows that [when the market declines](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/affects-portfolio/), it takes three out of four stocks down with it. So the deteriorating tone of the indexes was further confirmation that it was time to take defensive action and protect your gains in Nvidia.


Since flashing those initial warning signs and sell signals, Nvidia's trend has clearly changed. Investors who heeded those warnings locked in the bulk of their gains. Those that ignored them suffered even larger losses or gave back even more of their profits as Nvidia stock continued to head south.


In further evidence of deteriorating technical health, Nvidia's shorter-term 10-week line has fallen below the longer-term 40-week moving average.


Nvidia may establish a bottom and launch a new run, but after such a sharp decline and change in trend, even if it does, it will take time to establish a new buy point.



Similar Sell Signals In FAANG Stocks
------------------------------------


As mentioned above, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet flashed similar signs of impending trouble around the same time. They all failed to find support at those two lines of defense — the 10-week and 40-week moving averages. And they've all continued to fall even lower.


While Nvidia and these FAANG stocks may very well bounce back and make strong gains in the next bull market, is it worth the risk to hold and hope that happens? A safer approach is to reduce your risk by reducing your holdings as stocks flash the sell signals discussed above. By doing that, you protect your profits, giving you the opportunity to compound those gains in the next market rally.

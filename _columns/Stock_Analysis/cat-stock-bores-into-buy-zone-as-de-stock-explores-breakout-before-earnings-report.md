CAT Stock Bores Into Buy Point After Unblocking Suez Canal
----------------------------------------------------------


When a large container ship [blocked the Suez Canal](https://www.caterpillar.com/en/news/caterpillarNews/2021/suez-canal-cat-marine.html) in March, trading through the vital waterway came to a halt, creating a backlog of over 400 vessels. Together with numerous companies, Caterpillar helped dislodge the giant vessel, one of the world's largest container ships. Named the Ever Given, it's nearly a quarter mile long and weighs 200,000 metric tons.


Founded in 1925, Caterpillar is a behemoth in its own right. With $41.7 billion in revenue in 2020, the company is the world's leader in construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives.


Focused on three primary segments — Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy & Transportation — Caterpillar does business on every continent.


On Wednesday, CAT stock drilled right up to 237.88 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). After briefly clearing that entry then retreating on Thursday, Caterpillar again drilled past that entry to close the week.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has fallen off its old highs, but is rebounding in the right direction.


DE stock is showing similar action as it explores a 392.52 buy point in a [third-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


See if the stock market indexes can continue to shake off earlier selling pressure, and CAT stock and DE stock can both excavate new buying opportunities.

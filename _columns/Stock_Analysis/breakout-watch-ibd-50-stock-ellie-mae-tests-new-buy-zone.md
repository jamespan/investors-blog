If you bought a new house or refinanced your mortgage in recent years, there's a good chance the loan was processed using the mortgage-origination services provided by **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)).


The company, which went public in 2011, provides cloud-based software that helps automate and expedite the mortgage application process, linking over 136,000 real estate professionals and lenders in its network.


Ellie Mae estimates about 25% of all residential mortgages are made on its platform.


Institutional Interest
----------------------


The company sports a 38% three-year revenue growth rate, 25.4% annual pretax profit margin and 19.2% return on equity. Ellie Mae's three-year earnings growth stands at 24%, and EPS jumped from 3% to 33% in Q2.


Although the financial-software industry group ranks a lowly No. 119 among 197 groups, Ellie Mae scores a 97 Composite Rating, earning the No. 1 ranking among its peers. **Pegasystems** ([PEGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEGA)), **Fair Isaac** ([FICO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FICO)), **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) and **Jack Henry & Associates** ([JKHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKHY)) round out the top five group leaders.


Mutual fund managers and other institutional investors have taken note, as indicated by Ellie Mae's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Poised To Pop?
--------------


The stock is working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) as part of a base-on-base formation.



Ellie Mae briefly dipped below its 10-week moving average earlier this month, but quickly climbed back above it. Also, the 10-day moving average moved back above the 50-day line on Wednesday in a sign of renewed technical strength.


Another bullish sign is how the relative strength line entered new high ground as the stock built the right side of its base.


On Thursday, Ellie Mae cleared the 102.73 buy point in volume 44% higher than normal. The potential buy zone extends to 107.87, or 5% above the entry price.

Leading Chinese internet stocks **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) have seesawed up and down after reporting earnings this week. Now industry peerÂ **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) is nearing a buy point with Q2 earnings due Aug. 22 before the market opens.









 
 
 Momo, Sina and Weibo are all in the No. 19-ranked Internet-Content group and all sport the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. Fellow industry peers **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) also share that top rating.
Triple-Digit Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------------


Momo provides a mobile social networking platform with 85.2 monthly active users as of March 2017, up from 72.3 in March 2016.


Like social media giant Facebook, Momo has proven to be exceptionally profitable, generating average EPS gains of 788% over the last three quarters.


Driven by a 32% pretax profit margin and 32% return on equity, the company's three-year annual earnings growth rate is a stellar 542%.


Analysts are looking for a 158% rise in earnings for the second quarter.


By comparison, Facebook has averaged 88% earnings growth over the last three quarters and 77% over the last three years. It has a 45% pretax profit margin and 20% ROE.


Momo has been growing revenue at an annual pace of 286% over the last three years, while Facebook has been growing its top line at a 49% clip.


Of course, Facebook dwarfs Momo in terms of revenue, generating $9.3 billion in Q2, while Momo brought in sales of $265 million in Q1.


Momo, which had its IPO in December 2014, has seen its share price basically triple since a breakout last August, but it hasn't been a smooth ride for investors. The stock formed a deep base with a 41% decline along the way.


Mutual funds and other institutional investors provide the fuel for that type of climb, and Momo has seen strong demand in recent months.


The stock has seen seven straight quarters of rising fund ownership and has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


Can Later-Stage Base Launch New Climb?
--------------------------------------


Momo is working on a third-stage cup with a 46.05 buy point. While such later-stage patterns can lead to nice gains, they're riskier since the stock has already made a big run at that point.



Also keep in mind that other leading Chinese stocks like **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), which reports Aug. 17, **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and Weibo have all made big moves in recent months, so be prepared to lock in profits if Chinese stocks begin to fall out of favor.


That said, if Momo can post another strong quarter and fund managers continue to show interest in internet stocks, especially Chinese internet stocks, it may be able to keep climbing.


One potentially bullish sign is Momo's relative strength line, which was near new high ground ahead of potential breakout.


The stock closed Wednesday's session at 45.35, 1% below the entry that it has been trying to clear over the last week. Momo was moving lower in early trade Thursday.

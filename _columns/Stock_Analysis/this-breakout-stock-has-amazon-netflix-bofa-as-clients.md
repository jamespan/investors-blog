What do **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) have in common? They all use cloud-based human-resources and payroll solutions from **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)).


 [Workday's impressive list of clients](https://www.workday.com/en-us/customers.html#?q=) doesn't stop there, with **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)), **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) and even Rolls-Royce also using the HR and procurement software it provides for a wide range of industries, including communications, health care, retail, government and financial services.


Another thing Workday has in common with Amazon and Netflix is that each stock has tried to show resilience in the face of this week's sell-off in the general market. While no stocks are immune when the [Dow Jones industrial average falls nearly 1,200 points](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-suffers-worst-point-drop-ever-but-percentage-loss-not-historic/), Amazon, Netflix and Workday have all show signs of a resilient rebound.



Triple-Digit Earnings Growth
----------------------------


Workday generated a 243% spike in earnings last quarter, and analysts expect the Silicon Valley-based company to post a 185% rise when it reports Q4 numbers on Feb. 26.


Revenue gains have been solid and steady, ranging from 32% to 43% over the last eight quarters.


On the downside, Workday has a weak annual pretax profit margin of just 1.9% and an unimpressive 2.7% return on equity.


Nonetheless, institutional investors have shown interest in the stock, as evidenced by a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership.


Testing Buy Zone
----------------


Given the volatile action in the major indexes recently, it's very risky to buy any stock right now, particularly one that is still on tap to report fourth-quarter numbers.


But Workday may be one to watch as it bounces back above the 114.98 entry it cleared on Jan. 22. The buy range extends to 120.73.


Note how despite Monday's drop, the relative strength line has continued to trend higher, a sign of market leadership.


On Tuesday, Workday sold off in the morning, but bounced back to a 1.2% gain, and was continuing to move higher in early trade Wednesday. Amazon and Netflix have show similar action.



Whatever the indexes do from here, continue to track stocks like Amazon, Netflix and Workday that have solid fundamentals and are showing resilience in the face of a sharp sell-off.

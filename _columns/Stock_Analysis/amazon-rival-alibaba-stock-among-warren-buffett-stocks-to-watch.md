One key for building your list of stocks to watch is to keep an eye on where these top-rated companies appear. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) deserves a look since it's on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), and the [Warren Buffett screen](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks-investment-strategy/) in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Alibaba stock also made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-lead-apple-netflix-microsoft-google-coronavirus-stock-market-rebound-attempt/). Several leading funds have a position in Alibaba, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) and MFS Growth ([MFEGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFEGX)). In fact, an impressive 301 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant.


The Warren Buffett screen in MarketSmith looks for stocks of companies like Alibaba that share elements of the Oracle of Omaha's investing strategy. Other names that join Alibaba stock on the screen include **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


Alibaba was featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) on March 10, while Qualys stock was highlighted on April 8.

Alibaba Stock Looks To Lead In Coronavirus Rebound
--------------------------------------------------


Time will tell if the April 2 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/)Â continues to spark a sustained new uptrend from the [coronavirus stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) crash. For now, the rally appears to be picking up speed as the Nasdaq retakes its 50-day moving average and the S&P 500 tries to follow suit.


Alibaba stock has also retaken its 50-day benchmark as it continues to consolidate and close in on a 231.24 entry. It remains just below a new all-time high. The relative strength line is also just shy of new-high ground.


On Friday, Alibaba stock slipped 1.5%, but remains above its 50-day line moving average. The stock closed up nearly 7% for the week.


Like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Alibaba stock has weathered the coronavirus pandemic well. Amazon has broken out to a new all-time high and shares the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) with Alibaba. Both Alibaba stock and Amazon stock are in the No. 2-ranked internet retail industry group.


See if Alibaba can follow Amazon's lead and move into a new buy zone in heavy volume.

When the market is in a correction, look for stocks that are showing resilience and long-term institutional demand. Design and analytics software leader **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) fits that bill.









 
 
 While Adobe's Accumulation/Distribution Rating (C+) and up/down volume ratio (1.0) slipped as the stock pulled back during last week's market sell-off, there are still clear signs of demand among leading portfolio managers.
The number of funds with a position in Adobe has increased for eight consecutive quarters. Plus, 273 funds with an A+ rating own shares in the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), MFS Growth ([MFEGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFEGX)) and Fidelity OTC ([FOCPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCPX)).


Along with Microsoft, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and others, Adobe has become [a leader among artificial intelligence (AI) stocks](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/are-hot-ai-stocks-such-as-microsoft-adobe-on-your-radar/). The company now offers [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html), a technology platform it says "uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help you discover hidden opportunities, make tedious processes fast, and offer relevant experiences to every customer."


No. 1 Stock In Highly Ranked Industry
-------------------------------------


Adobe shares the No. 1 spot within the Computer Software-Desktop industry group with the open-source software leader and fellow IBD 50 member **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)).


Both stocks have the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, meaning they're outperforming 99% of all publicly traded companies in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). Software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) holds the No. 3 ranking within the group with an 89 Composite Rating.


The industry group ranks No. 32 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Adobe continues to deliver the type of strong and steady earnings and sales growth fund managers like to see.


The San Jose, Calif.-based leader in cloud-based software has generated EPS growth ranging from 39% to 50% over the last eight quarters, while revenue gains have come between 20% and 27% during the same period.


Adobe's 37.5% annual pretax profit margin and 27.2% return on equity have been key factors in driving and sustaining that growth.


The maker of Photoshop, Illustrator and other popular creative software is expected to have its next quarterly earnings report on March 15.


Back In Buy Zone
----------------


While buying any stock during a market correction is a risky proposition, tracking stocks showing market leadership and resilience is a good way to build your watch list for the next uptrend.


Adobe initially cleared a 186.37 buy point on Jan. 9 and continued to rise until the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq began running into selling pressure.



Adobe did slip below the entry, but managed to find support at its 50-day line and quickly bounce back into buy range, which extends to 195.69.


Also note how the relative strength line remains near new high ground, a sign of continued market leadership.


On Monday, Adobe and Red Hat were both up around 2%. Microsoft was up just over 1% and also in a buy zone after finding support at its 50-day line.


Heading into the final minutes of trading Tuesday, Adobe was up nearly 1%, putting it 4% above the buy point. Microsoft was also 4% above its 86.30 entry with a gain of 0.5%, and Red Hat was retesting the 131.03 buy point it initially cleared on Jan. 25.

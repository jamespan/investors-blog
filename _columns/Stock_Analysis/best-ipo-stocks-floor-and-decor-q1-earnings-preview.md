With Q1 earnings season just around the corner, big-name stocks like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) made IBD's list of [companies expecting 50%-plus EPS growth](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/q1-earnings-preview-netflix-twitter-salesforce-baidu/). And they are joined by one of the [best IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) of 2017, **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)).




Floor & Decor has also earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), along with two other stocks also expecting over 50% earnings growth in the first quarter: [leading Chinese internet stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) Baozun ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) and fellow 2017 IPO **Smart Global Holdings** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)), which provides specialty memory and data storage solutions.


While Baozun, Netflix and Abiomed have now climbed out of buy range from their most recent breakouts, Floor & Decor has just broken out into a new buy zone.


Smart Global initially retreated from last week's breakout to fall back below the 43.26 buy point Monday as the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average sold off. But the Newark, Calif.-based stock has since rebounded and has now climbed beyond buy range. Note that Smart Global is set to report earnings March 22, with analysts expecting a whopping 1,309% increase in EPS growth.


Baidu, which has been working on a rather sloppy consolidation, has also pulled back, but is still above its 50-day line.

Amazon-Resistant Retailer
-------------------------


As a seller of hard-surface flooring and related accessories in 83 warehouse-format locations, Floor & Decor has so far proved to be one of the few **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN))-resistant retailers.


The Georgia-based company has posted revenue growth ranging from 25% to 40% over the last eight quarters, including a [sales and earnings beat in Q4](https://www.investors.com/news/floor-decor-earnings-jump-revenue-tops-for-4th-straight-quarter/). Earnings-per-share gains have come in between 31% and 75% over the last four reports.


Analysts are looking for 64% earnings growth for the current quarter.


Boosted by its track record of strong fundamentals and a 24.5% return on equity, Floor & Decor earns a 98 Composite Rating, tying it with **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)) for the No. 1 ranking among building products retailers and wholesalers.


Floor Of Support Or Ceiling Of Resistance?
------------------------------------------


In addition to Floor & Decor's fundamentals appearing to be Amazon-resistant, the stock's chart action also proved resistant to recent selling pressure in the general market.


On Tuesday, Floor & Decor jumped over 5% in volume 123% above average, pushing it past a 48.77 buy point. In early trading Wednesday, the stock is 4% above the entry, leaving it still just within buy range.


In addition to yesterday's big spike in volume, the stock has shown other positive signs of strong institutional demand, including a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.6 up/down volume ratio.


Since the company's IPO last April, 224 mutual funds have taken a position in the stock, including **T. Rowe Price New Horizons** ([PRNHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHW)), which has an A+ rating and made [IBD's latest list of Best Mutual Fund Awards](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/).

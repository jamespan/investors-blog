Autohome, a top Chinese Internet company that provides online content for car buyers, is trying to zoom in on a new buy point ahead of its Q1 earnings. **Autohome**'s ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) Internet content industry group, which includes **Autobytel** ([ABTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABTL)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and fellow Chinese stock **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), ranked in Friday's IBD a lowly No. 124 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.

  

But Autohome has been showing strength, earning "Best in Group" scores for its [Composite, EPS and SMR Ratings](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771), and a spot on IBD's Sector Leaders screen.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has come in between 64% and 100% in the latest seven reports. Earnings growth has also been impressive, surging last quarter to 81%.

  

As IBD's [Sector Leaders Review](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/042115-748868-akorn-seen-posting-triple-digit-growth.htm) noted, strong demand for Autohome's dealer subscriptions and advertising has been driving growth, and Q1 profit is expected to double when the company reports in May.

  

Autohome has a 96 Composite Rating, and institutional demand for the stock is reflected in the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.5 up/down volume ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since its December 2013 [initial public offering](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm), Autohome stock has tended to zoom up, then stall out and fall back into a new base. It may end up doing so again, but there are some [positive signs that you like to see in a base](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/673438-how-to-use-a-base-checklist.aspx).

  

The stock recaptured its 10-week line last month and has generally been closing near the top of the price range on good volume while building the right side of the pattern. Also, its Relative Strength line has been trending sharply higher.

  

Its buy point is 53.66, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

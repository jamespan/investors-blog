As future big winners **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Square** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) have shown, it often takes time for an IPO stock to find its footing and climb higher. Now specialty retail stock and 2017 IPO **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) may be another case in point as it lays the foundation for a potential new breakout move.




To varying degrees, the [IPOs for Alibaba, Square and Facebook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-dropbox-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/) got off to a rocky start. Facebook and Square both took about 14 months from their market debuts before they launched what turned into exceptional runs.


Putting aside a short-lived 20% gain from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) just after it went public in 2014, Alibaba struggled for about 2-1/2 years before kicking off a solid climb in March of last year.


Like Alibaba, Floor & Decor showed strength soon after its April 2017 IPO. While it's generally remained in an overall uptrend since then, it's been a rocky ride for investors.


Will Floor & Decor's new base become a launchpad for a stronger and more sustained uptrend?

No. 1-Ranked Retail IPO Stock
-----------------------------


Floor & Décor has already earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) screen and the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


First featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/2017-ipo-stock-floor-decor-expecting-260-growth-in-q2-nears-breakout/) on June 15, 2017, Floor & Decor is a specialty retailer of hard surface flooring and related accessories. It operates 84 warehouse-format stores, with an average size of approximately 73,000 square feet.


Floor & Decor has a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), earning it the No. 1 ranking among building products-related retail stocks. Fellow big-box retailer **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) holds the No. 5 spot with a 91 Composite Rating.


In Q1, Floor & Decor posted a 100% spike in earnings, bringing its average EPS growth over the last three quarters to 63%. Its three-year average annual earnings growth stands at 70%.


Boosted by average annual revenue growth of 33% and a 24.6% return on equity, the company earns an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/) of A. The proprietary SMR Rating tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE.


Support, Resistance, Breakout?
------------------------------


The concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts is quite simple. And just like with Alibaba, Facebook and Square, Floor & Decor's recent stock action is showing how these chart patterns work in practice.



Floor & Decor most recently hit resistance at 58.28 on the week ended April 6. As it pulled back from there in heavy volume, it failed to find support at its 10-week moving average. But it did find support at its second line of defense — the 40-week line.


The bottom or floor of the base began to form along that line. Earlier this month, the stock managed to get back above its 10-week moving average while continuing to build the right side of its base.


The next test for Floor & Decor is its old area of resistance at 58.28. If it can clear that price in heavy volume, it could mean it's turning that former [ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


To help make sure the stock is actually punching through that ceiling and not just bumping its head, we add 10 cents to the prior area of resistance in order to establish the buy point. So for Floor & Decor, the ideal entry is 58.38.


See if the stock can jump through that price on volume at least 40% higher than normal on the day of the breakout.


In morning trading Tuesday, Floor & Decor was down over 2% as the general market ran into selling pressure on continued [fears of a trade war](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-loses-400-points-trade-war-boeing-caterpillar/). Volume was trending well below average. See if Floor & Decor can bounce back enough to close the session above the 10-day moving average.

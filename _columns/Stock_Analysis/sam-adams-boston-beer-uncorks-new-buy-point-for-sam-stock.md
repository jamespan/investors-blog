Many [top money managers](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-growth-stocks-pins-schw-pypl-etsy/) have gotten in on the festivities, lifting Boston Beer's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) to B+, indicating strong [institutional buying](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) over the last 13 weeks.

Sam Adams Leads Charge Among Beer And Liquor Stocks
---------------------------------------------------


From its flagship Samuel Adams Boston Lager to Angry Orchard Hard Cider, Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea, Boston Beer offers a wide range of beers and other adult beverages.


SAM stock dominates the alcoholic beverages industry group with a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), meaning it's outperforming 98% of all stocks on the market in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). Next closest within the group is **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), which has a 75 rating in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Including its 142% earnings growth in Q4, Boston Beer has untapped average EPS growth of 109% over the last three quarters. Analysts see strong growth down the road as well, with the 98% Q1 estimates and a projected 56% rise in 2021.


Revenue growth has also been solid. Sam Adams and other brands helped generate 53% sales growth last quarter and average annual revenue gains of 26% over the last three years.


That solid fundamental performance has earned SAM stock an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


SAM Stock Uncorks New Buy Point
-------------------------------


After rising 178% from a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/) in late April of 2020, SAM stock pulled back to begin forming a second-stage cup-shape [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) taking aim at a new high, SAM stock is now testing a new 1,236.67 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Boston Beer had earlier cleared a trend line that gave the stock an aggressive entry. The current base and buy point may be easier to see with the weekly chart.


Industry peer STZ stock is also trying to break out of a base.


Look for Boston Beer to punch through the new buy point in volume at least 40% above average. SAM stock pulled back to end the short week Thursday, closing 4% shy of the new entry.

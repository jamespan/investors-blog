Like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which initially lagged in the shift from desktop to mobile computing, online payment pioneer **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) also struggled with the transition to smartphones and tablets. But that’s changing.


As Fortune reported, mobile payments and money transfers now account for approximately 25% of PayPal’s digital wallet transactions.


PayPal’s free Venmo payment app, acquired through its $800 million buyout of Braintree in 2013, is also a pivotal part of its move to mobile -- and its ongoing battle for online-payments market share with Apple Pay from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), Android Pay from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and other rivals.


Venmo has shown explosive growth, with users transferring $1 billion through the app in January, more than double the volume in January 2015 and more than a tenfold increase over January 2014.


Venmo is particularly popular among millennials (18-34 year olds), a key demographic that is more than twice as likely to shop online than the general population, according to [PayPal’s research](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/mktg/pages/stories/pdf/paypal-insights-2015-global-report-millennials.pdf).


New Growth From 'New Money'?
----------------------------


PayPal’s current ad campaign contrasts “New Money vs. Old Money,” and the company’s five-year 38% annual EPS growth rate reveals a solid track record of cashing in on digital payments.


But PayPal’s three-year growth rate is a more tepid 16%. Analysts expect earnings to rise 15% this year, followed by an 18% rise in 2017.


Although the stock’s current Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a lowly D-, over 1,700 funds have bought shares of PayPal, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).


Will PayPal’s IPO Base Pay Off?
-------------------------------


PayPal[![ISApypl022216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ISApypl022216-300x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ISApypl022216.jpg) is working on its first base, with a 42.65 entry. Trading has been wide and loose, but the relative strength line continues to hover near new high ground.


See if trading tightens up and PayPal can show signs of accumulation as it builds the right side of its base.

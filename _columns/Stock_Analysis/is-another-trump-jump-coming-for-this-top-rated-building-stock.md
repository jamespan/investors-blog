After getting a big boost from Donald Trump's surprise win, building materials provider **NCI Building Systems** ([NCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCS)) has just cleared a new buy point with earnings due after Thursday's market close.


The president-elect's plan to spend heavily on infrastructure has had building sector stocks like **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)), **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)), **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) and NCI heading higher.


Trump's victory has also [lifted major steel companies](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/steel-stocks-surge-on-trump-but-will-idle-plants-reboot/), including **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)).


Leading Stock In Leading Industry Group
---------------------------------------


As noted in the [Mar. 29 IBD Stock Analysis on Vulcan Materials](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/this-stock-may-rock-regardless-of-who-wins-2016-election/), construction and building materials stocks were already getting a boost from a $305 billion highway bill signed by President Obama last December.


Trump's pitch to spend $1 trillion to upgrade the nation's roads, bridges and airports has given an additional boost to the top-rated metal processing stocks, including NCI Building Systems, **Barnes Group** ([B](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=B)), **Insteel Industries** ([IIIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIIN)), **Worthington Industries** ([WOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOR)) and **Schnitzer Steel Industries** ([SCHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHN)).


The Metal Processing & Fabrication industry group ranks No. 7 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, and NCI Building Systems' 92 Composite Rating earns it the No. 4 ranking among its peers.


Through a family of companies, NCI operates across three integrated business segments for the nonresidential building industry: metal coatings, metal components and engineered building systems.


It's one of the largest makers of metal products in North America, and also has operations in China.


Triple-Digit Earnings Growth To Be Tested
-----------------------------------------


NCI Building Systems has posted three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth and sports a 155% three-year annual EPS growth rate.


Sales growth has been more tepid, but still respectable with average annual revenue growth of 10% over the last three years.


All that gets put to the test after Thursday's market close, when the Houston-based company reports its performance for fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, ended Oct. 30.


Breaking Out From Imperfect Base
--------------------------------


After a sharp sell-off that pushed the stock below its 10-week moving average following its fiscal Q3 earnings report on Aug. 30, NCI ended up spending the next 10 weeks under that benchmark line.


While the stock generally traded within a tight range during that time, living under the 10-week line for that much of the base can be a yellow flag.



But since the election, NCI Building Systems has built the right side of its second-stage cup-with-handle. On Thursday, the stock jumped into a 17.75 to 18.64 buy zone in above average volume.


Keep in mind, however, that it's risky to buy a stock just before an earnings announcement.


***Update***


NCI Building Systems posted EPS growth of -10% for fourth quarter fiscal 2016. In early trading Friday, the stock gapped down sharply – confirming why it's risky to buy a stock just before the company reports. Sales grew 4% for the the quarter.

Focused on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the Bakken Basin, **Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)) has oil running through its Houston, Texas-based veins. While drilling horizontally primarily in the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks zones, OAS stock has been rising sharply since returning to the public markets in November 2020 following a [financial restructuring](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oasis-petroleum-successfully-completes-financial-restructuring-301177693.html).




The company says it is "intensely focused" on generating free cash flow. In 2020, Oasis Petroleum pumped out $57.52 in cash flow per share while generating $40.55 earnings per share. It pays a dividend, currently yielding 1.6% on an annualized basis.


Established in 2007, Oasis Petroleum soared after starting to trade again less than a year ago, rising sharply in its first week of trading. From the close of its first week until hitting resistance in early July of this year, OAS stock rose 247%.


The [oil and natural gas](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) producer is now exploring a new potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

Oasis Petroleum Has Big Growth In The Pipeline
----------------------------------------------


In Q1, Oasis Petroleum posted a 1,100% spike in earnings growth. Including three quarters based on comparisons to prior years that showed a loss, the company has now posted five quarters of explosive, triple-digit gains. Analysts expect the company to pump out another 827% EPS spike in the third quarter.


The establishment of true profitability remains a work in progress, with full-year estimates calling for a 70% slowdown in 2021. But estimates have been revised higher for both this year and next. Analysts see Oasis Petroleum posting 51% earnings growth in 2022.


Meanwhile, revenue has begun to accelerate. Last quarter, the company delivered a 136% spike in sales, up from an 8% decline in the prior report.


Oasis Petroleum pays a dividend currently yielding 1.6% on an annualized basis.


OAS Stock Explores First-Stage Base
-----------------------------------


Despite its big run since November, Oasis Petroleum's current [cup-shape pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) is considered a [first-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) 107.75.


Such consolidations can offer a healthy chance for the stock to regroup and reset for a continued climb. But in this case, that's misleading because you can't ignore the fact the stock has more than doubled from its first close on Nov. 20.


OAS stock has climbed back above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) as its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) trends higher.


Signaling demand, Oasis Petroleum has a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/). The number of funds that own OAS stock jumped from 197 to 294 last quarter.


On Friday, Oasis Petroleum came off its close to close the 10% below the buy point. The stock marked its fourth straight up week with more than a 4% gain for the week.

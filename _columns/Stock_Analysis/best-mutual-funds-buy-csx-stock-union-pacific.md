CSX Stock No. 1 Among Railroad Stocks
-------------------------------------


With a 98 Composite Rating, CSX holds the No. 1 ranking among its railroad industry peers. **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)), Union Pacific, **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) and **Canadian National Railway** ([CNI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNI)) round out the top five. The railroad group itself ranks No. 16 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.


CSX has posted three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth and two quarters of rising revenue gains. Earnings-per-share growth has gone from 6% in Q3 of 2017 to 58% in the second quarter of this year. With analysts looking for that trend to continue with an 80% rise in third quarter, CSX earned a spot on the list of [stocks expecting 50%-plus EPS growth in Q3](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-analyst-estimates-eps-growth/).


CSX is set to report third-quarter earnings after the market close on Oct. 16.


Earnings estimates for the full year (58%) and for 2019 (12%) were recently revised higher.


The Florida-based railroad pays a [dividend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2531707), currently yielding 1.2% on an annualized basis.


The number of funds with a position in CSX has risen in each of the last two quarters, jumping from 1,689 in Q2 to 1,733 in the third quarter.


CSX Stock Near Breakout
-----------------------


CSX is testing support at its 50-day line as it builds a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 76.34 buy point. Its relative strength line continues to float near a new 52-week high.


On Monday, the stock found support at the 50-day moving average and managed recoup morning losses and close in positive territory with a 0.4% gain. In early trading Tuesday, CSX is edging slightly higher, putting it 2% below the entry.


But note that the [current market outlook](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/) is "uptrend under pressure," meaning it's a time to proceed with caution and be careful about making any new buys. So see if the indexes can shake off the current selling pressure and rebound into a renewed rally.



Union Pacific has also shown resilience amid the current market turbulence. The stock continues to trade in a tight range, holding on to the gains it made after gapping up more than 4% on Sept. 18. Like CSX, it recovered from an earlier slip to end the day higher. It's continuing to show tight trading early Tuesday.


Norfolk Southern also has continued to chug along in tight trading, staying nicely above its 50-day, 10-day and 21-day moving averages.

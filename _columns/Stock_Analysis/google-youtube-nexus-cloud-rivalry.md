Google may have started as a search engine, but today it's doing battle across a wide range of industries. 

  

**Smartphones:** While the focus last week was on the upcoming **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone 6S, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is getting ready to roll out two new Nexus smartphones.

  

According to International Data, in Q2 Google's Android operating system powered 82.8% of the worldwide smartphone market, vs. 13.9% for Apple's iOS.

  

**Online Video:** Google-owned YouTube showed its fastest viewership growth in two years last quarter, but it's facing rising competition from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which drives more of the social engagement that advertisers want.

  

**Cloud Computing:** Gartner's 2014 annual report on the cloud infrastructure services market shows **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Web Services as the clear leader, but Google, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) round out the Big 4, which together commanded 54% market share last year.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

On July 16, Google smashed Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS growth rising from 5% in Q1 to 17%. Since then, the stock's Composite Rating has soared from 67 to 98, earning the stock [a spot on the IBD 50](http://news.investors.com/technology/090815-769985-google-leads-tech-stocks-ibd-50-this-week.htm).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Prior to the Q2 report, Google had been forming a long consolidation, showing many weeks of extremely tight trading.

  

It bolted out of that range the day after reporting, finishing the week up more than 25%.

  

Although the stock gave back a large chunk of those gains as the market sold off, it found support at the 10-week moving average and is now working on an early-stage consolidation.

  

While the nascent uptrend that began on Sept. 8 has already shown signs of trouble, see if Google can find support and move higher if the market rally does gain traction.

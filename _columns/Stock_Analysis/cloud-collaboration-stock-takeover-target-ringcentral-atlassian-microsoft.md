As the global leader in cloud-based communication and collaboration solutions for businesses and other enterprises, **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) has no shortage of rivals, including **Vonage** ([VG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VG)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and [IBD 50 member](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).









 
 
 RingCentral was recently named the [No. 1 cloud communications solution provider](https://www.ringcentral.com/whyringcentral/company/pressreleases/pressreleases-2017/ringcentral-ranked--1-cloud-communications-solution-provider--ac.html) by Synergy Research, which said RingCentral's roster of more than 350,000 client organizations makes it the worldwide market-share leader in both revenue and subscriber seats for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS).
Focused on driving the seamless integration of telephony, videoconferencing, messaging and fax across mobile and other devices, RingCentral's platform integrates with leading productivity applications from **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Box** ([BOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOX)) and **Zendesk** ([ZEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZEN)), as well as with Microsoft Outlook and Google For Work from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


In early August, Bloomberg reported that RingCentral, which has a $3.2 billion market capitalization, [may be a takeover target](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/fast-growing-enterprise-software-name-rises-on-takeover-chatter/) of private-equity interests or rival cloud-based software providers. RingCentral reportedly hired an advisor in response to the news.


166% Earnings Growth
--------------------


RingCentral has been growing earnings at an average annual rate of 166% over the last three years. The company posted a 100% spike in EPS last quarter, and consensus analyst estimates for Q3 call for a 33% gain.


Sales growth has averaged 32% over the last three years, with quarterly revenue gains ranging from 25% to 35% across the last eight reports.


With a 98 Composite Rating, RingCentral shares the No. 2 slot in the enterprise software industry group with **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)), and **Salesforce.com** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and IBD 50 member **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) are tied for the top spot with the highest possible 99 rating.


The fundamental and technical strength of these leading stocks has helped earn the group the No. 27 ranking among the 197 groups IBD tracks, and Paycom, **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), LogMeIn and RingCentral are all in or near a potential buy zone. [ServiceNow](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-margins-getting-better-as-it-gets-bigger-analyst/)Â and Salesforce.com are both trading at the upper end of a buy zone following an earlier breakout.


Ringing In A New Breakout?
--------------------------


RingCentral bolted past a 39.10 buy point on Aug. 9 in reaction to the takeover news. But it gave back much of those gains and closed the day just below the entry.


Since then, the stock found support along its 10-day moving average while working on a new second-stage flat base with a 43.15 buy point. Over the last few days, the stock has slipped back below the 10-day line, so look for it to retake that benchmark.


The relative strength line is not far off new high ground, and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership show demand for the stock.


Tuesday was quiet for RingCentral, as it was down fractionally in light trade, ending the day 4% below the buy point.


See if RingCentral can punch through the entry in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

We've talked about the "N" in CAN SLIM before and as you may remember it stands for the new thing that sets a company apart from the competition.

  

It might be a new product or a new CEO or the case of **Health Insurance Innovations**  ([HIIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIIQ)) it's something new in the industry, due to regulatory changes brought on by Pres. Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act.

  

Health Insurance Innovations is an online insurance company that connects insurance carriers, brokers, agents and consumers to its portfolio of health-insurance related products.

  

As an April 4 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/040313-650249-health-insurance-innovations-stock-price-rallies.htm) noted, the firm specializes in 12-month Short-Term Medical plans, also called STMs, that are an alternative to traditional plans that provide long-term renewable coverage. Its target market is people who are currently don't have health insurance or who are under insured.

  

STMs are expected to grow in popularity under [ObamaCare](http://news.investors.com/politics/obamacare.htm) because they're cheaper than comprehensive medical plans, but offer many of the same types of benefits and coverage.

  

In general, STMs are easier to qualify for than major medical insurance plans. The downside is they're not as comprehensive because they typically don't cover prescription drugs or preventative care. But they do give healthy people a way to protect against major claims at a fraction of the cost of other types of insurance.

  

And those lower costs are expected to be a big selling point for STMs in a changing regulatory environment.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• And judging by HIIQ's sales growth, which accelerated to 46% last quarter, they're fairly popular.

  

• Earnings grew 25% last quarter, which was slower than the previous quarter, but still meets the minimum pace of growth typically seen in winning stocks.

  

• Analysts see earnings rising 152% this year and 110% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-health-ins-innovations-a-hiiq.aspx) shows Health Insurance Innovations has the fifth highest Composite Rating in its Insurance-Brokers industry group.

  

**Brown & Brown**  ([BRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRO)) carries the group's highest rating. But its sales and earnings track record and its forecast aren't as strong as Health Insurance Innovations'.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 127 among IBD's 197 groups. So watch to see if that improves.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As the MarketSmith chart above shows, Health Insurance Innovations just came public in Feb., so it's a recent IPO. And it has yet to settle down and form its first base pattern.

  

But it may be one to watch to see if those strong earnings and sales growth numbers continue.

  

If it settles down and carves out a base pattern, then breaks out when the market is in an uptrend, it could give investors a chance to get on board.

  

Here's something else to be aware of: this stock only trades about 172,000 shares a day on average, so it's on the thin side. But it's also a young company, so watch to see if that volume improves if more big investors buy in.

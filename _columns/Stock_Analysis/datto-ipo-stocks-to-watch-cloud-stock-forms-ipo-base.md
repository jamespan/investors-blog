After going public on Oct. 21, **Datto** ([MSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSP)) has quickly become one of the leading IPO stocks to watch. The cloud-based managed service provider (MSP) broke out Friday, clearing a buy point in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).




Datto joins **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)),  **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) in the enterprise software group. The company provides clients with an ecosystem of unified continuity, networking, and business management solutions.


The concept of unified continuity focuses on integrating hardware, software and cloud infrastructure to implement comprehensive data backup and disaster recovery systems. Datto's technology enables MSPs to protect small and medium businesses against cybersecurity threats and minimize business downtime.


Datto Sees Emerging Triple-Digit EPS Growth
-------------------------------------------


Founded in 2007, Datto has more than 17,000 MSP partners and serves over one million customers. Headquartered in Connecticut, the company has more than 20 locations around the world.


Although based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss, Datto has posted two straight quarters of earnings per share (a penny in the March ended first quarter and a nickel in Q2) vs. net losses a year earlier. Quarterly sales increases have ranged from 14% to 20% over the past six reports. Datto releases Q3 numbers on Nov. 23.


Datto has an 83 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), below the 95 or higher score [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) investors typically look for in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). But that's not unusual for new IPO stocks. By comparison, fellow cloud stocks Zoom Video and Digital Turbine both have the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. ServiceNow (97) and Salesforce (96) are just behind but with very strong ratings of their own.


Datto Among Top IPO Stocks To Watch As IPO Base Forms
-----------------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) already hitting a new 52-week high, Datto has jumped past a new 32.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an IPO base.


On Friday, Datto rose more than 6%, ending the session in buy range. Datto hasn't traded long enough to establish its [50-day or 10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


Keep in mind that newer IPO stocks can be volatile. Plus, the stock market is still trying to strengthen the new uptrend it launched on Nov. 4.


See if the market indexes can build on the recent [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/), and look for Datto to deliver strong Q3 numbers. While it's risky to buy any stock right before it reports, see if Datto can continue its run of strengthening earnings on the heels of its new breakout.

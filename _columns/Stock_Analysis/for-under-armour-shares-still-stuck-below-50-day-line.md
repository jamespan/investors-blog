The chart of **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) shows a stock forming a cup-type base. Yet, the price and volume action shows weakness.

  

The maker of athletic clothing broke out of a flat base that was part of a base-on-base pattern. The April 1 breakout 1 saw the stock surge in robust volume past the 70.79 buy point. Under Armour climbed to a new high.

  

The first sign of trouble came on April 26, when the company released its quarterly results. Despite that Under Armour beat expectations and raised guidance, shares plunged to the 50-day moving average in heavy volume 2.

  

That drop was the biggest since it began its price run-up. That was a sell signal.

  

Under Armour initially found support at the 50-day line.

  

But soon the stock continued to move below the line. The stock has spent more than five weeks living under the 50-day (or 10-week) line, and has been unable to rally back. A continuation of this trend would be another reason to consider selling.

  

On the plus side, Under Armour is making a well-rounded pattern that bodes well if the stock goes on to form a proper base.

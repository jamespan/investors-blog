Ordering pizza while watching the big game just got easier and cheaper, with last month's launch of a new Apple TV app from **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)).


The world's third-largest pizza delivery company is the first national restaurant brand to develop an app for the **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) platform, allowing TV viewers to customize and order pizza and other menu items using their remote control devices.


Papa John's also automatically knocks 25% off the price of orders made through the Apple TV app.


Last month, the company also renewed its multiyear deal as the Official Pizza Sponsor of the NFL and Super Bowl.


Mexico Expansion
----------------


Kentucky-based Papa John's operates nearly 5,000 locations worldwide, including more than 1,500 stores outside the U.S.


Last week, the company announced **[expansion plans in Mexico](https://www.investors.com/news/papa-johns-nears-buy-point-plans-mexico-expansion/)**, where it will partner with Orquest Foods to build 60 restaurants in the country over the next eight years.


While the restaurants industry group ranks No. 109 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, Papa John's ranks No. 1 among its industry peers, ahead of **Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)), **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) and direct rival **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), which comes in at No. 7.


After three quarters of flat or negative sales growth, Q2 revenue rebounded to a 6% gain. Earnings jumped 30%, the third consecutive quarter of rising growth. Analyst EPS estimates for 2016 and 2017 were recently revised higher to 17% and 12%, respectively.


Baking A Breakout?
------------------


After forming the bottom of its current 61-week consolidation, Papa John's rose over 80% while building the right side of that pattern, showing tight trading and consistent support along its 10-week line.


The stock has now formed a handle with a 78.19 entry, as it relative strength line trends higher. See if Papa John's can clear the entry in heavy trading, but also keep in mind that recent market volatility makes new buys more risky.

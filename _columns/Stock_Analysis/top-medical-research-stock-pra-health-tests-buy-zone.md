When biotech companies like **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) put their drugs through extensive trials to gain FDA approval, they turn to clinical research firms like **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)).









 
 
 PRA Health is one of the world's leading global contract research organizations, and holds the No. 1 ranking within the medical research equipment and services industry group, ahead of **QuintilesIMS** ([Q](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Q)), **Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)) and **ICON** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)).
Catalent and ICON, as well as Biogen, are all up nicely from recent breakouts, but PRA Health has now just entered a new buy zone. Quintiles was up 1.4% Friday, putting it just pennies below a 100.05 buy point. Meanwhile, ICON is now forming a new base.


Strong EPS Growth, Institutional Demand
---------------------------------------


Based in Raleigh, N.C., PRA Health has over 70 offices and more than 14,000 employees around the world. It sports a 58% three-year annual EPS growth rate and saw earnings gains jump from 13% to 25% in Q2. Sales growth also rose, from 13% to 17%. Q3 earnings are on tap for Oct. 25, with analysts expecting a 32% rise.


Signs of demand for shares include an A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rating-detects-institutional-buying-and-selling-in-stock/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


In August, the company announced it was [acquiring Symphony Health Solutions](http://investor.prahs.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253891&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2292321), a provider of cloud-based analytics for the biopharmaceutical industry.


New Breakout On Trial
---------------------


After rising more than 6% Aug. 8 on Q2 earnings, PRA Health's stock came back down the next day, but found support, formed a base and just cleared a new 81.09 entry on Monday.  The buy zone extends to 85.14.


Volume on the day of the breakout was just 10% above average, well below the 40% or higher spike you like to see. Also note that the pattern being formed is the riskier, third-stage variety.


But the relative strength line is near new high ground and the 10-day moving average has moved sharply back above the longer-term 50-day line — both signs of technical strength.


Look for heavier upside volume to kick in, and keep an eye out for PRA Health's Q3 earnings report on Oct. 25.


On Friday, the stock was up just under 1% in quiet volume, putting it 1% above the buy point.

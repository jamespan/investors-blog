While industry leaders like **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) are struggling to take flight, Brazil's **Azul** ([AZUL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZUL)) has been testing a new buy zone.









 
 
 United nose-dived more than 11% on Jan. 24 after reporting earnings, then skidded below its 200-day moving average the next day. The Chicago-based flier remains under that benchmark line, and the 50-day line is still below its longer-term cousin.
Southwest has retreated from a December breakout and is now below its 10-week moving average and the 59.99 buy point, while American Airlines is also below the entry it cleared earlier this month.


Meanwhile, Azul, which has 792 daily flights to more than 100 locations and was ranked as [the most on-time airline in the Americas in 2017](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/azul-reports-december-traffic-203000962.html), is trying to push through turbulence in the general market and retake the buy point it initially cleared on Jan. 31.


Is Rising EPS Growth Sustainable?
---------------------------------


Azul delivered a whopping 5,600% spike in earnings in Q3, and analysts expect a 520% increase when the Brazilian airline releases Q4 numbers. The company has not yet announced a reporting date.


Founded in 2008, Azul has reported triple-digit or better EPS growth in four of the last five quarters, but three of those are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed a loss.


Sales growth has ranged from 15% to 32% over the last five reports, including an increase to 18% in Q3.


Signs of institutional demand for Azul include an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.9 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Taking Flight From New Base?
----------------------------


Since going public last April, Azul has formed two bases. The stock has shown good signs of accumulation while building the right side of its current pattern, and the relative strength line has been moving sharply higher.



Another sign of renewed technical strength is how the 10-day and 21-day lines recently moved back above the longer-term 50-day moving average.


Early Wednesday, Azul gapped up to clear the 29.53 entry, but fell back to fill that gap and close the day below the buy point. Volume was 32% above average. Note that while the relative strength line has been rising, it was still below new high ground at the time of the breakout.


On Thursday, the stock again flew into buy range, but reduced altitude in the afternoon to close pennies below the buy point.Â As selling pressure in the indexes continued Friday, Azul gapped down sharply, pushing it 2% below the entry. But note how the stock found support at and bounced off its 10-day moving average.


Keep in mind three key points.


First, newer [IPO stocks can be volatile](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/) so be sure to keep them on a tight leash.


Second, it can be risky to buy stocks just before they report and it's not yet clear when Azul will release its latest numbers.


Finally, [keep a close eye on the general market](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), which has been showing signs of potential topping action in recent days.

Clinical Research Firms Among Top Stocks To Watch
-------------------------------------------------


PRA Health Sciences provides clinical research and development services to the [biotech and pharmaceutical industries](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/). Based in Raleigh, N.C., the company is a full-service global contract research organization (CRO) providing clinical trial management, statistical analysis and drug development consulting.


With over 70 offices and nearly 16,000 employees around the world, PRA has participated in approximately 3,700 clinical trials. It's played a pivotal or supporting role in trials that have led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory agencies' approval for over 75 drugs.


On Nov. 27, the company announced the launch of its [Pediatric Site Network](http://investors.prahs.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253891&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2378368), a group of pediatric research centers around the world.


PRA Health Sciences has a track record of solid earnings and sales growth. Over the last four quarters, earnings growth has ranged from 27% to 46%. Revenue gains have come in between 23% and 44% during the same period. Analysts expect full-year EPS growth of 28%, followed by a 16% gain in 2019. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Signs of institutional demand include an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.2 up/down volume ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


New Buy Point On Trial For PRA Health Sciences
----------------------------------------------


PRA Health Sciences has been climbing steadily higher since its IPO in November 2014. It was last featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-medical-research-stock-pra-health-tests-buy-zone/) in October 2017 as it was clearing an 81.09 buy point.


The company has just cleared a 112.98 buy point from a new consolidation. It's considered a first-stage base since it undercut the August low in its prior chart pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


One telltale clue for finding stocks to watch during a market correction is to [check the relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). During the recent downturn, PRA's RS line bucked the market trend and hit a new 52-week high ahead of a possible breakout — a bullish sign of market leadership.


The market outlook changed to "[confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)" on Nov. 28, and PRA broke out the next day.


The stock rose 6.1% Wednesday in volume 50% above average. It then cleared the buy point on Thursday in even heavier trade. On Friday, PRA Health Sciences again added to those gains with a 2.5% gain to close at 116.74. Preliminary volume was 224% above average. The buy range extends to 118.63.

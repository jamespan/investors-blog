Moelis Eyes New Breakout After 48% Gain Since December
------------------------------------------------------


Not only does Moelis qualify as one of the best dividend stocks to buy and watch, the stock's price performance has also been strong since rebounding from a sharp correction beginning in June 2018.


From a breakout in last December, Moelis ran up as much as 48% before pulling back to form its current [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The buy point is 57.


Moelis came right up the buy point Friday, but fell just short of breaking out. Volume came in below average.


The relative strength line slipped while forming that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), but is starting to trend higher.


See if Moelis can bankroll a new breakout in volume at least 40% above average.

Maybe it's the anti-aging cream, but top-rated retail stock Ulta Beauty is poised to keep growing in 2015.

  

As [The New America column](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/011315-734499-ulta-beauty-turns-heads-with-growth-prospects.htm) noted recently, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is strong. It has 765 locations in 47 states and plans on opening about 100 new stores a year for the next five years.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

As a one-stop shop for beauty care products with a popular loyalty program, Ulta has produced 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Revenue gains have also been solid and steady, with just one quarter under 20% in the last 16 reports.

  

Ulta's 23% return on equity and 28% 3-year annual EPS growth rate help it earn a 99 IBD Composite Rating, the highest rating possible.

  

The number of funds with a position in the stock has been on the rise in recent quarters. And Ulta made IBD's most recent list of [New Buys of Top-Performing Stock Funds for Past Three Months](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/010615-733523-top-stock-funds-buy-illumina.htm).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

When we last featured [Ulta Beauty in the Sept. 19 IBD Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/091914-718234-with-earnings-accelerating-is-ulta-beauty-ready-for-a-makeover-.aspx) , it was still working on a long and deep cup with handle.

  

It broke out at the end of October and inched higher for several weeks. While it has pulled back slightly to form a new flat base, the tight trading and good support along its 10-week moving average are signs of strength in the face of recent market weakness. Ulta is now testing that 10-week line again, so see if big investors continue to step in with support.

  

The ideal buy point in the base is 134.60, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

While now is not an ideal time to buy, if Ulta can hold its ground while the market's under pressure, and if the company can continue to post solid earnings and sales growth, it could become even better looking.

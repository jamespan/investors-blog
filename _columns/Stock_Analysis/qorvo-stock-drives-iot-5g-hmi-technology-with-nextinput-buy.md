Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G stock **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) may be sensing a fresh breakout. Boosted by a recent acquisition in Human- Machine Interface (HMI) technology, Qorvo stock is looking to beam into a new buy zone.




As one of the leading [semiconductor stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) to watch, Qorvo specializes in enhancing mobile connectivity through 5G networks, [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) and IoT technology. Qorvo provides innovative Radio Frequency (RF) solutions at the center of global, multi-device connectivity.


In May, [Qorvo acquired NextInput](https://www.qorvo.com/newsroom/news/2021/qorvo-acquires-leading-mems-based-sensor-solution-provider-nextinput). Based in Silicon Valley, NextInput is a pioneer in the emerging field of force-sensing solutions for HMI technology. NextInput has shipped tens of millions of MEMS-based sensors to manufacturers of smartphones, wearables, automobiles and other applications.


Standing for Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems, MEMS is a chip-based technology. Through its purchase of NextInput, Qorvo aims to accelerate the deployment of force-sensing tech utilizing MEMS-based sensors, further driving the adoption of HMI applications.


After Posting 75% Growth, What Will Qorvo Beam Up Next Quarter?
---------------------------------------------------------------


In May, Qorvo posted 75% earnings growth for [its fiscal Q4](https://ir.qorvo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/qorvor-announces-fiscal-2021-fourth-quarter-financial-results), ended April 3. Analysts expect the 5G and IoT leader to post a 63% EPS increase in the current quarter.


Last quarter, revenue rose 36%, helping Qorvo earn an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


Although Qorvo did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/googl-stock-nvidia-lead-latest-list-of-new-buys-by-the-best-mutual-funds/), [institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) like what they see, with 62 funds scoring an A+ rating from IBD reporting a position in Qorvo stock.


Qorvo Stock Touches Buy Point
-----------------------------


After pulling back from an April breakout without [resetting its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), Qorvo stock is now working on a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 199.05.


As the tech-heavy Nasdaq has run into resistance recently, Qorvo also pulled back. Weekly volume is trending well below average.


The stock remains above its [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) as its relative strength line tries to return to its old high.


See if the general [stock market trend](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/) remains positive as Qorvo stock looks to beam up a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/).

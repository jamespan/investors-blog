Driven by strong 2014 auto sales, **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) posted accelerating earnings and revenue growth in fiscal Q3 and is now trying to motor through a new flat base buy point.

  

Fellow car dealer stocks **Asbury Automotive Group** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)) and **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) [topped earnings estimates](http://news.investors.com/business/020315-737606-autonation-crushes-fourth-quarter-estimates.htm) earlier this month, so see if CarMax can do the same when it reports fourth-quarter numbers on April 2.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Carmax's third-quarter earnings beat estimates, accelerating from 13% to 28%. Revenue growth also topped views, jumping from 11% to 16%.

  

The auto dealers industry group ranks a mediocre No. 83 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks, but CarMax is a leader among its peers, earning the "Best in Group" ranking for its Relative Strength and Accumulation/Distribution Ratings. It ranks No. 2 for Composite Rating, behind **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

CarMax reset its base count in October, making the new pattern it was forming a first-stage consolidation. After breaking out later that month, the stock flashed several weeks of very tight closes, a sign institutional investors were sitting tight and likely quietly adding to their positions. CarMax offered a follow-on buying opportunity when it broke out of that price range in November.

  

The stock bolted higher Dec. 19 on its strong earnings report, gapping up to close 11% higher on volume 207% above average.

  

Like many stocks at the time, CarMax quickly got knocked back down into a new base. But it found support at its 10-week line and the decline in the base was just 11%, showing investors were not aggressively dumping shares.

  

The current formation is a second-stage flat base with a 68.81 buy point.

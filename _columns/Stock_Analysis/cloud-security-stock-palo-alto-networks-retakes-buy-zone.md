**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is among six cloud security software stocks sporting the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) share top billing with Palo Alto in the No. 2-ranked software security industry.




With over 60,000 enterprise customers, Palo Alto Networks provides cloud security services to help predict, prevent, detect and respond to security and compliance risks.


Last month, the Silicon Valley-based company announced its [intent to buy Demisto](https://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2019/Palo-Alto-Networks-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Demisto/default.aspx), a leader in the security orchestration and response (SOAR) space. Valued at $560 million in cash and stock, Palo Alto Networks says the deal will help "deliver immediate threat prevention and response for security teams."

Fellow cloud security stocks Fortinet and Proofpoint also made the list.


Over the last eight quarters, Palo Alto has reported EPS increases ranging from 33% to 67%, while revenue gains have come in at 25% to 31%. Boosted by a 22.5% annual pretax profit margin and 45.1% return on equity, the company sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE as a whole.

Palo Alto Networks Reboots With Base-Count Reset
------------------------------------------------


Palo Alto Networks stock has been rising steadily since finding a bottom in April 2017. Last September, it began building a deep cup, eventually declining as much as 33%. While building that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), the stock undercut the low in its prior consolidation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


After [reporting earnings on Feb. 26](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-earnings-panw-stock-q42018/), Palo Alto gapped up to an 8.2% gain the next day, pushing it past a 239.60 buy point. Volume was 365% higher than normal. But that was followed by four straight down days, also in above-average trade, pushing the stock back below the entry. It did not fall enough to trigger the [7%-8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/).


Since then, the cloud security leader has climbed back into buy range. But the rebound has come in tepid volume. On Wednesday, the stock gained 1.4% to 245.82 in rising, but still below-average trade. Look for heavier volume to kick in to show investor enthusiasm for the move, and see if the relative strength line can reach a new 52-week high.


On Friday, Palo Alto Networks stock gave back 3% to close at 242.30 in light volume. The stock remains within the 239.60 to 251.58 buy zone.

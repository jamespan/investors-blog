Many companies say they put their customers first. But **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) takes it a step further.

  

As a July 27 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/072613-665342-ultimate-software-payroll-administration-adp.htm) noted, they set an example by treating their employees like customers. They believe that if employees are satisfied, they provide better customer service.

  

So they do things like cover 100% of their health care costs. They're also very good at screening and finding promising new hires.

  

[Ultimate](http://www.ultimatesoftware.com/) provides web-based payroll and human resources services. And they win more than 90% of competitive deals against major payroll service providers like ADP, when they run through their sales process.

  

Also, rather than focusing on smaller companies, they focus on those with 200 or more employees.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Earnings growth has been strong in recent quarters, coming in most recently at 146%.

  

• Sales growth ranged from 22% to 27% during the past four quarters.

  

• The company is scheduled to post its latest quarterly results after Tuesday's close.

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings climbing 38% in 2013 and 32% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-ultimate-software-group-ulti.aspx) shows Ultimate's 98 Composite Rating is one of the best in its Computer Software -Enterprise group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 41 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith weekly chart on this page shows the stock found support at the 10-week line in late June, rebounded up from it and has been climbing since then.

  

It's now too far extended past its buying range to get into safely. But it may be worth keeping an eye on.

  

Here's something else to factor in: Ultimate only trades about 146,000 shares a day. So it's on the thin side and thin stocks can be more volatile.

HD Supply Delivers 960% Earnings Growth
---------------------------------------


On March 18, HD Supply reported earnings for its fiscal Q4 and full-year 2018, ended Feb. 3, 2019. The Atlanta-based company generated net sales of $6 billion for the full year, including $1.45 billion in Q4. Fourth-quarter EPS growth spiked 960%, while revenue grew 22%, up from 18% in the prior report.


Full-year net sales for HD Supply's Construction & Industrial business increased 29.9% to $2.96 billion in Q4. Its facilities maintenance revenue rose 8.5% to just over $3 billion.


HD Supply has over 11,000 employees serving some 500,000 customers through 270 branches and 42 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada.


While the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a middling C+, its 2.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) and five quarters of rising fund ownership point to [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) for shares.


Can HD Supply Break Through Long-Term Resistance?
-------------------------------------------------


Since the end of 2016, HD Supply stock has hit an area of [long-term resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) around 45 multiple times. It bumped its head on that ceiling again in August, and pulled back to begin forming its current chart pattern.


The new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 44.77 is again right around that area of resistance.


While the relative strength line is still below a new 52-week high, the moving averages for HD Supply have flashed signs of rebounding technical strength. As you like to see, the shorter-term moving averages have climbed back above their longer-term cousins. The 50-day line recently retook the 200-day, and the 10-day line recently moved back above the 50-day line.


But the stock still faces that looming test of its long-term ceiling of resistance. So see if HD Supply can clear that resistance in particularly heavy volume to show conviction for a true breakout move. And look for the stock to turn that ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support to ease an upward climb.


HD Supply ended Friday's session off 0.3% in light volume at 44.30, 1% below the entry.

With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already hitting a new 52-week high, **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) continues its impressive ascent right along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Now GE stock appears poised to spring into a new buy zone — if it can withstand increased selling in the market indexes.




Featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day on Sept. 12](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ge-stock-flashes-buy-signal-after-76-percent-rally-in-2023/), the industrial powerhouse has rallied as much as 152% from the low it hit in July of last year. The strong and steady climb has lifted shares in GE stock to their highest level in five years. The sharp climb in its RS line hammers home how General Electric has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 since GE stock got dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2018.


Founded in 1892, the conglomerate remains committed to transforming into a pure aerospace play by early 2024 as part of its breakup strategy, including spinning off **GE HealthCare Technologies** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)) in January. GEHC shares have slumped since jumping out to a new high in April.


General Electric also plans to shed various assets ranging from lighting to locomotives.


Top Funds Power Into Shares Of General Electric
-----------------------------------------------


With the spinoff off GE HealthCare complete, next to set off on its own is [GE Vernova](https://www.gevernova.com/). With plans to become an independent company early next year, GE Vernova is a global energy firm that includes GE's current Power, Wind and Electrification segments. Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., GE Vernova has over 80,000 employees across more than 140 countries.


[GE Aerospace](https://www.geaerospace.com/) — sometimes called GE's "crown jewel" — will maintain the GE trademark, trading under the longtime GE ticker symbol.


Leading institutional investors have shown their approval for General Electric's plans. In addition to a B- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), 49 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in GE stock.


On July 25, the company posted earnings of 68 cents a share, an 89% year-over-year increase. Wall Street forecasts 102% EPS growth in Q3.


General Electric fueled $16.7 billion in revenue in Q2, marking a fifth straight quarter of accelerating growth over the prior-year quarters.


In terms of the company's fundamentals, GE earns a middling C SMR Rating in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-general-electric-ge.aspx). But overall, GE stock earns a strong 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?), meaning it's outpacing 95% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical factors.


GE Stock Winds Up In Weak Market
--------------------------------


Following Wednesday's [hawkish report by the Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut-hopes-dim-as-hawks-take-over-sp-500-slips/), the market sold off. In this environment, making new buys of any stock entails heightened risk.


GE stock continues to show relative strength and resilience as it forms a 117.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). Since the Fed report, GE stock has pulled back and is now trying to hold support at its 10-week moving average. It closed the week just below that benchmark.

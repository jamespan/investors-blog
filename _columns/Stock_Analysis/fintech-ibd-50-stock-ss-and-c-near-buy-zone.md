When looking for the best stocks to watch, look for accelerating earnings and sales growth and rising institutional demand. Top-rated fintech stock **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) certainly fits that bill.




With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, SS&C holds the No. 1 ranking among its fellow financial software and fintech stocks. And with three straight quarters of triple-digit sales growth, the Connecticut-based company has earned a spot on both the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). Both of these screens have a history of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


While SS&C didn't make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-splunk-stock-netflix-stock/), it has been showing strong institutional demand, including an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.

Fintech Stock With Accelerating Growth
--------------------------------------


SS&C has posted four quarters of accelerating earnings growth, rising from a 17% increase in Q4 of 2017 to a 76% spike in Q4 of last year. The company generated average annual EPS growth of 26% over the last three years.


Revenue gains have been even more impressive, ranging from 118% to 153% over the last three quarters. SS&C has been growing sales at an average annual pace of 39% over the last three years. The company also sports solid numbers for both annual pretax profit margins (34%) and return on equity (20%).


In 2018, total revenue more than doubled from $1.68 billion in 2017 to $3.42 billion. In Q4 alone, the company generated $1.11 billion in sales. SS&C has been helping to boost growth through [strategic acquisitions](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-ssc-technologies/).


Founded in 1986, SS&C provides fintech solutions for customers in the global financial markets, with offerings in the fields of asset management, banking and lending, insurance and more. Clients range from the world's largest institutions to local firms.


Base Count Reset
----------------


After a long run that began in the beginning of 2017, SS&C stock went into a 33% decline in the second half of last year as a bear market took hold. During that drop, the stock undercut the low in its prior chart pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making its current consolidation a first-stage formation.


The potential buy point is 61.07, 10 cents above the peak on the left side of the base.


One technical weak spot for the pattern is that the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) is still below the longer-term 40-week line. But on the positive side, the relative strength line is near a new 52-week high.


On Feb. 15, the stock jumped more than 6% in volume 163% above average after reporting earnings the day before. On Thursday, SS&C recouped most of an earlier dip to end the day 3% below the entry.

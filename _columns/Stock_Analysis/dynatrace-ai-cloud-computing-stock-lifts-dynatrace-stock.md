Even though the [coronavirus news](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) has been rattling Wall Street, it's always a good time to keep an eye on the top [IPO stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/). With average annual EPS growth of 320% over the last three years, AI and cloud computing stock **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) certainly fits that bill.




After going public in August, Dynatrace stock soon retreated, but has been generally trending higher since establishing a bottom in October.


The Massachusetts-based company provides "software intelligence" for enterprises in a wide range of industries and sectors, including retail, financial markets, transportation and government.


Dynatrace employs leading [AI technologies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) to help companies with their digital transformations and the ongoing shift to cloud-based operations.


Big Data, Big Earnings
----------------------


By working with Big Data analytics partners like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, Dynatrace is driving impressive earnings growth. Over the last three years, EPS gains have averaged 320%. The company also earned a passing grade in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) last quarter by posting 25% sales growth.


Dynatrace stock is part of the top-ranked enterprise software group. Fellow members include **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)).


Since its IPO last year, Dynatrace stock has seen solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/). It made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-apple-stock-microsoft-facebook-netflix-google/), with 16 funds investing an estimated $108.6 million in the stock. Plus, 60 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning Dynatrace shares.


Dynatrace Among Top IPO Stocks To Watch
---------------------------------------


While testing [support at its 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/), Dynatrace has earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) list. It may be forming a new consolidation, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) near new-high ground.


Stock market history shows stocks that become the biggest winners are often newer IPO stocks with explosive earnings growth, an innovative product or service, and strong institutional support. And these types of companies often make their biggest moves at the start of a new market uptrend.


Dynatrace currently meets those criteria, making it one of the best stocks to watch as we wait to see how the coronavirus crisis plays out.


On Friday, Dynatrace stock closed 9% lower as the coronavirus scare continued to spook the market. But the stock remains above its benchmark 10-week moving average.

Today we're going to look at **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), which was profiled in the Sept. 12 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/091113-670610-netease-ups-its-mobile-game-with-instant-messaging-app.htm). Based in China, it runs online games, internet portals and other services.

  

The stock got a nice boost in Aug. on word the firm is teaming with **China Telecom** ([CHA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHA)) to launch an instant messaging application called YiChat for smart phones.

  

NetEase is trying to gain muscle into China's fast-growing mobile communications space, which analysts say is where the future is.

  

One of YiChat's key features is that users can send free text and voice messages to any mobile phone or to fixed phone lines. And YiChat doesn't have to be installed on the receiving devices.

  

But NetEase also faces competition from Tencent Holdings, China's biggest internet company and the developer of the WeChat app, which is a mobile instant text and voice communications app. WeChat is popular and has a lot of users.

  

But NetEase has some advantages. For one thing analysts say it's more user friendly than WeChat. And YiChat is an open application so users can send messages to people who aren't registered users. And it's free.

  

Also, China Telecom will have the YiChat app pre-installed on their phones. Which gives NetEase distribution power.

  

**Key Fundamentals.**

  

•Earnings and sales growth hit a rough spot last year but have been rebounding. Earnings were up 30% last quarter, while sales rose 27%.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts predict earnings will climb 25% this year and 10% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netease-inc-adr-ntes.aspx) shows NetEase carries a 99 Composite Rating, the best in their Computer Software-Gaming industry group

  

It also sports the group's best EPS Rating.

  

The group as whole is ranked No. 12 among the 197 industries IBD follows, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows NetEase broke out of a long cup-with-handle base this summer, climbed a little, then stumbled, falling back below its ideal buy point.

  

On Aug. 19 and 20 the stock climbed on news of the deal with China Telecom to launch YiChat.

  

Since then it's been consolidating and trading in a rather narrow price range, which is a positive.

  

Watch to see if it goes on to form at base pattern or gives investors other opportunities to get on board.

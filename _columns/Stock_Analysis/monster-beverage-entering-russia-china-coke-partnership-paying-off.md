Is **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) poised to pop and stay energized into 2016? Here are three reasons that may be the case.


• **Coca-Cola Deal Paying Off**



Earlier this year, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) acquired almost 17% of Monster's stock in a strategic partnership, in which Coke transferred its global energy drink business to Monster. In exchange, Coca-Cola took over Monster's non-energy drink brands, including Hansen's Natural Sodas.


The deal also gives Monster access to Big Red's worldwide distribution network, which should give the maker of the Monster Energy, Burn and Nos brands a boost as it continues to expand internationally.


• **Energizing China, Russia**



A major part of Monster's global ambitions includes a move into Russia, expected later this year, with distribution handled by the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group.


Monster is also negotiating with Coke bottlers in China to introduce its energy drinks in that country in the first half of 2016.


• **2015 Earnings Growth Rising**



Analysts expect full-year 2015 earnings-per-share to rise 11%, then jump 28% in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


**Key Numbers**


After a slowdown in Q2, Monster posted accelerating growth for the third quarter, beating estimates for both the top and bottom lines.


Monster's 98 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot within the No. 2-ranked Beverages - Non-Alcoholic industry group, behind **Coca-Cola Bottling** ([COKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COKE)) and ahead of **National Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)) and **Dr. Pepper Snapple** ([DPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPS)).


**Chart Analysis**


Monster is working on a first-stage cup-with-handle with a 154 buy point, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.


After reporting earnings on Nov. 5, the stock jumped over 10% as it closed well above its 10-week line and near the top of the price range. Volume for the week was 57% above average, a sign of buying by fund managers and other large investors.


Since then, Monster has held on to the bulk of those gains and traded in a relatively tight range, with the Relative Strength line nearing new high ground.


See if the stock can clear the entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a breakout.

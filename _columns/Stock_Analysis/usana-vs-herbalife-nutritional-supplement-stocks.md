**Usana Health Sciences** ([USNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USNA)) and **Herbalife Nutrition** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) are both leaders in multilevel marketing (MLM) and nutritional supplements. But how do the two companies compare in terms of sales and earnings growth? And is either stock near a potential buy zone?




Herbalife was founded in 1980, while Usana got its start in 1992. Both companies sell a range of nutritional supplements, personal care, energy and weight loss products.


Usana and Herbalife distribute their products through direct sales using MLM. Multilevel marketing relies on nonsalaried, commission-based sales associates to sell the products. Sales associates can also recruit other people to join the sales network, with the recruiter then getting a piece of everything sold by the people they recruit.


As of the end of Q1, Usana had 288,000 active sales associates. The company also had 297,000 so-called preferred customers, which are consumers who purchase Usana products solely for their own personal use.


By comparison, Herbalife had approximately 4 million members (i.e., sales associates) at the end of last year.


At the Biotechnology Awards by Global Health & Pharma, Usana was named the [Best Nutritional Supplements Manufacturer of 2018](http://otp.investis.com/clients/us/usana/usn/usnews-story.aspx?cid=2096&newsid=54277). Herbalife was recently recognized as one of [Forbes Magazine's Best Midsize Employers](http://ir.herbalife.com/news-releases/news-release-details/herbalife-nutrition-recognized-one-forbes-magazines-best) for the third year in a row.

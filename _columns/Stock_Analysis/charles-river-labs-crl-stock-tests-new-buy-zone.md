Charles River Enters Exclusive Agreement With AI Software Partner
-----------------------------------------------------------------


In March, [Charles River Labs teamed up with Deciphex](https://ir.criver.com/news-releases/news-release-details/charles-river-laboratories-and-deciphex-form-partnership-enhance?field_nir_news_date_value[min]=2020), a leader in preclinical digital pathology software-as-a-service (SaaS). Using its Patholytix Preclinical platform, Deciphex uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help maximize pathologist productivity and deliver quality data to clients faster.


Through the partnership, Charles River Labs is now the exclusive CRO distributing the Patholytix Preclinical solution to clients. The organizations will also work together to develop deep learning-enabled tools. The collaboration combines Deciphex's digital pathology solutions with Charles River's drug discovery and development portfolio. The combination gives Charles River clients access to an "increasingly efficient, best-in-class platform."


Charles River Labs traces its roots back to 1947, when a young veterinarian named Dr. Henry Foster purchased 1,000 rat cages and set up shop in a one-man laboratory overlooking the Charles River. Today, the company has over 90 sites operating in more than 20 countries.


Involved in cardiovascular disease, immunology, oncology, neuroscience and more, the company supported as much as 85% of all drugs approved by the FDA in 2019.


Charles River has delivered four quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a 31% gain in Q1. Revenue has also been on the rise, ranging from 12% to 17% over the last four reports. The company sports a solid 16% annual pretax profit margin and a 23% return on equity, as well as strong [cash flow](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-analysis-cash-flow-margins-roe/).


The stock made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutuall-funds-invest-big-in-aapl-amzn-fb-nflx-googl-msft-adbe-zm-docu/), and 52 A+ funds have reported a position in Charles River Labs stock.


Charles River Swims Toward All-Time High â€” And New Buy Zone
-----------------------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) floating just below a 52-week high, Charles River Labs stock is 4% shy of a 189.95 entry.


The stock has found [support at its 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) as it forms a tighter and healthier base, following its rebound from the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/). A breakout would mark a new all-time high for Charles River stock.


On Thursday, CRL stock showed resilience to come off its lows for the day and close essentially flat. As the stock market again encountered resistance on Friday, Charles River Laboratories slipped lower, losing 2% but in below-average volume.

As cloud computing peer **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) clears a new buy zone, analytics and creative software firm **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) may be setting up a new move of its own. Adobe stock closed the shortened Thanksgiving trading week just 1% below a potential entry.


Microsoft broke out on Oct. 28, and has continued to move steadily higher. It's now extended just beyond its buy zone.


Boosted by a 39.6% profit margin and a 37.8% return on equity, Adobe is looking to follow suit. The San Jose, Calif.-based stock has formed an early stage cup-shaped pattern showing a 313.21 buy point.


Over the last three years, Adobe has grown earnings at an annual pace of 43%. Revenue has increased an average of 24% a year during the same period.


Adobe Ties Microsoft With 93 Composite Rating
---------------------------------------------


Solid fundamentals and technicals have Adobe and Microsoft tied with a 93 Composite Rating, a sign that they're both outpacing 93% of all stocks. But their industry group ranking is a lowly No. 112 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Ideally, stocks will hail from a group that ranks 40 or higher.


Through expansion of its creative cloud strategy, data analytics, and customer experience businesses, [Adobe is looking to enhance its long-term growth](https://news.adobe.com/press-release/corporate/adobe-leadership-creativity-digital-documents-and-customer-experience).


In recent years, Adobe has successfully increased its recurring revenue by transitioning to a subscription model for its creative and analytics software solutions.


Breakout Ahead For Adobe Stock?
-------------------------------


Adobe just closed out its sixth straight up week. The stock saw heavy selling in the left-side of its current chart pattern, but has since shown signs of rebounding strength, including a heavy-volume gap-up on Nov. 5. It's a positive sign to see such a sharp rise in price and volume within a base.


In an encouraging sign of institutional demand, Adobe has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Another impressive statistic is that 314 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in the stock.

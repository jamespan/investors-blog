Â 


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) pulled some of its sandwiches due to an E. coli scare, but its stock action shows it's still dreaming of a White Christmas espresso breakout.


The coffee giant pulled its "holiday turkey with stuffing paninis" from West Coast stores last month since they contained celery from the same source that delivered E. coli-contaminated produce to **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)).


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) also recently got hit with an E. coli outbreak that has been traced to at least six states.

The Seattle-based coffee chain has found pioneering success with its Mobile Order & Pay app that lets **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Android smartphone users skip the lines by pre-ordering their drinks.


Starbucks hopes to make its mobile and in-store customers merry with a new seasonal concoction, Holiday Spice Flat White, made from a Christmas Blend Espresso Roast.


The company is also expected to adopt Apple Pay for direct payment at all of its U.S. locations sometime in 2016.


**Key Numbers**


Starbucks has delivered three consecutive quarters of 18% revenue growth, while earnings gains have ranged from 16% to 24% during the same period.


For its fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 27, the java giant met earnings expectations and topped on revenue and same-store-sales growth.


For fiscal 2016, analysts expect earnings to rise 20%, followed by a 15% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Starbucks pays a dividend currently yielding 1% and has a 43% return on equity.


The Group Relative Strength Rating is a lowly 33, and the No. 138 ranking for the restaurants industry puts it well into the bottom half of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Overall, Starbucks earns a 92 Composite Rating.


**Chart Analysis**


Starbucks kicked off 2015 by breaking out of a [flat base](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=3) in January, rising as much as 40% before pulling back to form a second-stage base in August.


After breaking out in October, the stock rose less than 8% before starting to form a new consolidation.


Since the gain was less than 20% from the prior buy point, the current flat base is considered part of a longer base-on-base formation.


Starbucks has been testing the 10-week line and has so far found support. See if the stock can hold its ground, then break past the 64.10 buy point in heavy volume.

As REIT stocks like **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) and **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)) hit new highs, industry peer **National Storage Affiliates** ([NSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSA)) has unlocked a [renewed breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-failed-breakout/). In addition to hailing from a highly ranked industry group, these real estate investment trusts have also secured space among the [best dividend stocks](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/) to buy and watch.




**CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)), which is testing its own breakout, edges out National Storage among highly rated REITs that also qualify as leading dividend stocks. CubeSmart's 3.1% annualized yield tops that of National Storage (2.4%), Extra Space Storage (2.3%), Public Storage (2.2%) and **Rexford Industrial Realty** ([REXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REXR)) (1.2%).


An article on Dec. 8 noted how [REIT stocks dominated the IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/reit-stocks-lead-this-index-as-the-market-fights-back/). With the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) under pressure, in addition to being among the leading dividend stocks, REITs have also been among the top names in terms of technical action. Public Storage, Extra Space Storage and Rexford Industrial Realty are extended from recent [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Meanwhile, National Storage has cleared a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and CubeSmart is just below the 56.74 entry it briefly cleared on Tuesday.


Extra Space Storage earns the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), while CubeSmart, Public Storage and Rexford all sport a 98 rating. National Storage is just behind with a 97 Composite Rating, meaning it is outpacing 97% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


With so many REITs earning high marks in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), it's no surprise that the property REIT group ranks a solid No. 34 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.

REITs, Dividend Stocks To Watch: National Storage Hits 1,000 Store Milestone
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


National Storage Affiliates acquired, owns and operates self storage facilities in 38 states plus Puerto Rico. It has approximately 60.4 million rentable square feet. Earlier this month, the Colorado-based company announced it had hit the [1,000 store milestone](https://www.nationalstorageaffiliates.com/newsroom-features/detail/131/national-storage-affiliates-trust-celebrates-1000-store).


Rather than earnings per share, REIT stocks report funds from operations or FFO. In Q3, National Storage reported FFO growth vs. year-ago levels of 30%. For Q4, analysts forecast an increase of 26% and a 24% increase for the full year.


In Q3, the REIT delivered sales growth of 38% to $150.8 million.


While National Storage did not join CubeSmart on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-aapl-nvda-msft-googl-crm/), it has shown signs of solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/). In addition to eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership, 25 funds with an A or better rating from IBD have a position in National Storage.


National Storage Tries To Unlock Buy Zone
-----------------------------------------


Earning its spot among top REIT and dividend stocks, National Storage has made a steady and impressive climb since retaking its [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) in May 2020 following the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/).


It has now cleared resistance right around a 65.08 buy point in a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). National Storage briefly broke past that entry on Dec. 13 after flashing a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) in heavy volume. While the gain was short-lived, the dividend stock has shown resilience, floating right around the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) despite bouts of heavy selling in the major [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-beat-stock-market-7-mental-tips/).


In a sign of resilience and market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) remains just shy of a new 52-week high.


National Storage Affiliates is now solidly in the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), trading 3% above the initial buy point. Confirming its resilience, the stock ended the short trading week by coming off its lows for the day to close near the top of its range.

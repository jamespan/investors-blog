 With Donald Trump promising to roll back "burdensome" regulations and boost domestic energy production, oil and natural gas stocks like **Rice Midstream Partners** ([RMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMP)) may be primed to move higher.
Trump's [America First Energy Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy) says his administration "will embrace the shale oil and gas revolutions" and eliminate "harmful and unnecessary policies" — all of which is music to the ears of Rice Midstream Partners and its peers in the Oil & Gas-Transportation/Pipeline industry group.


Pumping Out Accelerating Growth
-------------------------------


Rice Midstream saw its Composite Rating jump to 95 this week, earning it the No. 3 spot within the No. 65-ranked group.


Argentina-based **Transportadaora de Gas del Sur** ([TGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGS)) holds the No. 1 ranking, with **Noble Midstream Partners** ([NBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBLX)) (a 2016 IPO), **Antero Midstream Partners** ([AM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AM)) and **Dynagas LNG Partners** ([DLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLNG)) rounding out the top five.


The term midstream refers to the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of oil and natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG).


Rice focuses its midstream operations in the Applachian Basin in Pennsylvania, servicing producers in the rapidly developing dry gas core of the Marcellus Shale.


The company posted accelerating earnings in Q4, with growth jumping from 43% to 83%. Sales growth also spiked, from 37% to 103%.


Earnings-per-share gains over the last three quarters have averaged 69%, while revenue growth over the last three years is a remarkable 844%.


Those stellar numbers have garnered interest among institutional investors, as reflected in Rice's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


Rice also pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.9%.


Getting Energized?
------------------


Although Rice Midstream Partners originally struggled following its December 2014 initial public offering, it's been rising steadily since January 2016, earning it a spot on IBD's [IPO Leaders screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).


The stock is now working on a flat base as part of a first-stage [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-base-on-base).



On Friday, the stock temporarily cleared the 25.81 entry as it gapped up to close nearly 6% higher in huge volume.


Rice held those gains and edged higher on Monday, then slipped lower in early trading Tuesday as [oil prices fell on news that Saudi Arabia had raised its production](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-raises-2017-demand-outlook-saudi-arabia-says-it-raised-output-past-key-mark/) in February.


But the stock found support at the 10-day line and rebounded in heavy volume to close slightly higher for the day.


See if the stock can punch decisively past the buy point, and look for the Relative Strength line to enter new high ground.


*Update*: As of Thursday afternoon, Rice Midstream Partners was trading just above the 25.81 entry and within the buy zone that extends to 27.10. Volume was trending around double the stock's daily average.

A [rate hike by the Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-hints-of-coming-pivot-sp-500-rises-with-powell-up-next/) sparked a sell-off Wednesday, causing a spill for **Graphic Packaging** ([GPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPK)). But the leading maker of paperboard and paper-based packaging has earned a spot on both the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-index-highlights-nflx-wing-enph-cvx-and-more/) as it cleans up the [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) in its base.




With a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), GPK stock scores top billing among its peers in the Paper & Paper Products [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


Graphic Packaging delivered Q3 earnings growth of 79% on Oct. 25. Analysts forecast an 84% surge in the fourth quarter, leading to 98% earnings growth for the full year.


Over the last three years, the company has generated average annual EPS growth of 23%. Wall Street is forecasting 11% earnings growth for 2023.

Can GPK Stock Wrap Up A Breakout?
---------------------------------


After beating top- and bottom-line Q3 estimates last month, Graphic Packaging soared to retake its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). GPK stock closed in on a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and all-time high before the market put a lid on it.


The stock hit resistance and retreated, adding a handle to form a [cup-with-handle chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). On Thursday, the stock found support at its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), bouncing higher in tepid volume. The stock rose nearly 2% early Friday, putting it within striking distance of a 23.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


[Volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) in the handle has drifted lower, a sign that large investors are not selling aggressively. But the sharp Fed-induced drop in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) has added an extra dose of caution and concern to the nascent uptrend.


See if Graphic Packaging can fortify its base and refill its cup and handle to launch a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

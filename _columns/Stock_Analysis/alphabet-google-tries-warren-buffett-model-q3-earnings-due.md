Why did Google change its name to **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))? One reason, says Chairman Eric Schmidt, is to emulate another successful conglomerate: Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)).

  

As [Quartz reported](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/eric-schmidt-explains-alphabet-emulate-163102640.html), Schmidt said: "Alphabet is an attempt to build a holding company like Berkshire Hathaway out of an existing operating company. It's never been done before."

  

As the parent of Google and YouTube gets ready to report Q3 earnings on Oct. 22, its core businesses are in good shape.

  

YouTube continues to perform well in its battle with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) for dominance in online video and related ad revenue.

  

Evercore ISI analyst Ken Sena expects [YouTube's 2015 revenue to rise 40%](http://news.investors.com/technology/101815-776137-google-alphabet-q3-earnings-preview.htm) to $9 billion. That's well above Credit Suisse's $6 billion projection made in an industry report from July.

  

Alphabet is also expected to announce a paid YouTube service, although it's not clear how effectively it can gain traction against established rivals like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Amazon**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Amazon Prime and Hulu.

  

For Q3 and beyond, a growing portion of the company's search revenue is expected to come from mobile, which is on pace to surpass desktop search revenue next year.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

In Q2, earnings growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising from 5% to 17%. Sales growth slowed slightly, from 12% to 11%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to increase 13%, followed by a 17% gain in 2016.

  

Alphabet's 98 Composite Rating earns it the No. 3 slot within the Internet-Content group, behind **Autobytel** ([ABTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABTL)) and Facebook. The group is currently ranked No. 5 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock is forming a base and trading just below a potential buy point ahead of Thursday's Q3 earnings report.

  

Prior to the company's Q2 report, the stock was trading in a very tight range right along its 10-week line.

  

It gapped up the day after reporting earnings, closing over 16% higher on volume 556% above average. Volume had also been rising ahead of earnings, a sign large investors were picking up shares.

  

Alphabet's stock then pulled back to form its current base, where it again found support at the 10-week moving average.

  

The choppiness within the base reflects the volatility seen in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

  

But the stock found support at its prior area of resistance around the 605 mark. That's healthy action, since it could mean Alphabet is building a stepping stone to help it climb even higher.

  

Also note how the Relative Strength line has moved into new high ground ahead of a potential breakout.

  

The buy point is 713.43, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if the company can report strong Q3 numbers and punch through that entry in heavy volume.

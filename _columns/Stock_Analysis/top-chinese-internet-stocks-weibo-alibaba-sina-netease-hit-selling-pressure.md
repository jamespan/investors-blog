Thursday's action might not qualify as the Great Fall of China, but Chinese internet stocks certainly took a hit.


**Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), the so-called Twitter of China, fell over 10% in volume 109% above average as it sliced right through a key line of support.


Chinese e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) fell over 4%, while **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) (-6%) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) (-2%) also took haircuts. **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) fared better than its Chinese compatriots, slipping less than 1%. Chinese online gaming leader **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) dropped nearly 3%.


Big Stakes For Sina, Alibaba
----------------------------


Weibo, which went public in April 2014, was spun off by Sina, a Chinese internet portal that retains a controlling interest in the company.


Alibaba bought an 18% stake prior to Weibo's IPO, then boosted its ownership position to 31.5% in September of this year.


On Nov. 21, [Weibo topped analyst estimates for top and bottom line Q3 numbers](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/china-internet-firms-post-strong-earnings-that-beat-q3-estimates/), posting at least its eighth-straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth. Revenue gains have ranged from 24% to 48% over the past eight reports.


As of September, Weibo had 297 million monthly active users, with 89% of users on mobile devices.


Getting Handle On New Base?
---------------------------


Weibo was [featured in the March 24 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/two-factors-driving-explosive-growth-for-the-twitter-of-china/) as it was working on a first-stage base. It went on to form a handle and broke out April 6 to launch a 191% run before peaking six months later.



Weibo's current base is technically considered a second-stage pattern, but investors should not ignore the big move it's already made this year.


On Friday, Weibo tried to rebound, but again ran into selling pressure, giving back most of the day's gains to close less than 1% higher.


The stock is one day away from completing a handle, which would offer a 52.59 entry. But proceed with caution since volume in the pullback has been heavy and the market outlook has changed to "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/)."

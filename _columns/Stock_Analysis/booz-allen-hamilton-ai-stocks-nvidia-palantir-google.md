When investors think of the giants of artificial intelligence, [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) or maybe **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) come to mind. But defense, intelligence and civil management consultant **Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)) wears the crown as the [largest provider of AI to the federal government](https://www.boozallen.com/expertise/artificial-intelligence.html).




While [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [Meta](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-buy-now/), [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/), [Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) and [Palantir](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/) all made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-uber-msft-google-meta/), Booz Allen Hamilton also secured a spot on the list.


Boosted by strong institutional demand and a B+[Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-up-down-volume-ratio-spots-underlying-demand-for-stocks/), BAH stock has now crafted a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) with a 150.59 buy point. A breakout would propel the stock an all-time high.


Virginia-based Booz Allen Hamilton earns a [94 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-booz-allen-hamilton-hldg-bah.aspx). The rating shows it is outpacing 94% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Booz Allen Hamilton Drives AI In Government
-------------------------------------------


Across its three major business segments — defense, civil government and intelligence — Booz Allen Hamilton is leading the AI push throughout the federal government. Last year, the firm was recognized as the [largest provider of AI-related services to the federal government](https://www.defenseandmunitions.com/news/booz-allen-leads-artificial-intelligence-ai-deployment-us-government/) by researcher [GovWin from Deltek](https://info.deltek.com/Federal-AI-Landscape-2024-GovWin).


Booz Allen Hamilton works with the Defense Department to try and get ahead of adversaries in the global AI race. Collaborating with the Pentagon, it is working to integrate AI into all aspects of missions and operations. That includes training an AI-ready workforce and defining and building the related infrastructure.


In the civil government space, Booz Allen's work spans energy and the environment, financial services, health, homeland security, law enforcement, and transportation. The company deploys cognitive search algorithms and develops models to predict global health threats. It also leverages computer vision to identify suspicious packages.


In the intelligence arena, Booz Allen Hamiltion works across the federal government to harness AI to support intelligence analysts and improve decision-making.


Earnings Pop
------------


On Jan. 26, Booz Allen Hamilton posted an earnings surprise, [topping forecasts for the third quarter](https://investors.boozallen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/booz-allen-hamilton-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-results) of fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 31. The company generated earnings of $1.41 per share, a 32% year-over-year gain. Sales rose 13% to roughly $2.57 billion.


On May 24, the consulting firm is set to report results for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31. Analyst estimates call for a 22% rise to $1.23 a share. A revenue gain of 12% to just over $2.7 billion is expected.


Booz Allen Hamilton sports an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/) of A. The rating tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. But the company does carry a heavy debt-to-equity ratio of 279%.


AI Stocks BAH, NVDA Craft Buy Points
------------------------------------


Among other AI players, Google stock closed out the week with resilience, rising for a third straight day to remain extended from last month's breakout. Further, Nvidia keeps its base and 974 buy point intact and has just jumped back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) as the tech-heavy Nasdaq did the same. With earnings due May 22, the semiconductor industry powerhouse earns a spot on [IBD Sector Leaders](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/nvidia-nvda-stock-sp500-market-cap-2-trillion-ai-magnificent-seven/), our most stringent stock screen.


Microsoft's flat base also remains intact, but selling pressure has dragged the stock below its 50-day benchmark. Like Nvidia, MSFT stock rose for a third straight day Friday.


Fellow AI stock Palantir has gone on a rocky ride since clearing a 21.85 buy point out in February. PLTR stock has held support above an earlier buy point as it builds a new base. [Set to report earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/palantir-stock-q1-earnings-arm-arista-stock/) on May 6, the enterprise software firm, which teamed up with **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) last month to [expand initiatives in AI and cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-rises-oracle-deal-for-ai-cloud-computing-services/), tried to poke its head above its 50-day line on Friday.


Meanwhile, Booz Allen Hamilton has crafted an early stage flat base showing a 150.59 buy point. The stock continues to hold support at its 50-day line, once again bouncing off that benchmark on Friday.


BAH stock gapped up in heavy volume on its Jan. 26 earnings report. Since then, it has moved mostly sideways, refusing to fill the gap — a sign of strength.


Another promising sign in this troubled market is the upward trending [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/), which is within striking distance of a 52-week high.

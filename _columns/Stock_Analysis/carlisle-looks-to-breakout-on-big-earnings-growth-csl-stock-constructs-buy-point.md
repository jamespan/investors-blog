With Q2 earnings due July 27, [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Carlisle** ([CSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSL)) looks to punch through recent resistance and break out into a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). Boosted by 209% EPS growth last quarter and triple-digit estimates for its upcoming report, CSL stock has also earned a spot on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-medical-sector-leads-new-buys-by-top-funds-while-big-mac-joins-big-oil/).




Founded in 1917, today the Arizona-based company leverages the Carlisle Operating System — and dozens of acquisitions — to provide solutions for the roofing, construction and a wide range of other industries.


Carlisle employs nearly 13,000 people in businesses including Construction Materials, Weatherproofing Technologies, Interconnect Technologies, Fluid Technologies and Brake & Friction.


In addition to earning a spot on the IBD 50 and the list of new buys by top funds, Carlisle also made Newsweek's list of [America's Most Responsible Companies 2022](https://www.newsweek.com/americas-most-responsible-companies-2022). The list recognizes the [best ESG companies](https://www.investors.com/news/esg-companies-list-best-esg-stocks-environmental-social-governance-values/) that are making a difference through their environmental, social and governance actions.


Carlisle Posts Big Growth — And Consistent Dividends
----------------------------------------------------


Acquisitions continue to play an integral role in Carlisle's growth. The company has added 85 companies to its portfolio in the past 30 years. Carlisle bought [MBTechnology in February](https://www.carlisle.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2022/Carlisle-Companies-to-Acquire-MBTechnology-Inc/default.aspx), expanding its footprint in the roofing sector for residential and commercial applications.


Since 2008, Carlisle has deployed over $6 billion into over 30 acquisitions.


The MBTechology acquisition fits into [Carlisle's Vision 2025](https://www.carlisle.com/who-we-are/vision-2025/default.aspx) initiative. This plan aims to double annual revenues to $8 billion by that year. The company also targets expanding operating margins to 20% and with an aim of driving further growth in the bottom line.


With Q1 earnings growth of 209% under its belt, analysts expect Carlisle to post a 131% EPS increase when it reports later this month. Sales growth has accelerated from a 2% decline in the first quarter of 2021 to increases of 22%, 24%, 39% and 59% on a year-over-year basis over the past four quarters.


CSL stock has constructed the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). It also scores an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


Carlisle has paid consecutive and increasing dividends since 1976. It currently pays a dividend yielding 0.8% on an annualized basis.


CSL Stock Closing In On Double-Bottom Breakout
----------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already hitting a new high, Carlisle is eyeing a 272.68 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


CSL stock has climbed steadily higher since coming off its pandemic lows in 2020. It has generally found support along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/). As it builds its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/), Carlisle eased back Friday as the indexes fell. But the stock kept its five-week win streak intact.


As the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) look to keep escaping the claws of this year's recent [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/), see if Carlisle can make good on its big estimates. Such news may launch a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Carlisle ended the week 2% shy of the buy point.

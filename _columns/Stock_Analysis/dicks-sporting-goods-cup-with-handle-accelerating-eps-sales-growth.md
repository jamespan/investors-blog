Boosted by a 287% spike in Q3 earnings growth, retailer **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) is trying strengthen its base and pump out a new breakout.




DKS stock has already shown a remarkable run off the low it hit in the coronavirus crash. After bottoming out, Dick's Sporting Goods gained as much as 365% before pulling back to form its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


The big rise in Q3 earnings came on top of a 155% increase in the second quarter. Analysts expect the Pennsylvania-based company to deliver 54% EPS growth for the full year.

Dick's Sporting Goods : Top Funds Suit Up As Growth Accelerates
---------------------------------------------------------------


Founded in 1948, Dick's Sporting Goods offers sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. It operates 732 locations across the country.


In addition to the strong resurgence in earnings, the sports retailer has shown accelerating sales growth. From low single-digit revenue growth or actual declines, Dick's Sporting Goods has posted 23% and 20% revenue gains in the past two quarters.


Some of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-stocks-to-watch-amzn-amd-tsm-etsy/) have taken notice. Including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), 53 funds sporting an A or better rating from IBD own shares.

DKS Stock Forms Cup With Handle
-------------------------------


During its big run after the coronavirus crash, Dick's Sporting Goods gapped up to a nearly 16% one-day gain Aug. 26 on earnings. In mid-October, it hit a peak and pulled back, filling the gap as it fell below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). The stock is now trying to reclaim that benchmark as it forms a handle in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/)  (best viewed on a daily chart.)


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has been trending lower. Look for that to reverse to show a rebound in stock market leadership.


With a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), DKS stock earns a passing rating in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).

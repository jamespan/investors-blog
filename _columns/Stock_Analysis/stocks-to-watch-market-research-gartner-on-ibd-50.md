On Tuesday, technology market research leader **Gartner** ([IT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IT)) was [added to the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ulta-centene-autozone-ibd50-watch-list/) list of leading growth stocks. And it's setting up a potential breakout move in an early stage base, qualifying it as one of the top stocks to watch.




While Gartner didn't make a recent list of [13 stocks to watch in this volatile market](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-volatile-market-relative-strength/), it has been showing resilience and relative strength while forming its latest [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Plus, 100 of the best mutual funds with an A+ rating have reported owning the stock.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is just below a new 52-week high as the stock builds the right side of a flat base, a bullish indicator of market leadership.

Stocks To Watch: No. 1-Rated Market Research Firm
-------------------------------------------------


With a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Gartner holds the No. 1 ranking within the market research industry group. **Verisk Analytics** ([VRSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSK)), **FactSet Research Systems** ([FDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDS)), **CoStar** ([CSGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSGP)) and **Morningstar** ([MORN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MORN)) round out the top five industry stocks. Among its peers, only Gartner is on the IBD 50, which has a track record of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


Based in Connecticut, Gartner has approximately 15,000 employees in more than 100 countries, generating nearly $4 billion in annual revenue. The S&P 500 member helps clients make better strategic decisions by providing market research on technology trends and advisory services.


The company posted a nice jump in earnings growth in Q3, from 17% the previous quarter to 31%. But sales growth slowed for the second quarter in a row, from 19% to 11%.


Gartner has a stellar 57% return on equity, but also significant debt. Its debt-to-equity ratio stands at 295%.


Stocks To Watch: Technical Breakout Ahead?
------------------------------------------


Gartner recently retook its 10-week line while building the right side of a new flat base. In terms of its weekly closes, trading has been generally tight, a positive sign in the face of a very volatile market.


But after a day off to honor former president George H.W. Bush, the stock market continued Tuesday's sell-off, putting pressure on most stocks, including Gartner. The stock gapped down below its 50-day moving average at the open. But the indexes managed to reduce their losses by the close, and Gartner also cut its decline to 1.4% at 147.86. See if Gartner can retake its 50-day line in strong trade.


Note that selling volume in the left side of the pattern was heavy. That, plus selling pressure this week, is why Gartner's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has fallen to a D+. Look for that to improve to a B or better as the stock tries to clear a 161.31 buy point.


Keep in mind that the current market outlook is "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)." It's best to be very picky about any new buys in this type of environment. If Gartner does break out, look for volume to be at least 40% above average on the day of that move.


On Friday, the stock failed to fight off the down market, falling 2.7% to 143.93, leaving it 2.8% below  its 50-day line and 8% below the buy point.

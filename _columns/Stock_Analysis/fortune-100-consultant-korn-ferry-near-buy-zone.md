No. 1 Ranked Stock In Top Industry Group
----------------------------------------


Korn Ferry shares the No. 2 ranking within the Commercial Services-Staffing group with **Mastech Digital** ([MHH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHH)), **Heidrick & Struggles** ([HSII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSII)) and China-based recruiting services and job search firm **51job** ([JOBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOBS)). **ASGN** ([ASGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASGN)) earns the top spot with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.  The group ranks No. 22 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


While Korn Ferry doesn't have explosive growth, it has posted three straight quarters of double-digit top- and bottom-line gains. Revenue growth has ranged from 10% to 17% over that period, while earnings increases have ranged from 14% to 32%.


While Korn Ferry did not make IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-new-buys-adobe-abiomed-macys-kohls/), it has been showing strong institutional demand. It sports a 1.9 up/down volume ratio, A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and four quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 143 mutual funds with an A- or better rating have a position in the stock.


Will The Stock Market Uptrend Continue?
---------------------------------------


On June 13, Korn Ferry posted a 12% one-day gain following its earnings report for fiscal 2018 Q4 (ended April 30). Since then, the stock has been forming an early stage flat base showing a 68.44 buy point. The stock has been showing resilience in the face of recent selling pressure in the market, and its relative strength line remains near new-high ground.



But with the [current market outlook](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) now at "uptrend under pressure," the big question is, [will the stock market rally hold](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=449875) or will it roll over into a correction? That's a critical issue to watch since most stocks move in the same direction as the general market, represented by the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average.


See if the indexes can hold their ground and resume their climb, and if Korn Ferry can push through its buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal. The Nasdaq  managed to find support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) Tuesday and is moving higher above that benchmark early Wednesday.


In morning trading Wednesday, Korn Ferry is edging higher to just over 66, putting it 3% below the entry.

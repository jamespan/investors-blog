After getting a little work done in its current base, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) may be getting ready to debut a new breakout. The one-stop-shop cosmetics retailer has multiple [catalysts for driving growth](http://news.investors.com/investing/100915-774988-ulta-has-many-loyal-customers.htm).


• **Customer Loyalty Program**


One is the ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program, which has been a big hit with customers and now has approximately 15 million members.


In addition to offering incentives to shoppers, the proprietary database helps Ulta understand purchasing patterns and identify possible new store locations.


• **"Authentic Indie" Brands**


Along with global perfume and cosmetics retailer Sephora, Ulta has been [taking market share](http://news.investors.com/101415-775553-ulta-sephora-gain-beauty-share-cvs-target.htm) from **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) and other drugstores by attracting teen shoppers with "authentic indie" brands, such as Urban Decay. That's part of a trend showing teens are shifting way from general retailers like **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) to specialty beauty stores such as Ulta.


• **New Store Expansion**


In Q2, the Bolingbrook, Ill.-based company opened 20 new locations, bringing its total count to 817 stores in 48 states. For fiscal 2015, which ends Jan. 31, 2016, Ulta plans to expand square footage by approximately 13% with the opening of 100 net new stores.


• **E-Commerce**


Ulta's online business is another growth catalyst. In fiscal 2014, e-commerce revenue grew 56%. That trend continued in Q2 2015, when online sales jumped 43% compared to the year-earlier quarter.


Ulta aims to keep growing its e-commerce business, from 5% of total revenue last year to 19% by 2019.


**Key Numbers**


The beauty retailer's sales growth has been strong and steady, ranging from 19% to 22% over the last six quarters. Earnings growth has followed a similar trajectory, coming in between 18% and 35% during the same period.


Fiscal Q3 earnings are expected Dec. 3.


One weak spot for Ulta is the low 44 Relative Strength Rating for its Retail—Specialty industry group, which currently ranks No. 118, putting it well into the bottom half of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


But Ulta is the clear leader among its industry peers, earning "Best in Group" scores for its EPS, SMR, Accumulation/Distribution and Composite Ratings.


The stock has also found favor with fund managers, and three typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: Fidelity Contrafund , Turner Emerging Growth and Dreyfus Mid-Cap Growth .


**Chart Analysis**


Since breaking out of a long and deep cup-with-handle last October, Ulta has climbed higher in tight trading, finding support along the 10-week moving average line.


The only significant break in that trend was during the week of the Aug. 24 flash crash. But even then, the stock quickly recovered to close just below that benchmark line.


While that sudden dip technically gives the current base a depth of 32%, if you exclude that market-wide anomaly and use the low from the following week, the depth is just 13%, putting it within the normal 10%-15% decline in a flat base.


The traditional buy point is 176.87, 10 cents above the peak on the left. More aggressive investors could use a prior point of resistance plus 10 cents as an earlier entry, giving a potential buy point of 170.31.

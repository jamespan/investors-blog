After a strong quarterly earnings report on Nov. 1, **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) bolted 16.1% higher in just one day. The installer of insulation and related products is now consolidating those gains and may be setting up its next [breakout move](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


With a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Installed Building Products is outperforming 96% of all stocks and holds the No. 1 ranking among its industry peers. Very thinly traded **IES Holdings** ([IESC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IESC)), **Emcor** ([EME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EME)), **Frontdoor** ([FTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTDR)) and **Vectrus** ([VEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEC)) round out the top five stocks in the group.


Frontdoor, which had its IPO in October, has bounced back from an initial decline and is also setting up a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). IES and Vectrus have already broken out, while Emcor is also forming a new [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


Earlier this month, Installed Building Products acquired Gulf Coast Insulation, which provides spray foam and fiberglass insulation services in the Florida Panhandle region.

Has Solid Earnings Growth Insulated Installed Building Products?
----------------------------------------------------------------



Installed Building Products has generated average EPS growth of 21% over the last three quarters. Over the last three years, annual EPS growth has averaged 29%, while yearly revenue gains have averaged 21%.


[Institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-best-buys-alibaba-facebook-microsoft-lead-stocks-to-watch/) like what they see, helping the stock earn a solid B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), 1.7 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/), and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


Installed Building Products Gaps Up On EPS Beat
-----------------------------------------------


A gap up in heavy volume is a positive sign of demand. It shows interest in the stock is so strong that the price immediately jumps higher, rather than rising incrementally. Installed Building Products did just that after beating analyst earnings estimates when it reported on Nov. 1.


Installed Building Products initially cleared a 61.38 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [large, deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) on Oct. 15. It got extended just days later when it moved [above the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) at 64.45. But later in the month, IBP drifted back into buying range; on Oct. 30, shares briefly dipped below the buy point with an intraday low of 61.23 before heading back higher.



Some gap-ups in price offer an [alternative entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) when the stock leaps so far above the [normal buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a base, such as the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), that one could not buy it within [the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).


After jumping 16.1% on that move in just one day, the stock pulled back to digest that gain. Note how it has been trading within a relatively tight range and trying to hold support around its short-term, 10-day moving average. Such behavior is a positive indication that investors are sitting tight in expectations of a continued climb.


On Thursday, Installed Building Products fell over 4% in light, but rising volume, putting it 10% below its 76.70 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). On Friday, IBP bounced back to close up nearly 3%, right at its 10-day moving average and about 8% below the buy point.

While e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) search for support and **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) consolidates recent gains , fellow [Chinese internet stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) is trying to complete a new base and establish a potential buy zone.




Although 58.com is not as well-known as Alibaba, it has earned a place on IBD's [Stock Spotlight screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/),


58.com, sometimes referred to as the Craigslist of China, operates the largest online marketplace serving local merchants and consumers in China.


It appears to be turning into a profitable business model. 58.com posted a 2,950% spike in earnings last quarter, although that gain is based on comparisons to a year-over-year quarter that showed a loss.


Sales growth has accelerated for four straight quarters, coming in at 41% in Q4. 58.com is expected to release its next earnings report around May 23, with analysts looking for 110% EPS growth.


No. 1 Ranked Chinese Internet Stock
-----------------------------------


With a 98 Composite Rating, 58.com shares the No. 2 ranking in the internet content industry group with  Weibo. **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) holds the top slot, while **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and [2017 IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)) round out the top 5 leaders. The group ranks No. 34 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Alibaba, which is in the No. 13-ranked internet retailers group, earns a 98 Composite Rating.

New Breakout Ahead?
-------------------


58.com has been on a tear since finding a bottom in February 2017, rising as much as 218% from a low of 27.58. Alibaba, Weibo and Baozun have also made big moves since the beginning of last year.


The stock is now working on a cup with handle showing an 86.09 entry. It sports a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.0 up/down volume ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership.



Note that 58.com is trying to form a later-stage base. Such patterns can generate nice gains, but they're more risky since the stock has already made a big move by the time they form. Alibaba and Weibo are also consolidating in what would be later-stage patterns.


Plus, note that the general market ran into increased selling pressure this week. Alibaba, Baozun, Weibo and 58.com all sold off along with the indexes on Tuesday.


On Wednesday, 58.com managed to bounce off its 50-day line and come off its morning lows to end the day down less than 1%. Alibaba was down 1.7%, and also off its lows for the day. Weibo fared worse, losing almost 5%, but it did close above its 200-day line.


Baozun fell 3% to close right at its 50-day line. The provider of e-commerce solutions is now just 7% above the buy point it cleared on March 6.

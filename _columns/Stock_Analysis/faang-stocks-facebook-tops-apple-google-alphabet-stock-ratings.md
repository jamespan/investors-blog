As **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) continues its turnaround, fellow [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are also showing signs of renewed strength.




Apple stock broke out in September and has risen around 20% since then. Alphabet is also on the rise and adding to those gains on Friday. It's now trading at the upper range of its buy zone.


Facebook stock is forming a cup with handle base and is now just 2% below the entry. With rising analyst estimates for 2020, Facebook may be ready to launch its own rebound.

--------------------------------


While Facebook faces increased scrutiny of how it handles the [2020 presidential election](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Facebook-Helps-to-Protect-the-2020-US-Elections/default.aspx), Facebook stock has investors voting for a continued comeback.


Since a peak in July, Facebook has been forming a base as it tries to recover from a sharp decline that began in the summer of 2018. Alphabet also retreated around the same time, but it showed a milder pullback.


Facebook's potential buy point is 198.19. It's above the 10-week line, but is still shy of a new 52-week high for its relative strength line.


With a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Facebook is outperforming 94% of stocks. That currently ties Apple and tops Alphabet's score of 90.


Analysts expect Facebook earnings to decline 14% this year, then rebound to a 42% gain in 2020. They see Alphabet's earnings rising 7% in 2019 and 17% in 2020. Estimates for Apple are for a 9% increase in fiscal 2020 (ending next September) and a 14% increase in the next fiscal year.

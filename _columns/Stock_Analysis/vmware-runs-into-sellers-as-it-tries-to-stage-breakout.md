Software virtualization company **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) tried to break out of a base on Wednesday but faltered.

  

The stock had begun correcting in mid-January 1 and sank as much as 24% before recovering. VMware had made only moderate gains from its earlier base 2, making this a base-on-base formation.

  

VMware appeared to break out April 20 as shares burst higher in huge volume after the company's quarterly profit report 3. Yet VMware stalled and formed a five-week consolidation 4.

  

A chart reader can make different interpretations. The most reasonable is that the five-week consolidation was a high handle. Another interpretation is that the handle was actually a flat base, making the pattern a base on base.

  

Either way, the buy point was 99.29 and VMware surpassed that level in heavy trading.

  

But as the day wore on and more selling built up in the market, VMware faded. Shares closed below the buy point â€” a bad sign.

  

Shares so far are 3% from the buy point, so investors who bought at the buy point don't have much of a loss. Still, the weak market calls for cautious investing.

 Even before Wednesday's market sell-off over worries about Donald Trump's presidency, Big Oil and gas stocks like **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) were struggling.
Fellow energy play **Antero Midstream Partners** ([AM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AM)) was showing stronger technical action, but it also sprung a leak as the [Dow Jones industrial average](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis/) and the S&P 500 crashed below their 50-day moving averages.


While the indexes are showing signs of resilience and a possible rebound, it's not yet clear if Exxon, Halliburton and other oil giants will climb higher — or if Antero Midstream can finish the base it's forming and pump out a new breakout.


154% Earnings Growth
--------------------


Based in Denver, Antero owns and operates shale energy assets in West Virginia and Ohio.


It's been a profitable venture for the 2014 IPO, which has generated a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 154% and average annual revenue gains of 89% during the same period. Antero pays a dividend currently yielding 3.6%, and sports a 43% pretax profit margin and 22% return on equity.


While the stock's Accumulation-Distribution Rating slipped to a C in recent days, Antero's strong fundamentals have attracted institutional demand, helping drive three straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Is A Breakout In The Pipeline?
------------------------------


Antero is working on a flat base as part of a base-on-base pattern. The buy point is 35.84.


Although the stock was down nearly 2% Thursday, it did manage to find support at its 50-day line and closed above that benchmark on Friday.



Be sure to keep a close eye on [current market trends](http://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), and see if the indexes and leading stocks can regain their footing and bounce back from Wednesday's sell-off.


While it's difficult for any one stock to buck the overall market trend, Antero's proven track record of profitability may pump up its stock to new heights when a more favorable stock environment returns.

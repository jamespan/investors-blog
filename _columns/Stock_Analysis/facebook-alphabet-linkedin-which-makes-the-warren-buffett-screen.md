Social media and Internet icons like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) continue to battle for monthly active users and mobile ad dollars.


But only one of these tech titans earns a spot on the [Warren Buffett Stock Screen](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/warren-buffett-stock-screen-which-names-make-the-list/), which looks for stocks that best match the investing strategy of the legendary **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) CEO.


Created by IBD sister firm [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), the screen reflects the Oracle of Omaha’s emphasis on companies with sound management and a solid track record, with a particular focus on annual and quarterly earnings per share growth, return on equity and profit margins.


Only Facebook Earns A ‘Like’
----------------------------


With rising earnings and sales growth in recent quarters and a five-year 51% annual EPS growth rate (and three-year rate of 71%), Facebook is the only social media stock that gets a passing grade based for Buffett’s stock-picking criteria.


The Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm’s 55.6% annual pretax profit margin also earns high marks, far surpassing industry rivals Alphabet (33%), LinkedIn (17.6%) and Twitter (7.7%).


Reading Between The Lines
-------------------------


Facebook’s chart offers important lessons on how to evaluate stocks in a down market by looking for signs of support and resistance at key moving averages.

Facebook kicked off 2016 by falling below the 10-week line but found support at its second line of defense, the 40-week moving average.


The stock bolted higher last month on earnings, then quickly pulled back as the market came under selling pressure. But large investors again stepped in to support the stock above the 40-week line and above its earlier 96.59 entry. The stock is now testing its 10-week line.


If Facebook continues to show resilience, it could be poised to resume its climb when a better market emerges.

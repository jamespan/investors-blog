Top-performing stocks tend to display certain characteristics just before they launch a new run, and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) shares many of those same traits right now. 


**Fast-Growing IPO:** The New Hampshire-based company went public in 2015 and has grown earnings at an annual rate of 41% over the last three years, with revenue rising at a 30% pace during the same period.


Planet Fitness owns and franchises over 1,100 "non-intimidating" fitness centers. It opened 48 new franchise stores in Q1 and said it’s on schedule to open a record number of new locations this year.


**Well-Run Industry Leader:** Planet Fitness is an efficiently managed company, with a a 26.6% annual pretax profit margin and an 81% return on equity -- nearly five times the 17% minimum ROE you look for. That helps the stock earn the No. 1 ranking within the Leisure-Services industry group, ahead of **Six Flags Entertainment** ([SIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIX)). 


**Strong Institutional Demand:**Strong and rising institutional demand is another trait Planet Fitness shares with past market winners. The stock currently sports a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.7 up/down volume ratio. Plus, the number of funds that own shares has risen in each quarter since the company had its IPO.

Even the heavy-volume down week, ended March 11, was actually a sign of support. Volume came in 138% above average, but the stock rebounded to close in the top half of the price range and right around the 10-week moving average.


Also note how the Relative Strength line has been trending higher in recent weeks, a sign of market leadership. 


The current buy point is 20.78, but the stock may form a handle to offer an earlier entry.

**BJ's Restaurants** ([BJRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJRI)) is in a third-stage base 1.

  

This is a late-stage pattern, which can can be more risky. By the time stocks get to their third base, they usually already have been on long, sharp advances. So there may be few buyers remaining. But right now though, BJ's seems to be working.

  

After breaking out of its latest base in April 2, the stock hit a new high. But the pressure of the market correction sent the stock to its 10-week moving average. Volume was initially heavy, but has tapered off 3. BJ's appears to be finding support at this key technical area.

  

With the market stuck in a correction, now is not the time to be buying stocks. Most stocks will fall along with the general market. But if the market uptrend does resume, then watch to see if the stock can lift off the 10-week moving average. Of course, you want to see it move up in above-average volume.

  

Buying a rebound off the 10-week line is a little tricky in the sense that there is no single buy point. Investors can buy anywhere in the buying range, which would be from the 10-week line itself and 5% above the peak before the pullback.

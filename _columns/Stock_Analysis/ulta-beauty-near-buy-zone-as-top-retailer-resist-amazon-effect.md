Just as **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) upended **Sears** ([SHLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLD)) and Kmart decades ago, competition with **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has been ugly for many retailers. But **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) has emerged relatively unblemished.


Jeff Bezos' e-commerce behemoth has drawn shoppers into its Amazon Prime ecosphere, leaving rival retailers like **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) struggling to maintain and expand their customer base.


But Ulta Beauty's business – selling beauty products and salon services – isn't as easily disrupted by online shopping and free shipping.


Shoppers, particularly first-time buyers, want to try the makeup and smell the perfume before they buy. Plus, Ulta continues to lure customers back into its 928 stores with its popular loyalty program.


Teens also represent a growing market for Ulta and rivals MAC and Sephora. Piper Jaffray reported that [beauty spending among teens is up 20%](https://www.investors.com/news/teens-spending-even-more-on-makeup-heres-how-investors-can-benefit/) from last year, with teenagers now devoting 11% of their annual spending on such products and services, up from 8.5% five years ago.


Funds Find Ulta Attractive
--------------------------


Ulta's growth has been solid and steady, with earnings rising between 22% and 39% over the last eight quarters. Revenue growth has come in between 19% and 24% during the same period.


Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), Franklin Growth ([FKGRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FKGRX)) and American Century All Cap Growth ([TWGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWGTX)).


Is Beauty In The Eye Of The Shareholder?
----------------------------------------


Ulta Beauty reset its base count in August 2015, and is now working on a second-stage cup pattern.


The current buy point is 278.73, but the stock may form a handle which could provide an earlier 268.88 entry. It takes five days to form a proper handle and Tuesday marks Day No. 3.



Due to a sharp sell-off in the left side of the base, Ulta's Up/Down Volume Ratio stands at 0.8, below the 1 or higher score that indicates demand.


But several weeks of tight closes in the bottom of the pattern, plus a nearly 10% gain last week in heavy volume show renewed interest in the stock. Also note how the stock is solidly back above its 10-week moving average and the Relative Strength line has been trending higher.


If Ulta Beauty continues to form a handle, look for volume to lighten up. And keep a close eye on general market conditions since making new buys in a weakening market increases your risk.

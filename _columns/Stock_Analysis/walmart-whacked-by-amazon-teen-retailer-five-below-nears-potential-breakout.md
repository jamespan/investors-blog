The **Walmar**t ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) vs. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) [battle for retail dominance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/walmart-vs-amazon-retail-stores-e-commerce/) continues to rage, with [Walmart's share price sinking recently](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-holiday-earnings-miss-sales-top-amid-fight-with-amazon/) on an earnings miss and disappointing e-commerce growth. But here's one retailer that has so far proved immune to the Amazon Effect: **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)).









 
 
 Amazon's stock has been rising sharply since a breakout in April 2015, boosted by its dominance in online retail and leadership in cloud-computing services, as well as new forays into [groceries](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-will-now-deliver-whole-foods-groceries-to-your-house-in-two-hours/) and [health care](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/fear-of-amazon-health-care-disruption-clashes-with-this-reality/), .
Walmart rose as much as 34% from a breakout last October, but the stock has now given back much of that gain.


Meanwhile, Five Below has continued to grow, posting three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including an 80% spike for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which ended Oct. 28. Sales growth has been strong and steady, ranging from 18% to 29% over the last eight reports.


[Amazon's "$10 & Under With Free Shipping" category](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/dollar-stores-in-expansion-mode-as-amazon-launches-under-10-category/), which was just recently and quietly launched, may pose a threat to Five Below and other discount retailers down the road.


No. 1-Ranked Discount Retailer
------------------------------


Based in Philadelphia, Five Below has over 600 stores in 32 states, offering teens and tweens products in their "Style, Room, Sports, Tech, Create, Party, Candy and Now" categories — all for under $5.


Five Below earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, tying it with **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) for the No. 1 ranking among its peers in the [discount retailers industry group](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/). **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) round out the top five.


Five Below sports a solid 25% return on equity and an 11.4% pretax profit margin, which tops its fellow industry leaders. Amazon (2.1%) and Walmart (4.2%) operate on much thinner margins.


Fashioning A New Base
---------------------


After a 36% run-up following a breakout in September, Five Below has pulled back and appears to be building a new, later-stage base.


It has retaken its 50-day moving average and its relative strength line has been trending higher, although it remains below new high ground.



Look for the 10-day moving average to get back above the longer-term 50-day line to confirm the stock's renewed technical strength.


On Friday, Five Below managed to close in positive territory with a fractional gain, putting it 8% shy of the potential 73.65 entry. Walmart was still about 8% below its 50-day line, while Amazon remains 24% above the 1,213.41 entry it cleared in January.

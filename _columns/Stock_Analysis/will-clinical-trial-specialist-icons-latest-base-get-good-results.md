Today we'll look at **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), an Irish provider of outsourced development services for the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device industries. They specialize in clinical research services.

  

Last month, Icon announced they would acquire Aptiv Solutions for $143.5 million. It's a leader in the design and execution of adaptive clinical trials for pharmaceutical and biotech firms. Although based in Virginia, Aptiv has a particularly strong presence in Japan.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• While Icon's earnings growth is no longer in the triple digits, it remains strong and edged slightly higher last quarter from 55% to 56%.

  

• Sales growth has been trending lower over the last three quarters, slowing from 19% to 15% in Q4. The acquisition of Aptiv Solutions may help boost top line growth going forward.

  

• Icon is scheduled to release Q1 numbers on April 21.

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 21%, followed by a 14% gain in 2015.

  

• The company's 13% return on equity comes up short of the 17% minimum you'd prefer to see.

  

• Its -7% three-year annual growth rate is far below the 25%-50% pace you look for. But recent quarterly EPS growth has shown more strength.

  

• Icon's Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group has a solid 97 Group RS Rating, and the company's 97 Composite Rating ranks No. 4 among its industry peers.

  

• Icon has garnered strong institutional support, with a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

• The number of funds that own the stock has been rising in recent quarters, and three typically-better performing funds have a position in Icon: Allianz AGIC Opportunity C (POPCX), Wasatch Micro Cap (WMICX) , and Alger Small Cap Growth B (ALSCX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Icon's turnaround in earnings growth is reflected in its chart. After a nearly four-year slump, the stock came back to life around the same time it returned to profitability.

  

Its big run started with a breakout in July 2012 from a first-stage base.

  

It's been a relatively steady climb, with good support along the 10-week line for most of the run.

  

Although Icon has formed multiple consolidations along the way, those recent patterns actually count as one long, 2nd-stage base-on-base formation. That's because after each breakout, the stock began forming the next pattern before rising at least 20% from the prior buy point.

  

So its current flat base is considered a second-stage consolidation.

  

As the overall market came under pressure last month, Icon also pulled back, but found support at its 10-week line.

  

As you like to see, the Relative Strength Line is near new high ground.

  

The ideal buy point is 50.10, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

Watch to see if Icon can break past that price point on volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal.

  

Keep in mind that the company is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on April 21.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-icon-plc-iclr.aspx) shows the company's 97 Composite Rating is No.4 among the 25 stocks in its Medical - Research Equipment/Services industry group.

  

The group currently ranks No. 7 among the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.

  

Its 74 EPS Rating ranks No. 9 within the group.

  

Its SMR Rating of B ranks No. 5, while its Relative Strength Rating of 85 is No. 11 among its peers.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a B, indicating moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

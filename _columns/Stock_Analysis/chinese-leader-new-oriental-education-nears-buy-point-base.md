Update: As of the close on Friday Sept. 27, New Oriental Education stock fell 4.51% on a report saying the White House is considering limiting investment in China. The buy point still remains the same at 115.98.


**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) sold off Friday but is still setting up in a base. New Oriental stock's current uptrend is driven in part by its top-grade fundamentals: a near perfect IBD Composite Rating of 98, an EPS Rating of 90, an A SMR Rating, and an RS Rating of 97 at new highs, all signaling intrinsic strength in the stock. 




With sturdy fundamentals behind it, New Oriental Education stock is forming an ascending base with a 115.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Long story short, shares could break out despite Friday's tumble.


Strong Fundamentals
-------------------


New Oriental Education is the largest provider of private educational services in China, serving more than 8 million students through its network of 95 schools. 


Currently, education stocks are performing well across the board. Of the 197 industries that IBD ranks, the Consumer Services Education group ranks No. 26, with New Oriental holding the No. 2 spot in the group. 


While investing in a stock close to its earnings entails higher risk, New Oriental Education still has positive indicators for longer term growth beyond the Oct. 22 earnings report. 


On a fundamental level, the IBD Stock Checkup tool shows New Oriental Education stock averaged 20% earnings growth and 30% sales growth the past three years. Though New Oriental earnings growth has decelerated in recent quarters, from 56% to 21% and 9%, analysts estimate the stock's earnings growth will return to prior double-digit levels. Analysts see New Oriental earnings rising 32% in 2020 and 31% in 2021.


New Oriental Stock Chart Pattern
--------------------------------


New Oriental shares erased gains for the week with Friday's slide. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/) is trading just shy of a new 52-week high, a positive signal because the RS line measures the stock's performance against the S&P 500. 


The key breakout signal of this set up is the [ascending base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) formed over the last three months. Ascending bases are usually a product of an upward trending stock in a downward trending market. These patterns have three 10% to 20% pullbacks that occur as the stock is met with downward pressure of the overall market. 


The stock therefore pulls back in price and builds a back-and-fourth price consolidation on top of the previous base. Meanwhile the general market averages keep making new lows. But once the stock reproaches and crosses the high of the third pullback, a breakout follows. 


As EDU nears its 115.98 buy point, see if the stock's strong fundamentals and ascending base pattern trigger a spike higher.

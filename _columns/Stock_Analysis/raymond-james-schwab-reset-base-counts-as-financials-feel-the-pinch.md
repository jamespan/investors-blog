As the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) run into selling pressure, financial firms **Raymond James Financial** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)) and **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) feel the pinch of current technical, macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. But in what could become a silver lining following recent pullbacks, both stocks are forming new [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) after [resetting their base counts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).




Raymond James made last month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-apple-nvidia-microsoft/), joining industry peers Charles Schwab, **Houlihan Lokey** ([HLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLI)), **Stifel Financial** ([SF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SF)), **Ameriprise** ([AMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMP)) and **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)).


In a show of continued institutional support, Raymond James, Schwab and Ameriprise also made the list for [April's list of new buys by top funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-report-apple-googl-microsoft-under-pressure-while-vertex-lilly-weather-market-storm/).


The investment banks and brokers industry currently ranks a lowly No. 126 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. The Financial Select Sector SPDF ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)), of which SCHW stock is among the top 10 holdings, reflects that weakness. The [XLF ETF](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/xlf/holdings) now trades below its [50-day and 200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


Raymond James has shown more resilience, remaining above both benchmark lines, now finding support at its [50-day average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Schwab has retreated below its 50-day line but found support at the longer-term 200-day moving average.

Raymond James Delivers 79% Average EPS Growth
---------------------------------------------


Established in 1962 and a public company since 1983, Raymond James is a leading financial services firm for individuals, corporations and municipalities. Headquartered in Florida, the company offers service for private client, capital markets, asset management,  and banking sectors. It has roughly 8,700 financial advisors, with total client assets of $1.24 trillion.


Although earnings growth has slowed the last two quarters, Raymond James has posted average EPS gains of 79% in the last three quarterly reports. Revenue growth has been solid and steady, ranging from 25% to 34% during the same period. The company reports earnings on April 27.


In [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-raymond-james-financial-rjf.aspx), the company sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


RJF stock was featured in this column on [Dec. 31](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/charles-schwab-peer-raymond-james-looks-to-bankroll-breakout-with-1-billion-buyback/) after announcing a [stock buyback of up to $1 billion](https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/12/02/raymond-james-financial-raises-quarterly-dividend-approves-share-repurchase-authorization).


Last month, [Raymond James announced the acquisition of SumRidge Partners](https://www.raymondjames.com/news-and-media/press-releases/2022/03/28/raymond-james-financial-to-acquire-sumridge-partners), a top-ranked, technology-driven fixed income market maker. SumRidge specializes in investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds and institutional preferred securities. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory and other closing conditions.


Will Fresh Base Counts Set Up New Runs For These Financials?
------------------------------------------------------------


Both Raymond James and Schwab have recently reset their base counts by undercutting the lows in their prior patterns. Like a restart button, that gives both stocks a chance to launch fresh runs — if the general market cooperates.


Raymond James is working on a first-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 114.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has dipped. Look for that line to climb near a 52-week high to confirm its market leadership.


The RS line for Schwab has slipped even lower as the stock tries to save its own first-stage base with a 93.26 entry.


If the indexes are able to shake off the current volatility, look for Raymond James and Charles Schwab to finish their consolidations and break out.

What do semiconductor stocks, the Super Bowl and Nick Jonas have in common? They all have ties to **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), a pioneer in treating people with diabetes. That has DXCM stock on the [IBD Stock Spotlight screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) as it pumps up a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/).




Last year, the developer of continuous glucose monitoring systems addressed [then-pending CHIPS Act legislation](https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/news/chips). Dexcom wrote that "semiconductor technology enables our continuous glucose monitoring systems, helping the lives of more than a million people with diabetes around the world who depend on Dexcom CGM every day." President Joe Biden subsequently signed the bill into law in 2022.


In February, Dexcom teamed up on its [second-ever Super Bowl commercial](https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/g7-magic), starring multiplatinum recording artist and Dexcom sponsor Nick Jonas.


The campaign touted the [Dexcom G7](https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/g7-cgm-system), which enables people to manage diabetes without the need for pricking and fingersticks.  The CGM system delivers real-time glucose numbers to a smartphone or smartwatch.


Dexcom Pumps Up 113% Growth
---------------------------


Since 1999, Dexcom has been developing innovative technology transforming how people manage diabetes. Today, the San Diego, Calif.-based company has more than 8,000 employees around the world.


Earlier this week, Dexcom released a study showing the connection between [diabetes and mental health](https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2023/New-Study-Shows-That-84-of-People-With-Diabetes-Struggle-With-Mental-Health1/default.aspx) as Diabetes Awareness Week began in the United Kingdom. New research shows that 84% of people agree that having diabetes can negatively impact mental health. In light of the findings, Dexcom will host a free day of Puppy Yoga classes in London to promote mental health within the diabetes community


Sales growth for Dexcom remains solid and steady, ranging from 17% to 32% growth over the past eight quarters. On April 27, the company reported its [Q1 performance](https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2023/Dexcom-Reports-First-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx), posting an 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $741.5 million.


After several quarters of spotty bottom-line numbers, the company has bounced back in its last three reports. In the first quarter, Dexcom generated stellar earnings growth of 113% to 17 cents a share. The diabetes leader beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year guidance.


For Q2, analysts forecast 33% EPS growth and a 25% gain for the year.


With a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?), Dexcom ties **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN))  for top billing in the medical products [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-dexcom-dxcm.aspx). The industry ranks a solid No. 32 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Dexcom Stock Pokes At Buy Zone
------------------------------


Since October, Dexcom stock has formed multiple [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/) as it bumped its head against a line of resistance around the 122 mark. This week the stock punched through that ceiling in good strong and above-average [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). DXCM stock closed the week at the upper reaches of its buy zone after clearing the 126.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#flatbase).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has moved sideways as that pattern formed. That benchmark line has started to perk up and climb toward a new 52-week high.


This new move follows a string of heavy-volume up days since the end of last month. Dexcom rose nearly 5% for the week.

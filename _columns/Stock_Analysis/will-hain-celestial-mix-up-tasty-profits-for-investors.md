Healthy food can be profitable as we'll see today with **Hain Celestial**  ([HAIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAIN)), which is the nation's top supplier of natural and organic foods and personal care products.

  

You might be familiar with some of its brands, which include Celestial Seasonings, Spectrum Naturals and Health Valley.

  

And as an April 26 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/042613-653694-hain-celestial-strong-earnings-growth.htm) noted, the company has a long track record of pretty solid earning and sales growth.

  

But the better-for-you foods as a group have been under-performing. Still analysts see plenty of growth potential in the natural and organic foods segment.

  

The company has made nearly 30 acquisitions since it was founded twenty years ago. Its strategy is to buy smaller entrepreneurial companies that are a good fit with Hain's business. And it uses its resources and expertise to manage and build the brands into even better performers.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Sales growth ranged from 21% to 25% the past four quarters.

  

• Earnings growth has cooled during the past two quarters and stood at 29% last quarter. Remember you like to see earnings growth of at least 25% .

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 32% in 2014 and 18% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-hain-celestial-group-hain.aspx) shows Hain scores the seventh highest Composite Rating in the Food-Packaged industry group.

  

**J.M. Smucker**  ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)) carries the group's highest overall rating. But its logged single-digit sales growth gains in recent quarters.

  

The industry group itself is ranked No. 110 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart above shows Hain has carved out a long cup-with-handle base.

  

To find the potential buy point in that type of pattern by adding 10 cents to the peak in the handle.

  

Watch to see if Hain can break out past that buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average. If that happens, it could give investors a chance to get on board.

**Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and wireless rival **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) showed resilience during the Brexit sell-off and have moved higher in the market rebound that followed.


AT&T and Verizon rank No. 1 and 2, respectively, within the integrated telecom services group, followed by **8x8** ([EGHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGHT)), **Consol Communications** ([CNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNSL)) and **IDT Corp.** ([IDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDT)).


After completing its $4.4 billion purchase of AOL last year, Verizon is among the bidders for **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) properties up for sale. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer failed to shed any new light on the status of the sale at the web portal's annual meeting on Thursday.


Industry watchers have speculated that [Verizon or AT&T may acquire radio spectrum](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dish-stock-downgraded-on-unlikely-spectrum-sale-downward-pressure/) from **Dish Network** ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)) for a hypothetical price tag of $30 billion. But MoffettNathanson Research doesn't expect either company -- or potential fellow buyers **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) -- to foot that bill.


On Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission released the [first-round results from the government spectrum auction](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/att-verizon-and-broadcasters-set-for-game-of-chicken-in-fcc-auction/) and said 126 megahertz of spectrum will be available in a second round of bidding. AT&T, Verizon, **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) and **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) are expected to participate, but the amount of spectrum available may be [more than bidders are willing to buy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/whats-at-stake-for-dish-comcast-att-verizon-in-long-tv-auction/).


Solid dividend yields for Verizon (4%) and AT&T (4.4%) have helped drive demand for the stocks, and both telecom titans also have healthy cash flow, with Verizon generating $7.62 per share in 2015 versus $5.65 for AT&T.


Dial 'B' For Breakout
---------------------


After closing higher for 10 of 11 weeks starting in January, Verizon pulled back to begin forming its current base.
Since finding a bottom in that consolidation in late May, the stock has been climbing steadily, reclaiming its 10-week moving average along the way.


After holding its ground while the market fell sharply on June 24 and 27, Verizon is now trading within a 54.59-57.32 buy range.

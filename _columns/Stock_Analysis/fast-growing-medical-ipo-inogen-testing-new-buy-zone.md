High-profile tech stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) were not the only names on IBD's list of [today's fast-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/). **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)), a 2014 medical IPO, also made the grade.
The California-based company earned a spot on the list with a five-year annual EPS growth rate of 114%, just behind Mobileye's 117%. Facebook saw its annual growth rate rise to 59% after reporting results for 2016 on Feb. 1.


Earnings Exam Ahead
-------------------


Inogen, whose name stands for innovation in oxygen therapy, makes portable oxygen concentrators for patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions.


It's scheduled to report Q4 earnings after the close on Feb. 28, with analysts expecting Q4 EPS growth to fall to -47% and full year 2016 growth to come in at just 11%.


But earnings growth is predicted to rebound to a 26% gain this year.


Inogen is a somewhat thinly-traded stock with an average daily volume of just 124,000 shares and an average daily dollar volume of around $8.5 million.


Signs of institutional interest in the stock include a 1.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio, B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a jump in fund ownership last quarter from 316 to 334.


Inogen's 92 Composite Rating earns it the No. 4 spot within the No. 86-ranked Medical-Products industry group, behind **NuVasive** ([NUVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUVA)), **Heska** ([HSKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSKA)) and **ICU Medical** ([ICUI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICUI)). **Merit Medical Systems** ([MMSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMSI)) rounds out the top five.


Breathing Life Into New Breakout?
---------------------------------


After several bumpy months following its IPO, Inogen more than doubled from a November 2014 breakout until peaking in September 2015.


The stock fell into a long and deep consolidation, then rebounded to make a good run in the second half of last year. It's now working on a shallow, cup-shaped base with a 69.46 entry.



Inogen briefly cleared that buy point on Tuesday before pulling back. On Wednesday, the stock found support at its short-term 10-day moving average and ended the day just fractionally below the entry.


But as the market ran into selling headwinds on Thursday, Inogen also retreated, slipping over 2% around midday. But volume on the pullback was light, and the stock rebounded to close the day just fractionally lower and right around its 10-day line.


With earnings due soon, signs of pressure in the indexes and consensus estimates calling for slowing growth, buying into a breakout attempt now could be risky.


But given its long-term record of solid profitability and a three-year annual sales growth rate of 41%, Inogen could be one to keep an eye on to see how it reports and how the market reacts next week.

While **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) tops all [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) in terms of market-capitalization weighting on the Nasdaq, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) holds the No. 2 spot — for now. But as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) looks to snatch that away and Microsoft takes a hit this week, [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) aims to hold that lead — and perhaps even make a run for the No. 1 spot.




Shares of Apple popped after the iPhone maker [narrowly beat Wall Street estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-fiscal-q2-2024-earnings/) and hiked its dividend. In addition to raising its quarterly dividend, Apple also increased its stock buyback plan.


While generating $90.8 billion for Q2 of fiscal 2024, the King of Cupertino delivered a slight 1% increase in earnings to $1.53 a share. For the full fiscal year, analysts forecast a 7% rise to $6.58 per share, followed by a 9% rise in fiscal 2025 to $7.20 a share.


Although [Apple](https://www.investors.com/news/apple-rivian-in-talks-for-partnership/), [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) and all of the other Magnificent Seven stocks did not make this month's list of [new buys by the top funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-broadcom-dethrones-nvidia/), signs of institutional demand in AAPL stock have emerged. Apple sports a strong 1.5 [up volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), which ties Nvidia, and a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/).


The Nasdaq initially fell sharply Friday but came off its lows to close essentially flat and above its 21-day line. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft also showed resilience to in the final hour of trading.

Clash Of The Tech Titans: Apple Vs. Nvidia
------------------------------------------


With a market cap of a little over $3 trillion, Microsoft leads the Magnificent Seven names. As of Thursday's close, it accounted for 9.4% of the market cap weighting on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.


Apple stock is next with a market cap of just over $2.93 trillion, rising to now account for 9% of the Nasdaq — not far behind Microsoft. As it continues to soar, Nvidia is hot on Apple's heels with a market cap of around $2.75 trillion, 8.4% of the Nasdaq.


With percentages based on Thursday's close, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) (6.5%), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) (5.7%), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) (3.6%) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) (1.7%) fill out the list. At 1.9%, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) has surpassed the struggling Tesla.


Apple Stock Nibbles At Buy Point While Nvidia Soars
---------------------------------------------------


While Nvidia looks to overtake Apple in the market-cap rankings and Apple looks to top Microsoft, the iPhone maker aims to hold and improve its standing with a new breakout.


After clearing a trendline entry at 187 earlier this month, Apple has crafted a new 192.73 buy point. Its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) remains below its 200-day line. But in a sign of rebounding technical strength, Apple's [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has shot back above the 200-day benchmark.


Rebounding off the day's lows on Friday, Apple managed to extend its win streak to five days. It closed the week just shy of the new entry at 192.38.


Apple plans to outline its AI strategy at its [Worldwide Developers Conference,](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-to-kick-off-june-10-with-keynote-address/) set to kick off on June 10. We'll see if the event, as well as a new [eye-tracking feature](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/), [redesigned iPad Air and new iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/the-redesigned-ipad-air-and-new-ipad-pro-are-available-today/), can help Apple hold its market-cap edge over Nvidia. But one Wall Street analyst said [iPhone unit sales are soft and underperforming](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-iphone-sales-weak-in-china-us/) the total smartphone market in the key regions of China and the U.S.


While still looking to topple Apple, Nvidia broke its streak of four consecutive gains with a more than a 3% drop Thursday. After rebounding somewhat toward the close on Friday, Nvidia ended with nearly a 3% gain for the week.


Meanwhile, Microsoft maintains its market-cap lead but failed to hold support at its 50-day line. After a sharp drop earlier in the day, shares of MSFT bounced back to end Friday's session in positive territory.

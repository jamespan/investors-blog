Four Quarters Of Rising EPS & Sales Growth
------------------------------------------


SVB Financial has shown four straight quarters of accelerating top and bottom line growth. During that time, earnings growth has risen from 13% to 53%, while sales gains have increased from 7% to 32%.


The company has a strong 38.8% annual pretax profit margin, but a less impressive 13.5% return on equity.


Can Investors Bank On A Breakout?
---------------------------------


Since the sudden, but short-lived sell-off in the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq in early February, SVB Financial has found support right along its 10-week moving average as it builds the right side of its current base.


In a sign of market leadership, its relative strength line jumped into new high ground Tuesday as the stock rose over 2%, pushing it into the 263.19 to 276.35 buy zone. Volume picked up in the afternoon, ending the day around 16% above average.

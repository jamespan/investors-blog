$1 Billion Buyback Plan Lifts Raymond James Financial
-----------------------------------------------------


Earlier this month, the board of Raymond James Financial authorized a [stock buyback of up to $1 billion](https://www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/12/02/raymond-james-financial-raises-quarterly-dividend-approves-share-repurchase-authorization). It replaces the previous repurchase authorization of $750 million announced on Dec. 3, 2020. As of Dec. 2 of this year, approximately $632 million remained.


After two quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, Raymond James posted a still strong 73% gain for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The company generated net revenue of $2.7 billion for the quarter and net income of $429 million, or $2.06 per share.


While analysts forecast a 3% slowdown in earnings growth for the current fiscal year, they see a 16% gain in fiscal 2023.


In a sign of solid institutional demand, Raymond Financial and Charles Schwab both made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-aapl-nvda-msft-googl-crm/).


Raymond James, Charles Schwab Test Breakouts, New Highs
-------------------------------------------------------


With 2022 just around the corner, Charles Schwab is testing a buy zone and Raymond James is looking for a fresh [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Raymond James has built a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 103.56 entry. The stock is above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) trying to tick higher.


Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is testing a new buy zone after initially clearing an 84.59 buy point on Dec. 16. Both stocks fell in the final market session of 2021.


But with the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) back in an uptrend, see if Raymond James and Charles Schwab can ride the [Santa Claus rally](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-how-much-money-can-you-make-on-the-santa-claus-rally/) into the New Year and beyond.

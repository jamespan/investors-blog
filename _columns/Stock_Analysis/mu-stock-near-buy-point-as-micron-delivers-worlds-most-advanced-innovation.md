With earnings due March 29, memory and storage solutions leader **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) has just delivered what it calls the "world's most advanced" data center. But selling pressure in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) has [MU stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-buy-now/) feeling the heat.




Micron posted average earnings growth of 143% over the last three quarters. Analysts expect the Boise, Idaho-based company to post a 101% EPS increase when it reports fiscal Q2 numbers. They see a 51% rise for the full fiscal year.


Sales growth has been solid and steady, ranging from 30% to 37% over the last four quarters.


After taking in roughly $867 million from top money managers in February, MU stock joined the billion-dollar club in this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-apple-nvidia-microsoft/), garnering an estimated $1.1 billion.


Fellow billion-dollar club members this month include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) ($2.4 billion) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) ($1.5 billion).

Micron Tops Industry Peers With New Launch
------------------------------------------


Helping to fuel the data economy, Micron powers advances in [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) and [5G](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/) applications. Through its Micron and Crucial brands, the company delivers a portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND and NOR memory and storage products.


Micron earns top billing in the data storage industry group with a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), although expect that to drop after today's decline.


On March 1, Micron delivered the [world's most advanced 176-layer NAND data center SSD](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-worlds-most-advanced-176-layer-nand-data-center), the first of its kind in the industry. The innovation offers wide capacity range and the broadest set of form factors available to meet the most demanding data center workloads.


With the launch, Jeremy Werner, general manager of Micron's Storage Business Unit, said its latest advance "delivers the world's most advanced NAND in a data center SSD well ahead of the industry."


MU Stock Gets Tested In Market Correction
-----------------------------------------


The best stocks tend to form bases during a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) as the [indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) try to rebound and launch a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). MU stock has been doing just that, although it has now encountered increased pressure.


Micron had been testing its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tool-50-day-moving-average/) as it works on a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 96.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Today's broad market sell-off has driven the stock below its 50-day line.


After slumping while forming its prior chart pattern, Micron's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) started to perk up but has again pulled back. The RS line is a key indicator to watch as investors search for stocks showing market-leading and rising strength as the general market regroups.


See if the indexes can regroup and reverse direction. And look for MU stock to come off its lows and retake its 50-day line as Micron gets ready to report earnings later this month.

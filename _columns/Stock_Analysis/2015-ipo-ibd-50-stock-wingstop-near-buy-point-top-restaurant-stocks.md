After getting grounded soon after its June 2015 IPO, Dallas -based restaurant chain **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) has now earned a spot on the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and may be getting ready to soar past a new buy point.


While the group ranking for restaurant stocks is a lowly No. 111, group leaders like **Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)), **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) and **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) have recently broken out.


On Wednesday, Wingstop and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) both cleared new buy points, but on volume that failed to hit the 40% or higher spike you prefer to see on the day of a breakout.


Taking Flight Internationally
-----------------------------


As of September, Wingstop had 949 locations, with 882 in the United States and the remainder in Mexico, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. 97% of Wingstop restaurants are run by franchisees.


In October, the company announced it will spice up its global expansion with 30 new franchise locations in Colombia and Panama to be opened over the next five years.


Wingstop recently raised its projections for 2016 new store openings to 145 to 155, up from 130 to 140.


In Q3, the company topped analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, but costs rose over 14%.


While Wingstop sports a strong 30% three-year annual EPS growth rate and 27.7% annual pretax profit margin, rising costs could be a concern if Q3's trend continues.


For 2016, analysts expect Wingstop to post a 21% increase in earnings, followed by a 14% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Two Telltale Weeks
------------------


Wingstop soared out of an [IPO Base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/) just five weeks after its initial public offering, but soon reversed to begin forming a yearlong base, which it broke out of in August.


It's current cup-with-handle is part of a first-stage base-on-base formation, with a 31.83 entry.


Although its chart shows two down weeks in huge volume within the base, dig a little deeper and the selling is not as bad as it looks.


The first down week, ended Nov. 4, came after Wingstop reported third-quarter earnings. But the stock quickly found a bottom and began climbing to build the right side of its base in rising and above-average volume.


The second down week, ended Dec. 2, was actually a sign of support, as the stock stayed above the 10-week line and rebounded to close in the upper half of the price range. Wingstop's 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership are also indicators of institutional support.


The buy zone extends to 33.42, but given recent seesaw action in the market, proceed with caution and be ready to exercise good sell rules for any stocks you buy.

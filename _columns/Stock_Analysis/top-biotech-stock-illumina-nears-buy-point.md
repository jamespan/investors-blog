As the medical sector continues to show strength, biotech stock **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) could be getting ready to break out. The San Diego-based firm is a global leader in genomics, providing researchers with the tools to conduct large-scale analysis of genetic variations.

  

Like Big Pharma leaders **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) — which was also recently featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/052815-754599-drugmaker-stock-abbvie-tests-new-buy-point-after-buying-pharmacyclics.aspx) — and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), Illumina is one of several medical-sector stocks on the [IBD Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Illumina's revenue gains have ranged from 23% to 35% over the past eight quarters, while its earnings growth has come in between 71% and 93% in the last three reports.

  

In Q1, Illumina's earnings per share of 91 cents blew away the consensus estimate of 72 cents.

  

The company has a strong 27% return on equity and solid 25% annual EPS growth rate, helping it earn a 97 Composite Rating.

  

Institutional demand is reflected in the stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 up/down volume ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In April 2013, Illumina launched a huge run and rose over 200% in less than a year. Then in February 2014, it began to run out of steam and entered an extended slump.

  

But the tide may be turning with the stock's latest consolidation.

  

Illumina has shown signs of institutional buying in the right side of the pattern, and its relative strength line is near new high ground.

  

The buy point is 213.43, 10 cents above the peak on the left of the pattern. See if Illumina can punch through that entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

As self-driving car technology leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) continues its climb, **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)) has just bolted past a new buy zone as it helps drive another type of Internet of Things (IoT) revolution: smart homes.









 
 
  From a breakout in March 2016, Nvidia soared over 400% in just 15 months. The chip designer, which has partnerships with a wide range of carmakers including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Toyota** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), **Honda** ([HMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMC)) and  China's **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), found support at its 10-week line after a brief pullback and has revved higher in recent days, including a gain of over 4% on Wednesday.
Like Nvidia, Control4 is on the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and is also a leader in its own industry, and was just named the top home automation provider in the 2017 CE Pro Top 100 Brand Analysis for the third straight year.


Founded in 2003, the Salt Lake City-based company's automation and control systems allow users to seamlessly monitor and manage TVs, audio systems and electronic devices, as well as energy, lighting and security systems.


Control4's customizable platform is compatible with off-the-shelf home automation devices from **Sony** ([SNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNE)), the Echo from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Nest smart home products from Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


No. 1 Stock In Highly Ranked Industry
-------------------------------------


With the highest possible 99 Composite Rating, Control4 holds the No. 1 slot within the No. 24-ranked Computer Software-Education/Media industry group.


**Instructure** ([INST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INST)), **2U** ([TWOU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWOU)), **Rosetta Stone** ([RST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RST)) and **TiVo** ([TIVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIVO)) round out the top five.


While Control4 has posted average EPS growth of 209% over the last three quarters, analysts expect earnings to be flat in Q2 when the company reports in early August. But estimates for the full year (13%) and 2018 (15%) have both been revised higher.


Strong institutional demand for the stock is reflected in an A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio and six quarters of rising fund ownership.


Programming New Breakout?
-------------------------


When this story was originally published on Tuesday, Control4 had just gained 3% in rising volume, bringing the stock within 2% of a 21.29 buy point.


In a sign of market leadership, the relative strength line had climbed into new high ground ahead of the potential breakout.


On Wednesday, the stock soared over 10% in volume more than 300% above average to close the day 7% above the buy point. The relative strength line jumped into new high ground. Once a stock is more than 5% above the initial entry, it's considered extended.



While Wednesday's action shows solid market leadership, keep in mind that the stock has already made a substantial move in recent months and the current flat base is a third-stage pattern. Such later-stage bases are more prone to failure than first- or second-stage formations, so have solid [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) just in case.


But later-stage patterns can lead to nice gains, and the combination of strong fundamentals, market-leading technical action and solid institutional demand could mean Control4 is set to keep climbing higher.

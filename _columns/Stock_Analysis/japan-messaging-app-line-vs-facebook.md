Armed with Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and its own namesake platform, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is the undisputed king of social media -- except in certain parts of Asia.


Japan-based messaging service **Line** ([LN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LN)), which had its U.S. IPO in July, dominates in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.


The big question now is, can Line translate that regional popularity into global expansion?


Growing Or Slowing?
-------------------


While the company's mission statement focuses on "closing the distance" between people and cultures, its biggest challenge will be to close the global user gap it has with Facebook, Snapchat and other social media rivals.


As of April, Line had 218 million monthly active users -- a number dwarfed by Facebook-owned properties WhatsApp (over 1 billion users) and Messenger (over 900 million). Last year, Line's monthly active users grew less than 1% over 2014.


While user growth was essentially flat, last year's sales grew 40% to approximately $1.1 billion. As [Bloomberg reported](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-07/line-plans-year-s-biggest-tech-ipo-with-pitch-to-u-s-investors), Line's Q1 revenue rose 29% and was comprised primarily of ad sales (35%), smartphone games and other content (35%), and digital stickers and other communications-related products (22%).


First-quarter earnings rose 186%. Line has not yet set a date for its Q2 report, its first since going public.


Forming IPO Base
----------------


Like Facebook following its IPO in 2013, Line quickly headed south after going public five weeks ago. But the stock appears to be finding its footing and is now working on an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) with a 44.59 entry.


Buying brand-new IPOs can be risky. And not knowing when Line will report Q2 numbers or what type of performance it will post, adds to the uncertainty.


But early-stage breakouts can also lead to powerful gains, as **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), then known as Google, proved back in 2004.


In early trading Tuesday, Line gapped up over 4%, with its Relative Strength line jumping into new high ground.


See if Line can report a strong debut quarter and clear its buy point in heavy volume.

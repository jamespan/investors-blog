As the No. 1-ranked clinical research organization (CRO), **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) tops industry peers **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) and **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)).




The medical research industry ranks a middling No. 85 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks while Icon leads with a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). In [Stock Checkup,](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-icon-plc-iclr.aspx) Medpace and lab equipment provider **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) tie for second place in the industry group with a 91 rating. [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) Charles River Labs — after falling through its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) to a test of its 200-day level — still holds an 85 Composite Rating.


Icon stock has pulled back to test support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tool-50-day-moving-average/).


Icon Sees Accelerating Sales Growth As CRO Network Expands
----------------------------------------------------------


Earlier this month, Icon announced that its [Accellacare Site Network](https://investor.iconplc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/icon-announces-expansion-its-accellacare-site-network) has expanded through new partnerships with six research sites across four countries.


Headquartered in Ireland, Icon is already a global provider of drug development and commercialization services to [pharmaceutical](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), [biotechnology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), [medical device](https://www.investors.com/tag/medical-products/) and government organizations.


The broadening of the Accellacare Site Network increases access to investigative sites and patients, supporting faster recruitment and reduces the overall time and cost of drug development for customers, the company says. With the expansion, Accellacare now has access to more than 9 million patients.


Sales growth for Icon has accelerated in recent quarters, from an 11% decline in Q2 of 2020 to a 166% increase in the third quarter of this year.


Earnings growth has ranged from 21% to 77% over the last three quarters. Analysts expect a 41% rise in revenue for the full year and a 19% gain in 2022, according to IBD's Stock Checkup.


While Icon did not join Charles River Labs and Medpace on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-on-tech-stocks-nvidia-salesforce-microsoft-google-netflix/), it has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Some 167 funds with an A or better rating from IBD now own shares in ICLR stock, which also sports an [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/) of 1.3 — suggesting upward price pressure on the shares.


ICLR Stock Tests Support For New Breakout
-----------------------------------------


Icon joins several other leading CRO and other stocks in the medical research industry in testing various moving averages. As noted earlier, on a daily chart, Charles River Labs is testing support at its 200-day. On a weekly chart, it is testing its 40-week line. Medpace has been retreating from a [heavy-volume gap-up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gaps-signal-unusual-strength-buy-stock-market-leaders/) on earnings on Oct. 26, but remains above its 50-day line.


Meanwhile, both Icon and PerkinElmer are testing support at their 50-day benchmarks.


PerkinElmer is testing that moving average after breaking out of a somewhat awkward [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). After briefly clearing the 182.99 buy point in mid-November, the stock gave back those modest gains, falling below the entry as it retreated to its 50-day line.


Icon continues to work on a consolidation showing a 301.82 buy point. The pattern remains intact as the CRO leader tries to find its footing at its 50-day moving average.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has pulled off the highs it hit in late September. Look for the RS line to trend higher again as Icon tries to shore up support and breakout in strong volume.

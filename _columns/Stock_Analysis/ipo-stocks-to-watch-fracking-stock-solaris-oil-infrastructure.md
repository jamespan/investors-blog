IPO Stocks To Watch: Explosive Earnings
---------------------------------------


Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure has been showing triple-digit top- and bottom-line growth. The Houston-based company has delivered revenue gains ranging from 105% to 349% over the last seven quarters.


Earnings growth has averaged 1,206% over the last three quarters. Solaris earned a spot on IBD's latest list of [stocks expecting 50%-plus EPS growth in Q3](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-analyst-estimates-eps-growth/). Analysts are expecting 285% growth when the fracking leader reports on Oct. 31.


Solaris also made the most recent list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/).


With a 97 Composite Rating, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure earns the No. 1 spot among its peers in the specialty chemicals industry group.


Signs of institutional demand for shares include a 1.2 up/down volume ratio and rising fund ownership in the latest quarter. Plus, 27 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-cvs-lowes-biogen-union-pacific/) with an A+ rating have reported a position in the fracking stock.


IPO Stocks To Watch: Base In Progress?
--------------------------------------


After closing its first week of trading in May 2017 at 11.55, Solaris rose 107% before peaking in January. The stock found a bottom in July, and has been moving generally higher since then.


While Solaris has yet to establish a new buy point, it may be forming a [flat base or other chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) as the market corrects. The relative strength line remains well below new-high ground, but the 10-week line is moving back above the longer-term 40-week moving average â€” a sign of renewed technical strength.


While now is not the ideal time to buy any stock, with its exceptional earnings and sales growth, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure is one of the top [IPO stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) as we wait for a new market uptrend to begin.


On Monday, the stock posted its fourth straight of day of very tight price closes right around its 50-day line. Such behavior could mean Solaris is winding up a coil to spring higher down the road.


As the Nasdaq jumped nearly 3% Tuesday, Solaris added 1.7% to 17.74. Volume was well above average.

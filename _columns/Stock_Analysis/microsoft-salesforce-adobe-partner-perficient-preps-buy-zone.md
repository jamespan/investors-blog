As one of the drivers of enterprise-wide digital transformations, **Perficient** ([PRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRFT)) has partnered with fellow leaders in the AI and cloud space, including **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)).


Earlier this month, Perficient announced it has integrated a platform called Sami with **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)). Sami is an [AI-enabled cybersecurity support agent](https://www.perficient.com/about/news-releases/2019/perficient-and-symantec-empower-customers-with-ai-enabled-self-service-support-agent), which Perficient says will reduce phone use and case abandonment, and enhances knowledge of customer behavior.


Perficient has also partnered with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). It has ties related to cloud services and Big Data through the e-commerce giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings.


Microsoft, Amazon Show Solid Demand
-----------------------------------


Perficient is expected to report earnings Nov. 7. The stock is currently trading around 2% away from a potential 39.84 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Analysts expect the St. Louis-based company to report 26% earnings growth in the current quarter. Average EPS growth over the last three quarters has come in at 29%.


You can see demand for the stock in its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


Is This The Next AI Breakout?
-----------------------------


Perficient has been moving steadily higher since breaking out from a cup with handle pattern in May. The [AI and cloud leader](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) has formed multiple bases since then, but each advance has been relatively modest. So it remains in a [first-stage consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


With earning due, the stock may be poised to punch through its recent [points of resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and finally start to launch a longer climb.


At the end of Friday's session, Perficient was giving back gains, but still in positive territory for the day.


Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce.com and several other Perficient partners are in the process of consolidating gains in hopes of a continued stock run.

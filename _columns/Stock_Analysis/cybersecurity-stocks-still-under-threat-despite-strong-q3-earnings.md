During an unforgiving earnings season in a weak market, even stocks that post solid quarterly EPS growth can run into resistance. Just ask cybersecurity firms like **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)), **Barracuda Networks** ([CUDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUDA)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)).


After topping Q3 estimates, Proofpoint, Barracuda Networks and Checkpoint initially jumped, but have since pulled back to varying degrees.


In a big day for cybersecurity stocks, Qualys, **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)), **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Imperva** ([IMPV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMPV)) and **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)) reported earnings on Thursday, with [all but Symantec posting solid beats](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/security-firms-symantec-fireeye-cyberark-imperva-earnings-on-tap/).


On Friday morning, FireEye was up over 14% and Imperva was also up. But Qualys was reversing sharply, CyberArk was essentially flat and Symantec was collapsing.


Bottom line: An earnings beat does not always lead to a sustained new run, even if it does generate an initial bump. That's especially true when the overall market is under pressure and the stock itself has lingering technical weakness, such as trading below its 50-day moving average.


Proofpoint Proves The Point
---------------------------


When Proofpoint beat Q3 estimates on Oct. 20, it spiked nearly 11% the next day in heavy volume, pushing it back above its 50-day line. But the stock has since pulled back and is now trading below that benchmark moving average.



Yet, with two straight quarters of profits after a string of losses and sales gains that have ranged from 35% to 44% over the past eight reports, the provider of cloud-based security solutions for email and mobile apps is one to keep an eye on.


Fund managers have Proofpoint on their radar, as reflected in its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and two straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, two typically better-performing mutual funds own shares of Proofpoint, including T Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)).


But the current environment calls for caution and patience. Look for the market to rebound and for Proofpoint to complete its base and clear a 79.88 entry in heavy volume.

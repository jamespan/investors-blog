Eight stocks in the internet content industry group have the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)). **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) is just behind them with a 98 rating.









 
 
 The Composite Rating compares a stock's performance with that of all stocks in terms of the [most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). For example, Grubhub's score means it's outpacing 98% of all stocks.
While Autohome, Weibo and several other [top Chinese internet stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) have already climbed out of buy range, Grubhub has just popped into a new buy zone in a later-stage flat base. Facebook is still floating within buy range after clearing a 184.35 entry.


Solid Earnings & Sales Growth
-----------------------------


Grubhub is the nation's leading online and mobile food-delivery service, with a network of over 75,000 restaurants in more than 1,300 U.S. cities and London.


Mizuho just initiated coverage of Grubhub, with a price target of 81, saying the company will [benefit from rising interest in delivery services among big restaurant chains](https://www.morningstar.com/news/market-watch/TDJNMW_20180125206/grubhub-to-benefit-from-delivery-interest-among-big-restaurant-chains-analyst.html).


Spurred by a 26.4% annual pretax profit margin, Grubhub has been growing earnings at a 40% annual clip over the last three years. Revenue has been increasing at a 38% pace over the same period.


Grubhub is set to report Q4 numbers before the market open on Feb. 8. Analysts are looking for a 34% leap in earnings, which would mark a second-straight quarter of accelerating growth.


Signs of demand for the Chicago-based company include a 1.5 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership. T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)), which has an [A+ IBD mutual fund rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3105496), owns more than 4% of Grubhub's shares.


Later-Stage Pattern
-------------------


Grubhub was featured in the [June 21 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/this-tech-stock-nears-breakout-on-speculation-of-amazon-buyout/) just as it was breaking out on speculation that **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) would buy the company on the heels of the retail giant's purchase of Whole Foods Market.



While it turned out Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wasn't hungry enough to place that order, Grubhub delivered solid profits for investors who held the stock as it rose 59% until pulling back in December.


The [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose over 4% Friday to jump into a 74.91-78.66 buy zone in a third-stage flat base. Volume was more than 50% above average.


Keep in mind that later-stage patterns involve more risk, and while Grubhub and the general market may keep on climbing, be sure to have [defensive sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) just in case.

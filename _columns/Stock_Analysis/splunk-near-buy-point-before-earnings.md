The rise of cloud computing has been driving demand for big data analytics firms, including 2012 IPO **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)).


Like rival **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)), Splunk helps companies with what it calls Operational Intelligence or business intelligence â€” the process of digging through massive amounts of data to discover ways to make an organization more productive and profitable.


Splunk puts particular emphasis on machine data, which contains a comprehensive record of all the activity and behavior of a company's customers, users, transactions, applications, servers, networks and mobile devices.


**Key Fundamentals**


Earnings growth has been on the upswing in recent quarters, jumping to a 200% rise in the most recent report. Sales growth has been more consistently strong, ranging from 48% to 54% over the last eight quarters.


Splunk is expected to report its latest numbers on May 28.


For fiscal 2016, analysts expect earnings to rise 33%, followed by a 150% gain in fiscal 2017.


A weak point for Splunk is its 1% return on equity, which is one reason it has an 88 Composite Rating, below the 95 or higher score you'd prefer.


On the positive side, the number of funds with a position in the stock has risen significantly over the last two quarters.


**Chart Analysis**


After going public in 2012, Splunk got off to a bumpy start. But it launched a huge move in Feb. 2013 , essentially tripling in price in just one year.


The stock then sold off sharply for several months, but has recently been trying to rebound and is now working on a first-stage [base-on-base pattern](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/739182-how-to-read-stock-charts.htm).


The second half of that formation is a [cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787), showing a 69.75 buy point. Last Friday and again on Wednesday, the stock tried to clear that entry but hit resistance.


Volume on both days was above average, which points to institutional buying. Also, Splunk's Relative Strength line has been on the rise despite selling pressure in the general market.


While it's good to see that type of resilience, keep in mind that it's risky to make new buys during a market correction.


Also, with Splunk scheduled to release its latest numbers on May 28, remember that the current earnings season has not been a forgiving one.

As the use of prescription drugs continues to rise, the risks of conflicting medications, missed or inappropriate dosing, and other dangers also increase. Medication management leader **Omnicell** ([OMCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMCL)) looks to minimize those issues through its [Autonomous Pharmacy](https://www.omnicell.com/us/en_us/about-us/the-omnicell-story) roadmap. The company's innovative solutions are driving both profits and institutional demand for Omnicell stock.




The Silicon Valley-based medical systems firm posted a big spike in earnings growth last quarter, from 27% in Q4 to 110% in Q1. Revenue growth was less dramatic, but still jumped from 8% to 11%.


For the full year, analysts expect 33% EPS growth. They also expect a 7% gain in 2020. Analysts raised those estimates recently.

43 A+ Funds Own Omnicell Stock
------------------------------


Strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) is one of the [key traits of winning stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), and Omnicell certainly has it.


Omnicell stock has the highest-possible A+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/), which indicates heavy professional buying over the last 13 weeks. It also sports a solid 1.5 up/down volume ratio. While Omnicell didn't make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-ulta-facebook-paycom-paypal-veeva-microsoft/), it has posted four quarters of rising fund ownership.


Plus, 43 mutual funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported a position in the stock. These include two of the typically top-performing funds in the IBD Mutual Fund Index: Wasatch Microcap ([WMICX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMICX)) and Carillon Scout Small Cap ([UMBHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMBHX)).


With a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Omnicell holds the No. 1 spot among its industry peers in the No. 31-ranked medical systems and equipment industry group.


Omnicell Stock Rebounds And Joins Stock Spotlight Screen
--------------------------------------------------------


After breaking out of a first-stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in February, Omnicell began pulling back toward its 50-day moving average in early March. It initially [found support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) at that benchmark line, but crashed below it on April 16, followed by an even steeper decline in heavy volume the next day.


But Omnicell found support at its second line of defense — the 200-day moving average. Over the next two weeks, the stock bounced off that line in heavy volume and climbed back above its 50-day moving average. Since then, the stock has continued to trade right along that line. Such behavior is a positive sign of institutional support.


Since early May, note how the shorter-term 10-day moving average has remained above the longer-term 50-day line, another indicator of technical resilience.


Omnicell fell 1.7% Friday to close at 81.03, 7% below an 86.97 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and just below its 10-day line. Volume was well below average.


More aggressive investors might consider an earlier 84.51 entry, but should also keep the general market in mind.


While the indexes showed a nice move off the lows hit on June 3 and flashed a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on June 7, the nascent uptrend has been running into selling pressure. It may be best to make sure the indexes continue to climb, and wait for Omnicell stock to clear the 86.97 buy point in strong volume.

When you visit the website of discount retailer **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), you can browse a selection of off-price men’s and women’s clothing, accessories, home goods and more. But don’t bother pulling out your credit card: The Fortune 500 company with over 1,200 stores in 33 states doesn’t offer online shopping.


To ‘E’ Or Not To ‘E’?
---------------------


Rival **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) -- which owns the T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods chains -- shut down its online store for T.J. Maxx in 2005 and then relaunched it in 2013.


In February, discount shoe retailer **DSW** ([DSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSW)) announced it was acquiring off-price footwear and accessories retailer Ebuy Inc. to expand its online shopping footprint.


As [Forbes reported](http://www.forbes.com/sites/abegarver/2016/02/29/e-commerce-ma-all-eyes-shift-to-ross-stores-after-dsws-acquisition-of-ebuy-inc/?utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix#6addf978213b), that may mean Ross will make its own e-commerce acquisition and potentially spark a new catalyst for growth. See if the company addresses that issue when the retailer reports Q4 earnings after the close today.


But even without online shopping, analysts say [Ross is well-positioned to compete](https://www.investors.com/news/ross-kors-among-4-top-performing-ibd-50-retailers/) with **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and other e-tailers, partly by purchasing “packaway” inventory -- goods bought at low prices but often not put out for sale until months or years later.


Ross Stores earns the No. 2 ranking within the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, behind **Francesca’s Holdings** ([FRAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRAN)) but ahead of TJX, **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) and **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


Along with fellow discounters **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), Ross is also a member of the IBD 50 list of top stocks.

Testing Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings
-----------------------------------


Ross Stores reset its base count in November, making its current consolidation a first-stage pattern.

The stock cleared a 55.74 entry in January but flashed a heavy-volume reversal the following week. Since then the stock has found support at the 10-week line and recently posted three up weeks on above-average volume, which points to buying by fund managers and other large investors.


On Monday, the stock fell over 2% as volume jumped 97% above average, but it was rebounding during Tuesday's session, once again testing the 55.74 buy point.


If the company reports well and the stock retakes the entry in heavy volume, it could offer a buying opportunity.

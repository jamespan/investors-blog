What does **Marriott Vacations Worldwide** ([VAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VAC)) have in common with **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT))? Like its fellow travel-related stocks, analyst estimates for Marriott's 2018 earnings growth have recently been revised higher.









 
 
 Consensus analyst estimates call for an EPS increase of 18% next year for Marriott Vacations, and Southwest (27%), Delta (14%) and Hilton (22%) are also expected to deliver strong double-digit gains in 2018.
**Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)), the hotel giant from which Marriott Vacations Worldwide was born in 1984, also had its EPS estimates for next year raised to 16%.


Southwest and Delta have ridden those [good 2018 forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/2018-stock-market-outlook-what-to-watch-for-in-the-new-year/) to recent breakouts, and Marriott Vacations may be packing its bags for a new climb of its own.


Hilton and Marriott International have both made strong climbs from breakouts in September and touched all-time highs on Friday before easing back.


Rising Revenue, Impressive Earnings
-----------------------------------


Marriott Vacations sells vacation ownership properties, often referred to as timeshares, and manages over 65 resorts in North America, Europe and Asia. In 1992, Hilton launched rival companyÂ **Hilton Grand Vacations** ([HGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HGV)), which currently has 280,000 club members, compared with more than 400,000 for Marriott Vacations.


Marriott Vacations has posted EPS growth ranging from 40% to 65% over the past four quarters, while sales gains accelerated from 4% to 21% during the same period.


A 98 Composite Rating earns Marriott Vacations top billing in the leisure services industry group. Hilton Grand Vacations' 97 rating earns it the No. 3 ranking within the lodging industry group.


Destination: Breakout?
----------------------


Marriott Vacations is working on a flat base with a 143.63 buy point as part of a first-stage base-on-base formation.



A 1.7 up/down volume ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and four quarters of rising fund ownership point to strong institutional demand.


The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average and right around its prior buy point. It closed the final trading session of the year just under 6% below the entry.


Look for the Relative Strength line to reach new high ground and for Marriott Vacations to punch through the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

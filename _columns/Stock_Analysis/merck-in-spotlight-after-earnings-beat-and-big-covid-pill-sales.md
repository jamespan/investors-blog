Merck Takes Covid Pill Gains With A Grain Of Salt
-------------------------------------------------


Based in New Jersey, Merck develops drugs and treatments for diseases that threaten people and animals, including cancer, infectious diseases such as HIV and Ebola, and emerging animal diseases.


On April 28, the company released [Q1 results](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-first-quarter-2022-financial-results/), beating projections for the quarter. Earnings growth came in at 84%, while revenue rose 50%.


Less bullishly, the drugmaker cut its full-year sales guidance for Lagevrio to $5 billion to $5.5 billion. It had expected $5 billion to $6 billion in sales. Still, Merck sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


Merck expects its heart drugs to bolster sales to around $10 billion per year in the mid-2030s. That would help offset a likely decline from its biggest moneymaker, Keytruda. The cancer drug soon faces competition form generic rivals as patents expire.


MRK Stock Near Breakout In Early Stage Base
-------------------------------------------


As the stock market indexes search for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to reverse the [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) and spark a new uptrend, Merck is testing an 89.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). MRK stock briefly cleared that entry on April 29 before drifting back below it.


But Merck found support near its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) Wednesday, jumping off that line in below-average but rising volume. The stock closed the week just 1% from the buy point.


While the stock nears a potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and [new high](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/), note that Merck has faced long line of resistance around mid-80s price range since 2019.


For [income investors](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/), it's also worth mentioning that Merck pays a dividend, current yielding 3.1% on an annualized basis.

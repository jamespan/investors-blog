As the coronavirus news continues to sink the stock market, now is a time to avoid making new buys. But it's also a time to keep updating your list of stocks to watch, such as fast-growing Chinese education company **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)).




Sales growth for GSX has been stellar. The online education platform has generated quarterly revenue gains ranging from 234% to 441% over the last four reports.


From its IPO in June 2019 through Q4 2019, GSX stock saw 71 funds take a position, including 23 with an A+ rating.

Lessons In Online Education During Coronavirus Scare
----------------------------------------------------


Even before the emergence of the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), there was strong growth in the online education business. Chinese online learning services like GSX Techedu, **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **China Online Education** ([COE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COE)) have been posting impressive fundamentals. In terms of EPS growth, **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) has encountered deceleration in recent quarters, but revenue gains remain strong.


With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, online textbook and other educational services provider **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) and New Oriental Education share top billing in the No. 33-ranked educational services industry group.


GSX stock earns a 93 rating, meaning it's outperforming 93% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). GSX also sports a solid 37.7% return on equity with no significant debt, showing it's an efficiently run company.


As the coronavirus continues to spread, the appeal of remote online education in China, the United States and around the world is clear.


In a sharp market sell-off like we're currently seeing, virtually no stocks remain unscathed. But online education leaders like GSX, New Oriental Education, Chegg and China Online Education may be in a position to take off once the market rebounds.

GSX Stock Tries To Keep Ascending In Face Of Coronavirus
--------------------------------------------------------


No stock is immune to a sharp and continued downturn like we've seen on the coronavirus news. But GSX stock has been showing strength and resilience as it continues to work on an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-rare-ascending-base-pattern/).


Since going public in June 2019, GSX stock rose as much as 342% in just nine months before peaking in February. During its sharp run-up, the Chinese stock has consistently found support above its 10-week moving average, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) hitting a new high.


The current stock market environment is clearly more about defense than offense. But when the market is down, you want to keep an eye on stocks showing resilience and exceptional fundamental growth in a promising industry. GSX stock certainly fits that bill.


As the stock market rallied into the close Friday on President Trump's address, GSX stock jumped to a nearly 5% gain, bouncing above its 10-week line. As you wait for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to occur to mark the start of a potential new uptrend, note that head fakes are common after such a sharp sell-off. It will likely take time to establish new buying opportunities.

The Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, has been driving growth in health savings accounts (HSAs). And that means more business for **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)), one of America's largest HSA administrators.

  

Since ObamaCare requires employers to offer health insurance workers can afford, companies have been pairing tax-advantaged health savings accounts with high-deductible insurance plans that cost less than traditional HMO or PPO coverage.

  

As [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/051415-752667-healthequity-expands-health-savings-account-members.htm) noted, HealthEquity estimates HSA enrollment is growing about 20% a year, with around 17.5 million people currently signed up. HealthEquity had 1.4 million HSA members as of Jan. 31.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has been strong and steady, ranging from 31% to 48% in the last eight reports. The company has also posted two straight quarters of triple-digit earnings gains.

  

For the current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 31, 2016, analysts expect earnings to rise 67%, followed by a 43% gain in fiscal 2017.

  

HealthEquity earns a 93 Composite Rating and a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public last July, the stock formed a cup-shaped base and broke out in November. It rose just over 20% before flashing a bearish reversal, which triggered the start of a new base.

  

HealthEquity tried to break out again in April, but soon retreated and began working on a new formation.

  

The relative strength line has been trending higher. On Thursday, the stock cleared the 27.99 buy point during the session but closed just below it.

  

The [buying zone](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/689816-how-to-determine-a-stockand8217s-ideal-buy-point.aspx) is from 27.99 to 29.39. As of Friday's close, HealthEquity was slightly below the buy point.

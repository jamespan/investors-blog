Based in the Netherlands, leading network solutions provider **Interxion** ([INXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INXN)) has already partnered with cloud-computing giant **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)). Now it has just joined forces with **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) Cloud Services as it tests a new buy zone.




Last November, Interxion announced it had teamed up with Oracle to offer access to [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.interxion.com/news/2017/11/access-to-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-now-available-at-all-interxion-data-centres-via-cloud-connect/) across Interxion's European footprint, which includes 49 data centers serving over 1,600 customers in 11 countries.


By making its Frankfurt, Germany campus an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect location, Interxion can provide seamless and scalable access to Oracle Cloud to any client colocating their network and private IT environments in any Interxion data center.


On Tuesday, Interxion announced a similar [partnership with IBM](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/direct-access-ibm-cloud-services-080000784.html), which gives European clients direct access to IBM Cloud services via Interexion's Cloud Connect platform.


No. 1 Cloud Network Stock
-------------------------


Interxion has a 98 Composite Rating, earning it the No. 1 spot within the Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 12 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


**F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) and **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) hold the No. 2 and No. 3 rankings among all network solutions stocks.


Interxion has posted four straight quarters of improving earnings growth, rising from a 22% decline in the fourth quarter of 2016 to a 43% increase in Q4 of last year. Revenue gains have also been accelerating, jumping from 5% in Q1 2017 to 34% in the latest report.


Interxion's next earnings report isn't expected until late April or early May. Analysts are looking for a 31% rise in earnings.

Testing Cup-With-Handle Breakout
--------------------------------


Interxion rose as much as 64% from a breakout in early February 2017 before pulling back last month to form its current chart pattern, a second-stage cup with handle showing a 62.96 buy point.


During that run, Interxion displayed tight weekly closes and consistent support along its 10-week moving average, making it an easy stock to hold. Such chart action is a sign of institutional support, and that's further confirmed by Interxion's eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Interxion rose 2% Monday to close at 62.74, just shy of the buy point. Although it temporarily cleared the buy point Tuesday, the stock fell back below it as the major indexes reversed course and sold off. Volume for Interxion was below average, so see if the stock can bounce back, or at least hold its ground, as we wait to see how the general market will fare in the coming days.



While Oracle rose nearly 4% Monday, the stock is still reeling from a [huge sell-off last week](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-pounded-as-business-outlook-falls-short-cloud-transition-slows/) following a disappointing earnings report, and it fell 2.4% Tuesday. Akamai was down 2%, but remains in buy range. F5 Networks dropped 1.8% and is now testing support at its 50-day line.


IBM's stock has been lagging, and it fell 1% to slip back below its 200-day moving average.

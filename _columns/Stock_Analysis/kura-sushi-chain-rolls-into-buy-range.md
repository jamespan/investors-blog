Led by **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), **Cava Group** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) and **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)), restaurant stocks have served up tasty gains for investors. Meanwhile, **Kura Sushi USA** ([KRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRUS)) continues to offer a spicy run of its own, with analysts forecasting 156% earnings growth this year.




The restaurant group has climbed to the No. 11 spot out of the [197 industries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) IBD tracks. Showing the power of the industry, [Chipotle](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg.aspx), [Texas Roadhouse](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-texas-roadhouse-txrh.aspx), [Cava](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cava-group-cava.aspx) and [Shake Shack](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-shake-shack-cl-a-shak.aspx) all sport the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. Coffee leader **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), which sports a 97 rating and was just featured as the [IPO Stock Of The Week](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/dutch-bros-stock/), has just brewed a new breakout.


[Kura Sushi](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-kura-sushi-usa-krus.aspx) earns a seat at the table among these leaders with a 96. The rating shows that Kura Sushi currently outpaces 96% of all publicly traded companies in terms of the most important [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Showing strong demand for shares of the stock, Kura Sushi also sports a stellar 2.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/). Those scores put Kura Sushi in good company alongside industry peers like Cava, Chipotle, Texas Roadhouse and Shake Shack.


Only **Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)) (2.7) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) (2.5) join KRUS stock in sporting an up/down volume ratio of above 2. Where anything above 1.0 signals demand, all three of these restaurant stocks more than double that score.


Cava stock, which sports a strong 1.7 up/down volume ratio, earns an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Sweetgreen tops all restaurant stocks in terms of demand with the highest-possible A+ rating. The group's slew of A+ to B+ ratings show strong buying by institutional investors in these restaurant stocks over the trailing 13 weeks.

Fresh Revolution From Japan
---------------------------


Kura Sushi USA is a subsidiary of Kura Sushi, a Japan-based revolving sushi chain with more than 400 restaurants and 35 years of history.


Headquartered in Irvine, Calif., the goal of Kura Sushi USA is to serve authentic Japanese cuisine via a revolving sushi service model. Diners can grab plates of sushi as they roll past their tables in what is essentially a delivery system driven by conveyor belts.


Since opening its first location in Irvine, Kura Sushi has grown to become the largest revolving sushi chain in the U.S. with 59 locations and eight more on the way.


Kura Sushi has a long track record solid sales growth. Over the last six quarters, the company has produced revenue gains of 30% to 50%. On Jan. 4, the company released its performance for the [first quarter of fiscal 2024](https://ir.kurausa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kura-sushi-usa-announces-fiscal-first-quarter-2024-financial), ended Nov. 30. Sales rose 30% compared with the prior-year quarter, reaching $71.3 million.


Earnings growth has been more sporadic, but is on the rise. For the current fiscal year, analysts forecast 156% growth to 36 cents a share. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects 109% earnings growth to 75 cents a share for fiscal 2025.


Kura Sushi Stock Rolls Back Toward Record High
----------------------------------------------


While shares of Kura Sushi stock have done certainly been rocked as they rolled higher, the sushi chain now trades just shy of its all-time high.


At the end of January, Kura Sushi cleared a 97.91 handle buy point. After climbing to just over 108, the stock pulled back but found support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The bounce off that benchmark line offers a potential buying opportunity.


On Friday, KRUS stock rose 1.5%, rolling up more than a 4% gain for the week.


Meanwhile, fellow restaurant stocks Chipotle, Cava, Shake Shak, Texas Roadhouse and Dutch Bros continue to show strength.

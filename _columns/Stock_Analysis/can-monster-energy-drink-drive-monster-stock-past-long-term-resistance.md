The popular Monster Energy drink continues to drive steady growth for **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)). But can it push Monster stock past the long-term resistance it has been struggling to break through for over a year?




Since hitting a peak at the end of January 2018, Monster stock has looked like someone going through cycles of sugar highs followed by sugar crashes. The Corona, Calif.-based stock is now getting energized again as it tries to set up another breakout attempt.


Only time will tell if this third time is the charm, but institutional investors have been taking a sip of Monster's shares and could be ready to take a big gulp. After a dip in fund ownership in the fourth quarter, the number of funds with a position in Monster stock rose from 1,516 to 1,583 in Q1. Monster sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.3 up/down volume ratio, which indicates demand.

No. 1-Ranked Monster Stock Joins IBD Breakout Stocks Index
----------------------------------------------------------


In addition to being on both the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) lists, Monster also joined the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/category/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/) on May 7 while building its current base.


Beyond the flagship Monster Energy drink, the company also markets a range of energizing beverage brands, including Burn, Nos, Full Throttle, Relentless, and Predator.


Since 2015, Monster Beverage has had a strong and deep partnership with **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), giving it access to Coke's global distribution channels. The relationship helps Monster compete internationally with archrival Red Bull.


But trouble may be brewing. Coke has announced it's [launching Coca-Cola Energy and Coca-Cola Energy No Sugar](https://www.just-drinks.com/news/dispute-with-monster-beverage-corp-continues-as-coca-cola-readies-coke-energy_id128106.aspx). Monster Beverage is claiming such a move by Coca-Cola to enter the energy drink business violates the two companies' 2015 agreement.


Meanwhile, Monster stock remains the No. 1-ranked leader among nonalcoholic beverage makers, earning the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The group ranks No. 17 among the 197 industries IBD tracks. Coke stock  is tied with **Keurig Dr Pepper** ([KDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KDP)) for the No. 4 spot among its peers with an 89 Composite Rating.

Pop, Pop, Fizz, Fizz? Can Monster Stock Finally Clear Resistance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Since the end of January 2018, Monster has formed three bases. The first two failed to launch a successful new run, and the stock is now closing in on a 64.21 entry in its current [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


During this period, the stock has run into [resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) around the 65 to 70 mark multiple times.


On the positive side, Monster's current base is shallower and shorter than the prior two. The first consolidation was 29 weeks with a 32% decline, followed by a 27-week pattern with a 24% drop. The current formation is 10 weeks long with a 21% correction. It's positive to see a stock's chart action tighten up and give back less ground.


You can see another sign of rising technical strength in the moving averages. While forming its current cup with handle, the 50-day line climbed back above the longer-term cousin, the 200-day moving average. And at the beginning of this month, the 10-day line got back above both the 200- and 50-day benchmarks. Such action — where the shorter-term lines get back above the longer-term ones — shows improving technical health.


Note also that the relative strength line for the energy drink maker is rising and trying to reach a new 52-week high.


On Wednesday, it briefly and barely cleared the 64.21 entry, but closed the day below it. It ended the session just shy of the buy point at 64. Volume was below average, but rising.


Monster stock fell early Thursday as the [stock market sold off sharply](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), but it found support at and bounced off its 10-day line. On Friday, the stock managed to close the week above that short-term moving average, erasing morning losses to end the day with a 0.3% gain, just  1% below the buy point.


While it's best to avoid making any new buys in a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/), when the market rebounds, see if Monster stock can tap into the power of the Monster Energy drink to finally break out and clear long-term resistance, this time without the sugar crash that has followed its other breakout attempts.

As the health care industry makes headlines with a new partnership between **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), as well as [a new buyout](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/could-sanofis-ablynx-deal-spur-a-biopharma-buying-spree/) by drugmaker **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)), leading biotech stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is testing a new buy zone.


 On Tuesday, [Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan said they will create an independent company](https://www.investors.com/news/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-chase-team-up-on-health-care/) "that is free from profit-making incentives," one that will "address health care for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs."


On Monday, Sanofi announced it's buying Belgium-based **Ablynx** ([ABLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABLX)) for 3.9 billion euros ($4.8 billion), just one week after it said it was buying **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) spinoff Bioverativ for $11.6 billion.


Earlier this month, [Vertex received EU approval for Orkambi](http://investors.vrtx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1053915), a treatment for six- to 11-year-old children with cystic fibrosis, a rare disease that affects approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.


In December, Vertex also announced positive results from a [Phase III study of Kalydeco](http://investors.vrtx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1051054) to treat even younger (one- to two-year-old) cystic fibrosis patients.


Top-Ranked Biotech Stock
------------------------


With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Vertex shares top ranking among [biotech and biomed stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) with **Ligand Pharmacauticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) and **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)). Biogen is right behind them with a 98 rating.


From its headquarters in Boston's Innovation District, Vertex has generated average EPS growth of 210% over the last three quarters, including a 212% gain in Q3. Revenue has risen at an annual pace of 65% over the last three years.


The [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) stock, which is also on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/), is scheduled to report Q4 results on Jan. 31, with analysts looking for a 51% rise in earnings for Q4 and a 122% rise for all of 2017.


Signs of institutional demand have been mixed. The number of funds with a position in Vertex fell last quarter, but the stock sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.3 up/down volume ratio.


New Buy Point On Trial
----------------------


Vertex cleared an earlier, aggressive 163.74 entry on Jan. 23, then poked its head above a more traditional 167.95 buy point the next day. The stock has continued to float above and below the latter entry in recent days.



On Monday, Vertex fell more than 1% to slip back below the buy point in above-average trade. The announcement from Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan drove down health care stocks at the open Tuesday, and Vertex also fell.


But despite the big sell-off in the major indexes, Vertex fared relatively well, bouncing off its 10-day line to recoup most of the day's decline. The relative strength line remains below new-high ground, but managed to hold tight Tuesday in a sign of resilience.


Keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports, since an earnings miss could send the stock sharply lower. Also [keep a close eye on current market trends](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) to see if the indexes top and begin to decline or rebound and keep climbing.

Riding the continuing tsunami of artificial intelligence, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) soared back onto this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-netflix-cmg-aapl/). And while **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) disappeared from this screen in June, fellow defense, intelligence and [AI player](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) **Parsons** ([PSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSN)) stock remains on these savvy investors' radars as it explores a new breakout.




[Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/) has come on and off this elite screen this year. Both [Palantir](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/) and Parsons, on the other hand, landed on this list [every month this year](https://www.investors.com/tag/best-mutual-funds-buys-and-sells/) — until Parsons went AWOL in June.


As [Nvidia's stock value gets debated](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-value-debated-after-recent-decline/) but finds support after a recent rash of selling, Parsons and Palantir are both crafting new bases. On Thursday, Palantir stock popped nearly 5%, while Parsons came off earlier lows to gain just under 1%.


Friday's negative reversal on the Nasdaq dragged on Parsons and Nvidia, with both posting a small loss. Palantir managed to eke out small gains.

AI In Orbit: Parsons, Palantir Explore Buy Points
-------------------------------------------------


Parsons is working on a second-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) showing an 86.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). With the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) gaining steam, Parsons ended Thursday's action 4% below the buy point. With a slight dip on Friday, shares of PSN closed the week 5% shy of that mark. But Parsons rose over 4% for the week, closing in the upper half of the week's price range.


A [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) would mark an all-time high for Parsons, which had its initial public offering in 2019.


Parsons stock popped back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on June 18 and has continued to climb. The [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) stands poised to cross back above the longer-term 50-day line, which would signal another sign of rising technical strength.


Palantir was featured in this column on June 7 as it [targeted an early breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/palantir-stock-flashes-early-buy-point/) past a trend line entry around 24. Palantir stock has cleared that buy point as it now takes aim at an irregular entry in a third-stage base. The conventional buy point for the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is 27.50. Palantir may also investors an earlier entry at 26.57.

Today we'll look at **United Therapeutics**  ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)), which develops therapies to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, cancer and some of the most complicated viral diseases.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After a sharp decline in earnings growth for several quarters, the company posted a 41% gain in Q3. Sales growth, however, continued to move lower, slipping to 9% in the latest report.

  

But with a strong 29% return on equity and a 39.8% pre-tax profit margin, United Therapeutics still earns an A for its SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE as a whole.

  

The company also sports a solid three-year annual EPS growth rate of 74%, helping it earn a strong 98 Composite Rating.

  

The B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate institutional buying over the last 13 weeks, and the number of funds that own United Therapeutics rose nicely last quarter, from 587 to 632.

  

But the stock's 0.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio is below the 1 or higher score you'd prefer. See if that improves in coming days.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a relatively steady rise from March to December 2013, United Therapeutics started showing more volatile behavior.

  

In late December, it gapped up to close over 29% higher for the week. That came on news the FDA had approved the company's drug, Orenitram, to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. But that was followed by a 34-week long double bottom.

  

The stock bolted out of that base on August 29, when the company got a favorable decision in a patent infringement lawsuit related to its drug, Remodulin. Volume for the day was 794% above average.

  

After rising for a few weeks, the stock began forming its current consolidation. The buy point is 137.03, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

On Wednesday, the stock poked its head above that price, but pulled back to close below it. As of early Thursday morning it was still below the buy point, but had found support at its 10-week line.

  

Keep in mind that it's considered a third-stage base. While such later consolidations can lead to solid gains, they are riskier than first or second stage patterns.

  

Also, on Wednesday, the outlook in IBD's Market Pulse changed from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure," which means it's a time to proceed with caution and be extra careful about making any new buys.

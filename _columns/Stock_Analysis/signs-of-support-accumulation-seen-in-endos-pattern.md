Shares of **Endo Pharmaceuticals** ([ENDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENDP)) have been basing for eight weeks as they form the second part of a base-on-base pattern.

  

The stock broke out of a cup with handle on March 30 **1**. It shot up to a new high, then pulled back to its 10-week moving average **2**.

  

The drugmaker found support once again at that level the past couple of weeks **3**.

  

The broader picture shows Endo forming the second half of a potential base-on-base pattern. It's considered a base-on-base because the second consolidation began forming before the stock had gone up at least 20% from the buy point in the prior base.

  

The current consolidation is a flat base since the decline from top to bottom has been less than 15%.

  

Endo has not traded below the buy point from the March 30 breakout.

  

The potential buy point is 44.63, or 10 cents above the peak in the base **4**. Another logical buy point is at 42.89, based on a level of resistance within the pattern **5**.

  

After a bearish reversal the stock has gained ground in above-average volume **6** â€” an encouraging sign.

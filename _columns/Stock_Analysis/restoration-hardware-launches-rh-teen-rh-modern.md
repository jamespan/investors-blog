With the rollouts of RH Modern and RH Teen, upscale home furnishings retailer **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is trying to put the finishing touches on a new base.

  

But will selling pressure in the general market hold it back?

  

In August, [CEO Gary Friedman announced the launch of RH Teen](http://news.investors.com/business/091015-770515-restoration-hardware-beats-second-quarter-views-but-q3-guidance-light.htm), a new concept designed to fill the void in the market for high-end furniture, linens and home d√©cor for teenagers. The new product line has its own website, Source Book and dedicated retail space in Restoration's next-generation Design Galleries.

  

This fall, the Corte Madera, Calif.-based company will also launch the RH Modern line, which will showcase "carefully curated" furniture and design pieces with a "modernist aesthetic."

  

In addition to a new stand-alone RH Modern gallery in Los Angeles, the luxury retailer also plans to open four more Design Galleries this year.

  

Restoration Hardware's competitors include **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), **Ethan Allen Interiors** ([ETH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETH)) and Crate & Barrel.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

On Sept. 10, the company beat estimates for both earnings and sales. And CEO Friedman said the "sheer scope" of what they're launching this fall spurred Restoration to raise its guidance for the full fiscal year.

  

The company has a 16% return on equity and a 72% annual EPS growth rate, helping it earn a 95 Composite Rating.

  

As the stock continues to work on the right side of its base, look for improvement in the C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and see if the 0.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio can get above 1.0 to show rising demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Restoration Hardware's share price has more than tripled since the close of its IPO debut on Nov. 2, 2012. But it's been a bumpy ride, with the stock forming multiple bases along the way.

  

It's now working on a new consolidation that is part of a second-stage base-on-base formation.

  

After the company reported its latest earnings, shares shot higher to reclaim their 10-week moving average line. Volume for the week came in 117% above average, which points to buying by mutual fund managers and other professional investors.

  

Despite selling pressure in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the stock has so far managed to trade in a tight range with good support along the 10-week line.

  

That resilience is also reflected in the Relative Strength line, which has been trending near new high ground.

  

If selling pressure in the general market continues to rise, see if Restoration Hardware can continue to show strength.

  

The [buy point](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/689816-how-to-determine-a-stockand8217s-ideal-buy-point.aspx) in the base is 106.08, 10 cents above the peak on the left. If the stock goes on to form a handle, the entry would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

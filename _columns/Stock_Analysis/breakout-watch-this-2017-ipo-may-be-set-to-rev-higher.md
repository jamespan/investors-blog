 While initial gains from the **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) IPO disappeared as quickly as a Snapchat story, other 2017 initial public offerings, including that of **Rev Group** ([REV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REV)), are so far showing healthier market debuts.
Like **Presidio** ([PSDO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSDO)), **Schneider National** ([SNDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNDR)), **Invitation Homes** ([INVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVH)) and other fellow members of the class of 2017, Rev Group has held its ground better than Snap and is now forming an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/).


Such patterns can be risky given the limited trading history of the stock, but IPO bases can lead to significant gains, as Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) showed back in 2004.


Brazilian airline **Azul** ([AZUL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZUL)) and outerwear designer **Canadian Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)), are two more recent and profitable IPOs to keep an eye on to see if they set up initial bases.


Buying Spree
------------


Rev Group designs and manufactures specialty vehicles for the fire and emergency, commercial and recreational markets, including ambulances, recreational vehicles (RVs) and school buses.


The Milwaukee-based company aims to add to its roughly $2 billion in annual revenue with three acquisitions in less than five months, including custom RV and limousine maker Midwest Automotive Designs, Renegade RV and Ferrara Fire Apparatus.


Rev Group holds the No. 4 rank within the Building-Mobile/Manufacturing & RV group. **Cavco Industries** ([CVCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVCO)), **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), **LCI Industries** ([LCII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCII)) and **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) round out the top five.


The group sits at a lowly No. 125 among 197 industries, so look for that ranking to improve.


After quarterly earnings growth slowed from triple-digit gains to -5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, EPS rebounded to a 50% gain in fiscal 2017 Q1, ended Jan. 28.


Sales growth has ranged from 10% to 19% over the last four reports.


Fiscal Q2 numbers are expected around the end of May.


For this fiscal year, analysts expect 103% earnings growth, followed by a 34% gain in fiscal 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher, and analysts are looking for a 92% rise in EPS for the current quarter.


Since going public on January 27, 55 funds have taken a position in the stock, which currently has a 1.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


Breakout Ahead?
---------------


After pricing its IPO at 22, Rev Group moved higher for three weeks, then began forming its current base.


Although the stock has flashed seesaw action in recent days, it has held support at its 10-day line and trading on the weekly chart remains relatively tight. In a sign of market leadership, the relative strength line remains near new high ground.



On Thursday, the stock fell during the session but rebounded to close higher.


See if Rev Group can motor through the 29.39 buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.


As with any breakout, be sure to have [defensive sell rules](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettingStarted_SellingChecklist.pdf) in case the trade goes against you.

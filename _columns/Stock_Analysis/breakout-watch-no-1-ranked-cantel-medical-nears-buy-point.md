When hunting for the best stocks to put on your watch list, start with top-rated stocks that are near a potential buy point and are members of a top-ranked industry group. **Cantel Medical** ([CMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMD)) is one name that fits that bill.


The New Jersey-based company is the No. 1 stock within the Medical – Systems/Equipment industry group, ahead of **Cynosure** ([CYNO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYNO)), **Hill-Rom** ([HRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRC)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)).


The group ranks No. 17 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Top Funds Find Cantel 'Infectious'
----------------------------------


Cantel Medical develops devices and systems that prevent and control infections that can occur in hospitals and other medical settings. It focuses on three core areas: endoscopy, water purification and filtration, and health care disposables.


Demand for Cantel's products comes from the fact that over 2 million health care-associated infections occur in the U.S. each year, costing the health care system $33 billion annually.


To help grow its leadership position within each of its market segments, Cantel has made 28 acquisitions since 2000, including a 2011 buyout of Minntech, now  known as Medivators, which offers endoscopy and dialysis products.


Sales growth has been steady, ranging from 12% to 18% over the last eight quarters. For fiscal Q2, which ended Jan. 31, earnings growth slowed from 21% to 17%. Cantel doesn't report fiscal Q3 numbers until June.


For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 4%, followed by a 20% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


The stock's 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio points to institutional demand, and Cantel Medical made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-on-defense-with-reits-airlines-and-building-stocks/).


Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund (BCSIX), which was [the best-performing small-cap growth fund](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/small-cap-stocks-that-help-make-this-brown-capital-fund-top-notch/) with $100 million or more in assets over the last decade, has a substantial stake in Cantel Medical, which has a market cap of $2.8 billion.


Will Third Breakout Be The Charm?
---------------------------------


Since the current bull market cycle began in March 2009, Cantel has risen from around $6 per share to well over $60, forming multiple bases along the way.

After breaking out in October, the stock pulled back to form a cup-shaped pattern before rising at least 20%. It also failed to hit the 20% benchmark again when it broke out in March, making its most recent three consolidations all part of a first-stage base-on-base.


As the stock was forming the right side of the prior cup-shaped pattern, note how there were several days of above average volume, a sign of institutional buying.


Even two heavy-volume down days on Mar. 17 and 30 were actually positive signs of support. In both instances, the stock rebounded to close in the upper half of the price range and above the 10-day moving average. That showed investors stepped in to buy shares.


In recent days, Cantel Medical has found support at the 50-day line, which is also right around the buy point in the prior consolidation.


The new potential entry is 72.79, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if Cantel Medical can break out for a third time and launch at least a 20% gain.

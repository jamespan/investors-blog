Last month, Forbes released its annual [Fast Tech 25](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/forbes-ranks-veeva-fourth-fastest-110300970.html) list of the fastest-growing public tech companies, with **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) coming in at No. 4, behind **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


The provider of cloud-based sales and marketing software for the life sciences industry sports a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 46% and a three-year annual revenue growth rate of 47%. 


On May 26, Veeva is scheduled to report earnings for fiscal 2017 Q1, which ended April 30.


A Who’s Who Of Health Care
--------------------------


Founded in 2007 and based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Veeva has helped moved the global life sciences industry to the cloud with a range of offerings, including Commercial Cloud and R&D Cloud.


Its roster of over 400 clients, including **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Bayer** ([BAYRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAYRY)), **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)), **Mylan** ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)) and **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)), reads like a Who’s Who of the biotech, consumer health and pharmaceutical industries.


Veeva’s 93 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 spot within the medical software industry group, but the group itself ranks a lowly No. 183 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Enters Buy Zone Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------------


Just a week away from its next earnings report, Veeva has poked its head into a 28.05 to 29.45 buy zone, with its Relative Strength line climbing towards new high ground. 


Keep in mind that it’s risky to buy any stock just before it reports. Also note how Veeva has hit resistance around the $29 mark multiple times over the last year so that could happen again this time.


Volume is another key factor to watch. 


Veeva cleared the 28.05 entry on Tuesday, but pulled back to close above it in trading 37% higher than normal. On Wednesday, the stock moved back into the buy zone, but volume was 26% below average. You'd prefer to see lighter volume on down days and a heavy-volume spike on the day of a breakout. 


Early Thursday morning, Veeva Systems was moving higher and still within the buy zone.

UiPath Back On Growth Track
---------------------------


Soon after its IPO in April 2021, shares of UiPath entered a long and steep decline. But around the same time that PATH stock bottomed out in November 2022, the AI and RPA firm's fundamentals began to pick up — in a big way.


In Q3 of fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 31, 2022) and Q4 of fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 31, 2023), UiPath posted year-over-year earnings growth of 400% and 200%, respectively.


The company followed that with two more quarters of triple-digit EPS gains, although those percentage gains were based on prior-year quarters that showed a loss.


In UiPath's most recent report on Nov. 30 (for Q3 of fiscal 2024), the company generated earnings of 12 cents a share. That marked a 140% year-over-year increase.


Revenue for the quarter grew 24% to $325.9 million, marking a third quarter of accelerating growth.


That performance earns UiPath the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-uipath-path.aspx). PATH stock shares that honor with industry peers Palantir, ServiceNow, Salesforce and **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)), which [continues to leap higher](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/nvidia-stock-remains-king-but-jfrog-may-turn-into-a-prince/).


PATH Stock Bumpy, But Spiking Toward Buy Point
----------------------------------------------


On a daily chart, you can see how PATH stock gapped up in huge volume on Dec. 1 following its strong earnings report the prior evening.


After rising for several more days, UiPath pulled back to form its current base, an early stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). The new buy point is 26.52.


On Thursday, PATH stock rose nearly 4% in volume 32% above average. Building on that move, UiPath soared another 8% Friday in heavy trade as it its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) jumped. The stock now stands just 1% shy of the buy point.


PATH stock sports a strong A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and 1.7 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


As Palantir gains around 43% weekly gain in massive volume and industry peers like ServiceNow and Salesforce also hit record highs and flash institutional demand, see if UiPath can ride its own AI and automation trends right into a new buy zone.

Online dating leader **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) has its eyes on a new breakout. But will investors swipe right to show interest, or swipe left to take a pass on the Match.com and Tinder parent?




According to the company, [64% of relationships started on an online dating service](https://ir.mtch.com/overview/default.aspx) in the U.S. in the 12 months ended August 2018 were initiated on a Match Group property.


While Match.com remains its namesake platform, Tinder is now the second-highest-grossing app overall in the world. (The statistics are according to AppAnnie for the last 12 months, ending Dec. 31, 2018. It excludes games.)


For the same time period, Tinder was also the world's highest-grossing and most downloaded online dating app.

Tinder Parent Rebooting After EPS Slowdown
------------------------------------------


After posting three quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, Match disappointed Wall Street suitors with a 22% decline in Q4. While revenue also slowed, it still showed a 21% increase, marking a fifth straight report showing sales growth above 20%.


The online dating pioneer sports a solid 24.6% annual pretax profit margin and a stellar 138.8% return on equity. But note that it also carries a heavy debt load, as indicated by a 250% debt-to-equity ratio.


The Dallas-based company didn't make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-cybersecurity-stocks/), but it has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership. In further signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), Match has an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.9 up/down volume ratio.


Analysts have raised their consensus earnings estimates for both 2019 (13%) and 2020 (23%).


Match has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks, which has a record of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


Online Dating Stock Seeks Second Chance To Break Out
----------------------------------------------------


After making its IPO in November 2015 and breaking out of a chart pattern in June 2016, Match stock has made a fourfold run.


Starting last September, Match pulled backed 45% to form a new base as the general stock market went into a correction. During that decline, Match undercut the low in its prior pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). While that's a positive sign that wipes the slate clean for a new run, investors should be wary of bases with declines north of 40%. They often fail to directly generate a sustainable climb. Instead, it may take the formation of another base before the stock really gets going.


Match did temporarily clear its 58.10 entry on Feb. 7, the day after reporting Q4 earnings. But it pulled back the same day to close below it.


Since that awkward first date, Match has managed to find [support at its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and form a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 61.01 buy point. Its relative strength line is within striking distance of a new high.


See if the second time will be the charm for Match as it tries to maintain support at the 50-day moving average and clear the new entry in heavy volume.


On Friday, the stock gained 1.3% in below-average volume to close the week 6% below the buy point.

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) is like the Switzerland of smartphones, happily — and profitably — supplying radio-frequency chips for both **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and Samsung. Like **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), Skyworks got a big boost from the popularity of the iPhone 6. And Samsung will use the firm's chips in the upcoming Galaxy GS6 and S6 Edge phones.

  

As a leading enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, Skyworks' semiconductors are also used in the automotive, medical, networking and other industries.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

In each of the past three quarters, sales growth has come in above 50%, and earnings have risen by at least 75%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 58%, followed by a 16% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Skyworks sports a solid 27% return on equity and a 98 Composite Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After basing for over a year, Skyworks began to soar in January 2014. Like most chip stocks, it sold off in October on speculation that the cyclical semiconductor industry was entering a downturn.

  

But those fears soon faded, and Skyworks continued higher, once again finding good support along its 10-week moving average.

  

It's now working on a flat base with a 102.87 buy point, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

Although Skyworks has occasionally dipped below the 10-week moving average while working on that pattern, it hasn't been living below that benchmark line.

  

See if Skyworks can break out on heavy volume. And keep an eye on the nascent market uptrend: Will it gain traction or revert back to the roller-coaster market we've seen recently?

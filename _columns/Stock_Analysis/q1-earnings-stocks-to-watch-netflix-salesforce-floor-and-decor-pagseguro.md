As recent action in the indexes just showed, the stock market can rebound very quickly from a [market correction back into a market rally](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970).  So it's important to always keep your list of stocks to watch up to date — especially during earnings season.


Start by focusing on stocks like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) that are expected to deliver 50% or higher earnings growth in their next quarterly report. Also keep a close eye on promising [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) like **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and **Azul** ([AZUL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZUL)) which are also showing impressive EPS gains.




To make the list below, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and meet the following benchmarks for its [IBD SmartSelect Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measure the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/):  

• 95 or better Composite Rating.  

• 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating.  

• 80 or greater EPS Rating.  

• B or higher Accumulation Rating.


Stocks To Watch Ahead Of Q1 Earnings
------------------------------------


Netflix rose as much as 63% in just three months from a 204.48 buy point it cleared in early January. However, the streaming giant went into buffering mode as the major indexes pulled back and entered a market correction. But the indexes have rebounded into a nascent uptrend, and Netflix has climbed back above its 50-day line.


Analysts are looking for a 60% spike in EPS growth when Netflix reports Q1 earnings after Monday's close. Netflix was edging higher in early morning trade.


Customer relationship management software leader Salesforce.com has also been testing support at its 50-week moving average after making a quick breakout move. The stock is working on a new flat base showing a 128.97 entry. Consensus analyst estimates call for a 61% gain when Salesforce files its next quarterly earnings report on on May 16.


TD Ameritrade, which earned a spot on IBD's [2018 Best Online Brokers Awards](https://www.investors.com/news/best-online-brokers/best-online-stock-brokers-ibdtipp-annual-investor-survey/), is also working on a new consolidation, a later-stage flat base with a 63.11 buy point. Its relative strength line continues to float around new-high ground.


As [energy stocks shows strength](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/), **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) is expected to pump out a 517% gain in earnings in its next report, expected around May 1.  Analysts expect fellow energy sector stock Viper **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) to deliver a 55% increase in EPS. Viper Energy is rising again early Monday after posting a nearly 6% gain on Friday.


3 Top IPO Stocks To Watch
-------------------------


Three top IPO stocks are on the list: 2018 new issue PagSeguro, and 2017 IPOs Floor & Decor and Azul.


Azul, a Brazilian airline that has posted two quarters of explosive, triple-digit EPS growth, earns the top spot on the list below with analysts expecting a 560% rise in earnings. Azul has pulled back recently, but remains above its 10-week line and 10% above its most recent buy point.


Floor & Decor, which holds the No. 1 ranking among building products retailers, is expecting a 64% gain when it reports in late May. Floor & Decor was able to buck the recent market downturn, closing Friday's session 12% above the 48.77 buy point it cleared ahead of the one-year anniversary of its April 27, 2017 IPO. In early trading Monday, Floor & Decor was up over 1%.


As a leading payment processor, PagSeguro could be referred to as the **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) of Brazil, mainly servicing small and mid-sized businesses. Soon after going public on Jan. 24, PagSeguro formed a base and broke out to a 33% gain in just six weeks. The stock has been pulling back recently, so see if it goes on to form a new base and launch another run after reporting later this month.

IBD 50 Stocks To Watch
----------------------


Strong earnings growth is one of the key traits needed for a company to make the [IBD 50 list of the best growth stocks to watch](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).

**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), **Interactive Brokers** ([IBRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBRK)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) are also on the IBD 50 and expect 50% or higher earnings growth when they next report.

Don't Miss An Earnings Beat
---------------------------


To build and update your  earnings season watch list, regularly check the [earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) to see which stocks are getting ready to report, and keep an eye on daily highlights of [stocks near a buy zone ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/tag/Stocks-Near-Buy-Zone-Ahead-Of-Earnings/).


During earnings season, it's critical to continually update your list of stocks to watch. If the market remains in an uptrend and a stock pops on a big earnings beat, you want to be there, ready to pounce. But keep in mind that disappointing earnings numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.


So use screens like the one here as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as Q1 earnings season kicks into high gear.


Also be sure to [run all your stocks through a buying checklist](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IBD_BuyingChecklist.pdf) before you invest, use sound [sell rules](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) and [check overall market conditions](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/).

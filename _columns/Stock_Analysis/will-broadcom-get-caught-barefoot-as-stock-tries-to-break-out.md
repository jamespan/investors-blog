Chip designers have been among the top performers in the market in recent weeks, with 10 of the 41 stocks in the No. 18-ranked industry group sporting a 90 or higher Composite Rating.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) earns the No. 1 spot among its peers, ahead of **Ceva** ([CEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEVA)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)), **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).Â Inphi and Nvidia join Avago on the [IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Chipping Away At New Buy Point
------------------------------


In terms of stock performance, Nvidia has been on a tear, up nearly 70% since its March breakout. MaxLinear recently cleared a 21.08 entry, while Inphi, Ceva and Monolithic Power Systems have also launched new moves.


Broadcom has been struggling to follow suit, testing a 163.87 [cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=3) buy point on Wednesday and Thursday, but failing to close above it.


The **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) chip supplier's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.7 up/down volume ratio point to institutional demand, so see if the stock can decisively break out in heavy trading.


Will Broadcom Get Caught 'Barefoot'?
------------------------------------


Even with the $32 billion buyout of **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) by **Softbank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)), the $37 billion merger of Avago and Broadcom in 2015 remains the largest in the semiconductor industry.


Broadcom, the Singapore-based chip designer, has strong three-year growth rates for both earnings (67%) and sales (62%).


But top- and bottom-line growth slowed significantly for three straight quarters until rebounding in fiscal 2016 Q2, ended May 1. Earnings growth jumped from 15% to 26% over the two periods, while sales spiked from 8% to 119%. Q3 earnings are expected in late August.


One startup that could make waves for Broadcom is [Barefoot Networks](https://barefootnetworks.com/) and its recently revealed Tofino chip, developed as a faster alternative to Broadcom's Trident and Tomahawk chips, which dominate what the industry calls white box ethernet switching. Barefoot expects to sample Tofino in Q4.

Leading Internet stock **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) cleared a new buy point Tuesday, but with the nascent market uptrend already stumbling, the breakout attempt may end up labeled "return to sender."


Last month, the El Segundo, Calif.-based provider of Internet-based postage services completed its $215 million buyout of Endicia, which provides high-volume shipping technologies and services for U.S. Postal Service shipping.


**Key Numbers**


Stamps.com's 99 Composite Rating earns it the top spot within the No. 2-ranked Internet retailing industry group, ahead of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Chinese e-commerce site **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) and home furnishings retailer **Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)).


Helped by a 28.1% annual pretax profit margin and 21.6% return on equity, the company beat estimates for Q3 with 61% earnings growth and a 37% rise in revenue. Stamps.com also raised its full-year earnings guidance.


Analysts expect 2015 EPS to rise 54%, followed by a 14% gain in 2016, with estimates for both years recently revised higher.


**Chart Analysis**


The stock bolted higher Nov. 6 after the company reported Q3 earnings, soaring almost 39% for the week on volume that came in 143% above average.


Stamps.com then pulled back slightly to form a new flat base, showing tight trading in the bottom of the base â€” a sign of institutional support.


The stock cleared its 106.53 buy point on Tuesday, with volume rising 125% as its Relative Strength line hit new high ground.


But as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off Thursday, Stamps.com also pulled back, slipping just below the buy point. See if the stock can hold its ground and move back into the 106.53-111.86 buy zone in strong volume.

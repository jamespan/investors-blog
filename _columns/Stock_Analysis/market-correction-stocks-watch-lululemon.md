While you want to avoid making new buys in a market correction, leading retail stock **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is a good example of stocks to watch as you wait for a market recovery.


One of the most common and costly mistakes investors make is to walk away and stop following their [investing routine](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/) during a market correction. A market recovery can happen very quickly and the best stocks tend to shoot higher right when a new uptrend begins. So it's critical that you keep building your list of [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) even while the market is down.


Retail Stocks To Watch
----------------------


Lululemon and other retail stocks like **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) , **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and [IBD 50 members](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) have so far fared relatively well as the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average have sold off recently.


While that doesn't mean that now is a good time to buy these stocks, Lululemon and these other retailers provide good examples of three traits to look for when building your watch list during a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970).

1. Market-Leading Relative Strength
-----------------------------------


Look for stocks whose relative strength line is rising or is near or at new highs. Since the relative strength line shows how your stock's price performance compares to that of the S&P 500, a rising RS line means your stock is outperforming the general market.


The sharp rise in Lululemon's relative strength line means the stock is showing resilience in the face of a market sell-off. The RS lines for Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Five Below, Floor & Decor and Burlington Stores have also been indicating market-leading strength.



While it's difficult for any stock to make a sustained upward climb during a market correction, it's a bullish sign that Lululemon's RS line is at a 52-week high as the stock breaks through an area of long-term resistance around 80.


After reporting a [big earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-rise-fourth-quarter-revenue-increases/), Lululemon, which is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/), soared over 9% Wednesday in volume 520% higher than normal. On Thursday, Lululemon rose nearly 4%, again in heavy trade.


2. Strong Institutional Demand And Support
------------------------------------------


The ranking for the apparel and accessories retail industry group has risen from No. 165 (out of 197) to No. 10 over the last six months — a clear sign of rising interest among mutual funds and other institutional investors. With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Lululemon now shares the No. 1 ranking within the group with Burlington Stores.


Another way to gauge institutional support is to see how a stock behaves around the 10-week moving average or a recent buy point. Keep an eye on stocks that find support at such key areas since it's an indicator that large investors are stepping in to support the stock.


In the lead-up to its earnings report and breakout, Lululemon was finding solid support right along the benchmark 10-week line.


For Five Below and 2017 IPO Floor & Decor, note how both these retail stocks have continued to hold their ground above recent buy points. Both stocks closed out the shortened trading week with gains of nearly 4%.


3. Solid Earnings And Sales Growth
----------------------------------


When running your stock ideas through a [stock-buying checklist](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IBD_BuyingChecklist.pdf), it's always important to look for companies with strong earnings and sales growth.


Lululemon has shown two quarters of rising earnings growth and three straight quarters of increasing revenue gains. Floor & Decor also showed sharp acceleration in both EPS and sales last quarter.


Prepare To Profit In Next Market Recovery
-----------------------------------------


Profits come to those who prepare, especially during a market correction. The biggest winners in a new market rally tend to be those that shoot out of the gate right when a new uptrend begins.


To catch those top stocks, it's vital that you continue to build and update your list of stocks to watch even when — indeed, especially when — the market is down.


Market corrections allow leading stocks to form new bases and set up new breakout moves. If you stay engaged and look for stocks that have the three traits above, you'll be in good shape to profit when the next market rally begins.

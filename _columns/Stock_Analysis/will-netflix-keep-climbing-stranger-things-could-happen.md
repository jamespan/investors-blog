Boosted by last year's aggressive global expansion and continued success in developing original hit content like "Stranger Things" and "Orange Is The New Black," **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has entered a new buy zone ahead of its Q4 earnings report on Jan. 18.


It also doesn't hurt that **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and other analysts are [bullish on Internet stocks for 2017](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/goldman-bullish-on-internet-stocks-amazon-google-in-2017/), including the so-called FANG stocks – **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Netflix and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


Goldman has a buy rating on Netflix and Facebook, and has Amazon and Alphabet on its "conviction" list.


Netflix Vs. Amazon Prime Vs. Hulu
---------------------------------


Netflix entered over 130 new countries in 2016 and now has more than 86 million members in 190-plus nations.


Amazon launched its own global expansion last year, with Amazon Prime Video now available in more than 200 countries.


Hulu, which is jointly owned by media titans **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **21st Century Fox** ([FOXA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXA)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **Time Warner** ([TWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWX)), has nearly 12 million members and just [inked a deal with CBS for a new live-TV service](https://www.investors.com/news/cbs-hulu-said-to-be-closing-in-on-live-streaming-deal/).


Testing New Breakout
--------------------


After several quarters of negative earnings growth, Netflix posted a 50% gain in Q2 and 71% rise in Q3. Sales growth has ranged from 23% to 32% over the past eight quarters.


Netflix sports a solid A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating heavy buying by institutional investors over the past three months.



After reporting Q3 earnings on Oct. 17, Netflix soared over 25% for the week in volume 158% above average.


It soon pulled back to add a handle to its chart pattern, creating a 129.39 buy point.


Netflix kicked off the first week of the New Year by clearing that entry in rising volume. On Friday, the stock did reverse somewhat in heavier trading in the final hour, but still closed within the buy zone.


See if Netflix can continue to climb in strong volume and keep its mojo rising with the upcoming Q4 earnings report.

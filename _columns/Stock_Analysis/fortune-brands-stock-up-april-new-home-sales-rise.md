While the rise in [new-home sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/new-home-sales-in-u-s-surge-to-highest-level-in-eight-years/) in April to the highest level in eight years has homebuilders stocks like **DR Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) showing signs of a rebound, **Fortune Brands Home & Security** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) is another name that stands to benefit from a stronger housing market.

Based in Deerfield, Ill., Fortune Brands has a portfolio of companies offering cabinetry, plumbing, door and security products. Roughly half of revenue comes from the repair and remodel market, with another 20% - 25% tied to new-home construction.


The company’s Moen brand of kitchen and bathroom faucets and accessories has exclusive contracts with the majority of America’s largest homebuilders. Moen products are also carried by big box retailers **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)).


On April 20, Fortune Brands reported Q1 numbers that beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Revenue grew 16% to $1.11 billion, while EPS accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, coming in at 39%. The company also raised its full year earnings outlook. 


The stock sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio, indicating institutional demand.


Fortune Brands’ 99 Composite Rating earns it a spot among the top five stocks in the Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group, along with [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)).


**Building Stepping Stones For New Run?**
-----------------------------------------


After resetting its base count in February, the stock broke out off a first-stage base in March. The stock rose just under 14% before pulling back to form a new consolidation.

Note how the stock found support above the earlier buy point and around another area of resistance. That’s a healthy sign of support and an indication the stock may be forming stepping stones for a higher climb.


Another potentially bullish sign is how the Relative Strength line is approaching new high ground ahead as the Fortune Brands tries to close in on a 60.08 entry.

Today we'll check in on **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)).

  

It currently has only one FDA-approved drug, Soliris, which is used to treat two types of rare blood disorders. And it doesn't come cheap. The price tag is around $400,000 a year.

  

Alexion is also working on five new applications for Soliris.

  

Last year, the Food and Drug Administration granted "breakthrough therapy" status for Alexion's latest drug candidate, known as Alxn1101. It's in early-stage testing for the treatment of a rare genetic disease.

  

The FDA's new "breakthrough therapy" designation was created to help speed up the approval process.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Although Alexion has been reliant on one product, it's been a profitable one.

  

Earnings growth has been consistently strong in recent quarters, including a big jump from 45% to 135% in the first quarter.

  

Sales growth has also been strong, and accelerated from 38% to 67% in the latest report.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 58%, followed by a 15% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Alexion has a reputation for being a well-run company, and that's reflected in its strong 29% return on equity, which measure how efficiently an enterprise uses its capital.

  

That attracts interest from institutional investors and despite a small dip last year, the number of funds that own Alexion has been rising.

  

Also, five typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: T Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), MFS Growth A (MFEGX), Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX), Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Dreyfus Mid-Cap Growth F (FRSPX).

  

The fund ownership numbers give you a longer term view of institutional demand, while the Accumulation/Distribution Rating gauges more recent activity by tracking institutional buying and selling over the last 13 weeks.

  

Alexion's rating of E indicates heavy selling during that time.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith weekly chart on this page, Alexion broke out of a first-stage base-on-base pattern in December. It moved higher in tight trading for a few weeks, then shot up 18% when it beat estimates for the fourth quarter.

  

The stock ran into trouble in February, when the biotech industry as a whole began to sell off.

  

Then members of Congress called into question the high price — $84,000 a year — that Gilead Sciences was charging for its drug, Sovaldi.

  

That spooked biotech investors, and since Alexion was charging around $400,000 for Soliris, there were fears it would also be targeted.

  

Those worries sent the stock tumbling below its 10-week line on heavy volume. So that's what caused Alexion's Accumulation/Distribution Rating to fall to an E.

  

The stock managed to stay above its 40-week moving average line, but has so far failed to get back above its 10-week line.

  

So watch if it can get back above that benchmark on strong volume and continue building the right side of its base.

  

This current formation would be a second-stage pattern. However, it's not yet clear if it will become a cup, cup-with-handle or other type of base. But as we wait for a new general market uptrend to begin, watch how it plays out.

  

Look for heavy-volume up days and other signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, and see if Alexion's Accumulation/Distribution Rating can improve to at least a C or better.

  

Also watch the relative strength line to see if it gets into or near new high ground at the time of any breakout.

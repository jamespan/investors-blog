Along with **S&P Global** ([SPGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPGI)) and **Morningstar** ([MORN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MORN)), **Moody's** ([MCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCO)) is known for its credit and company ratings. With MCO stock approaching a new buy point and all-time high, Wall Street wizards are now getting ready to judge Moody's potential new breakout.




S&P Global made the [IBD Breakout Stock Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/sp-500-firm-spgi-near-all-time-high-with-big-profit-margin/) in early August as SPGI stock broke out to reach an all-time high later in the month.


MCO stock is trying to follow suit and clear a 296.76 buy point in a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). A breakout would mark a fresh all-time high for Moody's.


Both SPGI and MCO stock made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-tech-stocks-amazon-apple-microsoft-nvidia/). Moody's is also lifted by accelerating earnings and sales growth. Sales went from a 13% increase to an 18% bounce in Q2, while EPS growth has accelerated for two straight quarters, with a 36% gain in the latest report.


Credit Scores, ESG Ratings Help Judge MCO Stock
-----------------------------------------------


For more than a century, Moody's has been helping organizations make better decisions by assessing risk. In addition to providing credit scores, Moody's also evaluates [ESG](https://esg.moodys.io/) (environment, social and governance) issues and assesses cybersecurity risks for clients.


Moody's affiliate Vigeo Eiris has been a pioneer in ESG analysis since the 1990s. As part of its ESG programs, Moody's provides over 1 million climate risk scores and offers more than 5,000 ESG assessments, covering 273 ESG data points.


Global in scope, Moody's has over 11,300 employees in more than 40 countries.


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), MCO stock is outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). MCO stock holds the No. 1 rating among market research stocks, topping rival SPGI stock, which has a Composite Rating of 96.


Rate This Breakout Attempt: MCO Stock Nears Buy Zone
----------------------------------------------------


MCO stock closed at the top of its price range Friday, just 1% shy of a new breakout. But its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is somewhat lagging. Look for that to move toward a new 52-week high to confirm stock market leadership.


SPGI stock closed the week in new-high ground.


With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 testing new highs and the Dow Jones trying to follow suit, the stock market has become rather frothy. Stocks may continue to run, but a pullback at this point would not be unusual.


So as MCO stock tries to break out, make sure you have [defensive sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) in place to protect yourself from any pullback.

Investments in payment processing stocks like **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Wex** ([WEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEX)) and **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)) have been paying off for investors. Now **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) spinoff **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is trying to cash in on its own recent breakout.


PayPal had its IPO in 2015 as it was spun off from eBay. Not quite three years later, PayPal has an impressive $100 billion-plus market cap and has earned a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


Earlier this month, PayPal made its biggest acquisition since leaving eBay, with the [$2.2 billion buyout of iZettle](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-acquireizettle-square-shopify/).


Based in Sweden, iZettle is a global mobile payment processor. [PayPal's purchase of iZettle](https://investor.paypal-corp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1067868) expands PayPal's in-store capabilities across a wide range of countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Mexico.


Since iZettle competes with Square, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and Brazil's **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), the acquisition also helps strengthen PayPal's position against those payment processing peers.

Payment Processing Stocks To Watch
----------------------------------


PayPal, which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-in-buy-zone-ibd-stock-of-the-day/), cleared an 84.09 buy point Monday. Note that volume was 12% below average, far below the 40% or higher spike you look for on the day of a breakout.


The stock fell back below the entry Thursday, but managed to close the week back in buy zone at 84.34. The buy zone extends to 88.30.



Fellow payment processing stocks Mastercard, Square, Wex, and Green Dot also pulled back Thursday, but each stock closed higher Friday, and they all remain out of buy range from their most recent breakouts.


Boosted by that strong chart action, Mastercard, Wex and Green Dot join PayPal in the list of the top five payment processing stocks in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Square ranks No. 8 within the group, which ranks No. 46 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

Legendary investor Jesse Livermore (1877-1940) wouldn't have known about **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)), which was founded in 1959. But Livermore's [shakeout + 3 early buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/jesse-livermore-was-a-big-fan-of-this-chart-pattern/) could be applied to ATKR stock today.




Atkore has a global network of manufacturing and distribution facilities, providing electrical, safety and infrastructure solutions for the nonresidential construction and industrial markets.


On Jan. 31, the Illinois-based company delivered 144% earnings growth for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Dec. 24). That brings Atkore's average EPS growth over the last three quarters to 302%.


Sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, but still came in at a strong 65% in its latest report. With a 28% annual pretax profit margin and 99% annual return on equity for its most recent full fiscal year, Atkore sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/).

Atkore Sparks Early Entry As Double Bottom Forms
------------------------------------------------


The shakeout + 3 pattern that [Livermore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Livermore) discovered offers an early entry within a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Double bottoms often form during volatile markets. That fits the recent shift from a [stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) earlier in January to a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Jan. 31 to mark a new uptrend, then to some turbulence in early February.


During this volatile period, Atkore has been forming a double bottom. It reached a low at 97.61 to form the first leg down, then undercut that low to hit a new one at 91.96 to form the second leg down.


That makes the conventional buy point 116.05, or 10 cents above the peak of the lopsided W that is characteristic of a double bottom. (If you're not familiar with chart patterns and double bottoms, see this three-part series on [how to read charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).)


Also note that the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for Atkore is near a 52-week high, a sign of market leadership.


With the shakeout + 3, Jesse Livermore presented an earlier entry. The shakeout + 3 pattern comes when — just like a double bottom — a stock starts to rally after the second leg has formed. The buy point is determined by adding three points to the low of the first pullback.


In the case of Atkore, the low of the first pullback was 97.61. So the [shakeout + 3 buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-why-the-shakeout-3-pattern-makes-money/) point would be around 101. (Note that adding three points generally applies only to stocks that are trading in the 20-40 range. A stock priced at $100 a share or higher might need around a 9, 12 or even 15-point gain to reflect the same strength of demand.)


On Wednesday, Atkore gapped up in big volume on earnings. That pushed the stock past the shakeout + 3 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It has since pulled back, leaving it trading right around 100. The stock is around 5% below its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Atkore's conventional 116.05 buy point remains intact.


While looking at individual stocks, always keep the action in the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) in mind. With the recent follow-through day, the market is in a nascent uptrend. After a sell-off on Thursday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed resilience with a nice rebound to end the week.


See if the indexes and Atkore can shake off that pressure and continue their budding moves.

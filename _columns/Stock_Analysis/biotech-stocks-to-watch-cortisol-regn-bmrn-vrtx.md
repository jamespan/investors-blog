While **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), and **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) may be better known [biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)) has been generating some impressive numbers.




Along with **BioMarin Pharmaceuticals** ([BMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMRN)), Corcept, Regeneron and Vertex each sport the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning they're outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of key [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Corcept made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-find-stocks-to-watch-amzn-aapl-msft-nvda-nflx/). Regeneron, Vertex and BioMarin also made the list, as did Alexion.


Although much smaller in terms of market capitalization than fellow biotech stocks Vertex ($70 billion market cap), Regeneron ($68 billion), Alexion ($25.9 billion) and BioMarin ($19 billion), Corcept ($1.7 billion) is among the stock market's [fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/research/fastest-growing-companies-2020-despite-coronavirus/).


Over the past three years, Corcept has generated average annual EPS growth of 69%. The California-based company has posted average annual revenue gains of 50% during the same period.


Corcept has a strong 47.6% annual profit margin and 41.2% return on equity, earning passing grades for both metrics in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-corcept-therapeutics-inc-cort.aspx).


Corcept develops drugs to treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders. It does this by modulating the effects of the stress hormone cortisol. As part of its drug pipeline, the company is involved in a Phase 3 trial (entitled "Gradient") of relacorilant in patients with Cushing's syndrome caused by adrenal adenomas or hyperplasia.


Corcept Among Top Biotech Stocks Near A Buy Point
-------------------------------------------------


Corcept stock is regrouping after struggling to recover from a sell-off that began in February 2018. The stock is now forming a handle showing a 16.82 entry. But it's facing renewed selling pressure after the sharp market sell-off June 11 on fears of a coronavirus second wave.


Reflecting the overall market, downside volume in the handle at the end of the week was heavier than you would like to see. But the stock did manage to come slightly off its lows on Friday. Corcept's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has fallen further below its 52-week high.


Corcept is trying to show resilience by finding support at [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). That benchmark line recently climbed above the longer-term 40-week moving average, a positive sign.


Look for downside volume to lighten up to indicate that large investors are not aggressively selling shares, and see if Corcept can find support and rebound in strong trade.

The biggest players in the global life sciences industry have been moving to the cloud, and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), which went public in 2013, has been helping them get there with cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM), marketing and project-management solutions.


Its roster of over 400 clients -- including **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Bayer** ([BAYRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAYRY)), **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)), **Mylan** ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)) and **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)) -- reads like a Who’s Who of the biotech, consumer health and pharmaceutical industries.


Such demand for Veeva's products has helped generate a 26.5% annual pretax profit margin and three-year annual EPS and sales growth rates of 46% and 47%, respectively. It also helped earn Veeva the No. 4 spot on Forbes' latest [Fast Tech 25](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/forbes-ranks-veeva-fourth-fastest-110300970.html) list of the fastest-growing public tech companies, just behind **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


Enters Buy Zone Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------------


Just ahead of its Thursday earnings report for fiscal 2017 Q1, ended April 30, Veeva has climbed into a 28.05-29.45 buy zone, with its relative strength line climbing toward new high ground.


Keep in mind that it’s risky to buy any stock just before it reports. Also note how Veeva has hit resistance just above the 29 mark multiple times over the last year, so that could happen again this time.


Volume is another factor to watch. Veeva cleared the 28.05 entry on Tuesday, but pulled back to close above it in trading 37% higher than normal. On Wednesday, the stock moved back into the buy zone, but volume was 26% below average. Then on Friday, the stock again moved higher, this time on volume that was trending well above average. 


Look for Veeva Systems to report well and convert its prior ceiling of resistance around 29 into a new floor of support.

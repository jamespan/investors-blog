For stocks to make a sustained climb, they need large infusions of capital from mutual funds and other institutional investors. And there have been signs recently that fund managers may continue to pump more money into **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)).


The leading maker of heart valves and other products to treat cardiovascular disorders made IBD’s most recent list of [new buys by top-performing stock funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-heart-edward-lifesciences-bump-lilly/). From November to January, five leading funds invested approximately $2.4 million in Edwards, and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) added to its position in the stock.


Edwards Lifesciences and rival **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) are the two dominant players in the [fast-growing heart valve market](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/edwards-battles-for-top-spot-in-heart-valve-market/). Edwards officials estimate global sales of aortic valve products will exceed $5 billion by 2021.


Q4 Earnings Report Reveals Strong Pulse
---------------------------------------


Although earnings growth slowed in Q4 from 35% to 19%, Edwards trounced analyst estimates. The company’s 9% sales growth also beat views.


Analysts expect earnings to rise 15% in 2016 and 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


The company sports a solid 22% return on equity, 20% annual EPS growth rate and a 95 Composite Rating, earning it the No. 2 ranking within its Medical–Products industry group.


Is Edwards Pumping Up For New Breakout?
---------------------------------------


Edwards Lifesciences reset its base count in May, and its current consolidation is part of a first-stage base-on-base formation.


The action within the base reflects the volatility seen in the general market in recent months. While that certainly can cause palpitations among investors, the stock has shown some positive technical traits.

It found support at its 40-week moving average, and each time it slipped below the 10-week line, it quickly recaptured that benchmark. Also, the Relative Strength line has continued to edge higher and hover near new high ground.


Edwards tried to clear an 83.53 entry two weeks ago after reporting earnings, but closed the week below the buy point.


See if the general market can rebound from its current correction and if Edwards Lifesciences can make another breakout attempt on volume at least 40% above average.

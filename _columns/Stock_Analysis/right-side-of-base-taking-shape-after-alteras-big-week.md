After a burst last week, **Altera**'s ([ALTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALTR)) base is looking better these days.

  

The stock broke out of a somewhat lopsided cup with handle in April 1.

  

It moved up modestly but stalled out as the overall market fell into a correction around the same time.

  

Altera tried to buck the overall downtrend, but when the general market goes down, it eventually takes most stocks down with it. In the end, Altera was no exception.

  

The stock started forming a new base. Shares fell below the 10-week moving average and spent several weeks below it 2.

  

On Thursday it recaptured the 10-week line, but volume has been weak despite the surge in price 3.

  

So far, there is more distribution than accumulation in the base, judging by the down weeks in heavy volume 4.

  

Still, Altera has more base building to do before it reaches a possible buy point. So it has some time left to draw some up weeks in above-average volume.

  

The pattern so far has exhibited some tight price action, which bodes well. The Relative Strength line is near a new high, which is another plus 5.

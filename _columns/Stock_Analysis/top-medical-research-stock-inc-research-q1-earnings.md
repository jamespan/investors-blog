Clinical trials and the FDA approval process can make or break biotech, pharmaceutical and medical device maker stocks. Just ask **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), which rose nearly 17% on April 4 on positive trial results for its Sapien family of heart valves.


With so much riding on the success of the trials, it's no surprise that the clinical research organizations (CROs) that design and conduct that research can be quite profitable.


**INC Research** ([INCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCR)) is a case in point. The Raleigh, NC-based CRO has a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 228%, and over the last three quarters, it’s posted average earnings growth of 120%.


No. 1 Stock Within Industry Group
---------------------------------


INC holds the No. 1 ranking within the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group, ahead of **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), C**harles River Labs International** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)), **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) and **Luminex** ([LMNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMNX)).


On the downside, the group itself ranks a lowly No. 102, putting it in the bottom half of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


INC’s sales growth has not been as robust as its earnings, but revenue accelerated from a 17% gain to 23% last quarter. First-quarter numbers are expected around April 25. 


Clear signs of institutional demand for the stock include a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio and five straight quarters of rising fund ownership.  


One yellow flag is the company’s 217% debt-to-equity ratio, which could hurt cash flow and profits if interest rates rise and the cost of servicing that debt increases significantly.


Nears Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------------


After being taken private by Avista Capital Partners in 2010, INC returned to the public market in November 2014. It made nearly a three-fold gain before peaking in August, as **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) and other drugmaker stocks sank on a tweet from Hillary Clinton accusing them of price gouging.

Although the 10-week line remains below the 40-week moving average, the stock has flashed signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, including multiple up weeks in heavy volume. 


INC kicked off this week with three strong gains, ranging from around 2% to 4%. Each of those days came on big spikes in volume, showing large investors were scooping up shares ahead of a possible breakout.


Another bullish sign is how the Relative Strength line is trending higher and approaching new high ground, as the stock tries to close in on the 50.50 entry.

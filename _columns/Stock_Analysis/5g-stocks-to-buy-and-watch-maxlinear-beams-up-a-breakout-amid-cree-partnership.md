Earning a spot among the best 5G stocks to watch, **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) and **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) have teamed up to efficiently power new ultrawideband 5G.




On June 23, [MaxLinear and Cree announced breakthrough performance](https://investors.maxlinear.com/press-releases/detail/436/maxlinear-linearization-and-cree-gan-on-sic-power) with their 5G technology. By combining technologies, the companies accelerate the rollout of 5G by enabling significant power, thermal and cost savings through more efficient wireless transmission.


Based in Carlsbad, Calif., MaxLinear provides radio frequency (RF) and mixed-signal integrated circuits for wired and wireless infrastructure.


The new solution from MaxLinear and Cree tackles a substantial industry challenge: implementing radio units with 5G massive MIMO arrays, while keeping a reasonable size, weight and power. The newer 5G spectrum is at a higher carrier frequency and has wider bandwidths. That makes it more challenging to achieve high power efficiency for radio units.

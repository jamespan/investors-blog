Top Funds Buying Heico Stock
----------------------------


Based in Hollywood, Fla., Heico has averaged double-digit annual growth for both sales (13%) and earnings (17%) over the last three years. The company also sports a solid 20% annual pretax profit margin and a 17% return on equity.


Heico is scheduled to report results for fiscal Q1 of 2019 (ended Jan. 31) on Feb. 26. Analysts expect a 27% increase in earnings.


In a sign of strong institutional demand, Heico stock made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-splunk-stock-netflix-stock/), with six leading mutual funds picking up an estimated $70 million in shares between November and January. The stock also sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.4 up/down volume ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership.


Defense Stocks Near A Buy Point
-------------------------------


From a breakout in April 2016, Heico stock rose 205% before pulling back to build its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The new consolidation is a second-stage cup, showing a 78.55 buy point.


In a potential sign of a technical rebound, the 50-day moving average is trying to retake the longer-term 200-day line. Plus, Heico's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is just below a new 52-week high.


Keep in mind that it can be risky to buy a stock just before it reports, but see if Heico can report solid numbers on Feb. 26 and clear the entry in strong volume.


In early trading Wednesday, the stock is trading approximately 2% below the buy point.



Fellow defense stocks Boeing and TransDigm are also showing strength. Boeing is out of buy range from an earlier breakout, while TransDigm has soared above its recent 375.50 entry.

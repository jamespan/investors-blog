Leading medical device maker **Cantel Medical** ([CMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMN)) is testing a key line of support as it continues to work on an early-stage base.


The New Jersey-based company is currently the No. 2 stock within the medical systems and equipment industry group, behind **Cynosure** ([CYNO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYNO)) and ahead of **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) and **Hill-Rom** ([HRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRC)).


Cantel develops devices and systems to prevent and control infections that can occur in hospitals and other medical settings. It focuses on three core areas: endoscopy, water purification and filtration, and health care disposables.


The more than 2 million health care-associated infections that occur in the U.S. each year, costing the health care system $33 billion annually, drive the demand for Cantel’s products.


Top Fund Managers Buy Shares
----------------------------


Sales growth has been steady, ranging from 12% to 18% over the last eight quarters. For fiscal Q2, which ended Jan. 31, earnings growth slowed from 21% the previous quarter to 17%.


The stock’s 1.5 up/down volume ratio points to institutional demand, and Cantel Medical made IBD’s latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-on-defense-with-reits-airlines-and-building-stocks/).


Brown Capital Management Small Company Investor Shares Fund ([BCSIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCSIX)), which was [the best-performing small-cap growth fund](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/small-cap-stocks-that-help-make-this-brown-capital-fund-top-notch/) with $100 million or more in assets over the last decade, has a substantial stake in Cantel Medical.


Finding Support Or Resistance?
------------------------------


Cantel Medical stock has been testing its 10-week line as it tries to close in on a 72.79 entry in a flat base.


As the stock was forming the right side of the prior cup-shaped pattern, there were several days of above-average volume. Even down days in heavy trading on March 17 and 30 were actually positive signs of support, as the stock rebounded to close in the upper half of the price range.


See if that support holds, allowing Cantel to reclaim its 10-week moving average and complete its base.

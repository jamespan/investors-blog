As homebuilders like **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) show strength, the No. 1-ranked mortgage stock, **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)), is trying to close on a new breakout move.









 
 
 The Bermuda-based provider of mortgage insurance and reinsurance is on both the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) screens, which have shown [S&P 500-beating performance in 2017](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).
Essent's 99 Composite Rating earns it top billing within the Finance-Mortgage Services group, which ranks No. 14 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Lending Tree** ([TREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREE)) is also among the top stocks in the industry.


The homebuilders group ranks No. 5, with **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), **Taylor Morris Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) and KB Home holding the top three slots among their industry peers.


Strong EPS And Sales Growth
---------------------------


Boosted by an exceptional 68% pretax profit margin and solid 18% return on equity, Essent has delivered strong annual growth over the last three years for both earnings (51%) and sales (44%).


Earnings-per-share rose 38% in Q1, and analysts are looking for a 24% gain when Essent reports second-quarter numbers around in early August.


Longer term signs of institutional demand have been strong, with four straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


But the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which tracks buying and selling by large investors over the last 13 weeks has slipped to a C. See if that can improve to a B or better, and look for the 0.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio to get back above 1 to show rising demand.


Steppingstones To New Breakout?
-------------------------------


After forming a 61-week cup with handle that it cleared in September, Essent has been building a series of bases that have acted like steppingstones as the stock has climbed gradually higher.


The most recent three formations count as one, first-stage base-on-base since the stock failed to rise at least 20% from each buy point along the way before starting to build a new pattern.



Such behavior often reflects action in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and Essent has shown positive behavior by generally finding support at its prior buy points and its 10-week moving average line.


Essent is also showing two other signs of technical strength. Its relative strength line is closing in on new high ground ahead of a possible breakout, and its 10-day moving average just moved back above the longer-term 50-day line.


On Wednesday, Essent closed at 38.18, 3% below the current potential buy point of 39.60. On Thursday, the stock bounced back from a dip earlier in the day to close in positive territory and up just under 3% for the week. Look for Essent to clear the entry price in volume at least 40% above average.

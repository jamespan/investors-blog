Although **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) has already broken out, the stock remains near its buy point.

  

The fertilizer company formed a cup-with-handle base from February until its breakout on May 23 **1**. The move coincided with a jump in commodity prices.

  

The buy point was 145.35, or 10 cents above the peak in the handle. Volume on the breakout was 95% above average — a convincing level of trading.

  

The Relative Strength line made a new high, confirming the breakout **2**.

  

Still, it wasn't an ideal pattern, because the price action was a bit volatile in the handle.

  

The stock made modest gains but has fallen back near the buy point. Such retracements are normal for many stocks, and the way CF shares are acting is encouraging.

  

Volume the past couple of weeks, as the stock eased, has been light **3**. Also, the stock basically has held above the 145.35 buy point.

  

The current base is a third-stage pattern. A first-stage base was a deep cup with handle, with a breakout in October. It advanced and then broke out of a flat base — a second-stage pattern — on Dec. 23.

Boosted by Donald Trump's campaign promises of increased infrastructure spending, building-sector stocks like **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)), **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)), **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) and **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) rallied right after the election.


But building materials suppliers like Marietta Martin and Vulcan — as well as steel producers like U.S. Steel, **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) and **AK Steel** ([AKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKS)) — have pulled back or paused in their climbs as investors wait to see what the New Year and a new administration will bring.


The postelection market rally may also be showing signs of fatigue, meaning investors now face two questions: [Can Trump revive Reagan's stock-market magic](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-trump-revive-reagans-stock-market-magic/) next year? And will Martin Marietta and its sector peers ride that wave to high-rise gains?


Constructive Demand
-------------------


Martin Marietta's 83 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot among its fellow makers of cement and heavy building materials, right behind **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)). **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)), U.S. Concrete and Vulcan Materials round out the top five.


Since posting earnings growth of 886% in Q1, Martin Marietta's profit gains slowed to 56% and 22% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Revenue growth has also slowed from 14% in the first quarter to 2% in Q3.


But Martin Marietta has shown signs of institutional demand, including a 1.6 up/down volume ratio and three straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Laying Foundation For New Breakout?
-----------------------------------


Martin Marietta gapped up to clear a 206.46 entry the day after the presidential election, closing over 11% higher in heavy volume.



Although it's eased back to consolidate those gains, downside volume has been relatively light, and the stock did not come back down to "fill the gap." Such behavior points to institutional support.


Martin Marietta's current consolidation is a flat base as part of a base-on-base formation.


On Tuesday, the stock rang quietly rang in the New Year with a fractional gain in light volume, bringing it slightly closer to a 236.51 entry.

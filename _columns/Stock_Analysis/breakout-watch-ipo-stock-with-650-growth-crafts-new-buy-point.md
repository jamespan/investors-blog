Top  [Chinese stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) and **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) have helped make the internet retail industry IBD's No. 1-ranked group. Now fellow online retailer **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) is testing a new breakout.









 
 
 Etsy, Alibaba, Vipshop, Baozun, **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) and **Petmed Express** ([PETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETS)) are all tied for the No. 2 ranking with a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), meaning they're outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).
Founded in 2005 in Brooklyn, followed by its IPO 10 years later in 2015, Etsy provides an online marketplace for makers and retailers to sell their handcrafted and vintage goods.


650% Earnings Growth … With A Caveat
------------------------------------


In Q3, Etsy posted a 650% spike in earnings, its second straight quarter of triple-digit growth. But note that percentage gains for both those reports are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters where the company showed a loss.


Etsy is on tap to report Q4 earnings on Feb. 27, with analysts expecting an EPS increase of 147%.


The company has grown revenue at a 34% clip over the last three years, including gains ranging from 18% to 40% over the last eight quarters.


Stitching Together New Breakout?
--------------------------------


Etsy has been working on a second-stage consolidation with a 21.96 buy point, which it has been testing in Wednesday morning trading.



Note how the bottom of its current base formed right around the entry in its prior pattern — a sign of support that may mean the stock is forming stepping-stones for a continued climb.


The relative strength line has been trending higher and is near new high ground as Etsy pokes its head into buy range.


Institutional demand for shares is reflected in its 1.4 up/down volume ratio, A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and two straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Leading mutual fund T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)), which has a long track record of success and earns an A+ rating, owns just under 4% of Etsy's shares.


Keep in mind that, as **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) confirmed last week with its [post-earnings sell-off](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/arista-logmein-leading-stocks-dive/), it can be risky to buy a breakout stock just ahead of earnings. It's typically best to wait and see how the company reports and how the market reacts.


On Tuesday, Etsy rose 1.6% in above-average volume, putting it 3% below the entry. In early trading Wednesday, the stock climbed just above the buy point with a gain of 3.5%.


Alibaba is up over 2%, putting it just below the 191.85 entry it cleared earlier. Baozun is up nearly 4% as it works on a second-stage consolidation, and Vipshop is also up more than 3%. Stamps.com, which reports earnings after today's close, is trying to stay above its 50-day moving average.

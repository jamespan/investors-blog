------------------------------------------------------------------------


Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences are both among the top-rated stocks in the medical products industry group, which ranks No. 22 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Edwards Lifesciences shares the No. 2 spot with **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) with a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). **Merit Medical Systems** ([MMSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMSI)), which also made the list of new buys by top funds, holds top billing with the highest-possible score of 99. Boston Scientific has a 96 Composite Rating.

Edwards Lifesciences also posted an annual pretax profit margin of 29.7% and a return on equity of 33%, nearly double the 17% minimum you look for. The stock's fundamental strength has helped it earn a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


By comparison, Boston Scientific has a 21.8% ROE and a 26.9% profit margin. It posted just under $2.6 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter.


Edwards Lifesciences Stock, Boston Scientific Stock Both Testing Buy Zones
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Investors have been lifting the share prices for both Edwards Lifesciences and Boston Scientific since the two firms settled their patent disputes in January.


Edwards is testing a 175.10 buy point in a first-stage base. While forming that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), the stock temporarily lost support at its 50-day moving average, but held its ground at its [second line of defense](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/), the 200-day line.


Edwards Lifesciences is now solidly back above its 50-day line, but the volume driving that climb has been below average. Look for heavier trading to kick in as it tries to pump up a new breakout.


In morning trading Tuesday, the stock has entered the buy zone, but again volume is trending below average.



Boston Scientific stock is also just above a new buy point of 39.54. Volume has been higher than that of Edwards Lifesciences, which explains why Boston Scientific tops Edwards' B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating with a B+. Tuesday's trading volume is trending slightly higher than normal.


See if both stocks can break out in volume at least 40% higher above average.

While **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) top the enterprise software group, **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) remains at the forefront of the digital transformation it helped pioneer back in the dot-com era.




With its IPO in October 1999, Akamai stock has weathered the dot-com crash and the Great Recession in 2008. Now with its content delivery network (CDN) services, Akamai is navigating the [coronavirus stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) and the tsunami of demand for internet services being driven by the pandemic.


The coronavirus shutdowns have only heightened the need for telecommuting solutions, video streaming and cloud-based apps. This strains networks trying to handle that increased use of bandwidth. Demand for companies like Akamai, **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) has spiked as a result.

Dot-Com Pioneer Seeks 'Intelligent Edge' In Coronavirus Stock Market
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Based in Massachusetts, Akamai delivers fast, smart and secure content across a network of 240,000 servers in over 130 countries. Through its "intelligent edge" platform, Akamai works with clients to optimize web performance, media delivery, Internet of Things technology and mobile apps.


Sales growth has been relatively slow but steady, ranging from 6% to 9% over the last seven quarters. Earnings growth has ranged from 15% to 51% during the same period.


Institutional investors like Akamai's efficiency, marked by a 30% pretax profit margin and 22% return on equity in 2019. Akamai stock has posted four quarters of rising fund ownership. Sixty-six funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in the stock.


Plus, in IBD's latest report on new buys by the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-lead-apple-netflix-microsoft-google-coronavirus-stock-market-rebound-attempt/), 11 top money managers picked up $12 million worth of shares in Akamai stock.


Akamai Stock Tests Cup-With-Handle Buy Point
--------------------------------------------


As the coronavirus stock market tries to build on its April 2 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), Akamai stock is near a 98.35 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). (View the daily chart to see the handle formation.)


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been trending higher and is just below a new 52-week high. The handle has a wedging shape, which is considered a weakness. If a breakout at that area fails, investors can look for a breakout at Akamai's prior highs.


While we don't know if the nascent stock market uptrend will become a lasting one or not, history shows that the best stocks tend to break out right as a new bull market begins. See if Akamai stock can enter a new buy zone as this market rally hopefully gains traction.


Akamai stock fell 2% Thursday to close out a shortened week. It's now 3% below the buy point.

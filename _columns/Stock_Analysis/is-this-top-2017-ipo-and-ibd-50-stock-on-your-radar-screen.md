While United Kingdom-based **Micro Focus International** ([MFGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFGP)) may be new to U.S. investors, it hasÂ  been one of the [best IPO stocks in 2017](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) and has a long history in the software industry.









 
 
 Founded in 1976, Micro Focus went public on the London Stock Exchange in 1983. It stopped trading after being acquired by Intersolv in 1998, but returned to the public markets in 2005.
Micro Focus agreed to a merger last year with the software business spun off by **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)), creating one of the world's largest pure-play software companies. Micro Focus went public on the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 1.


Software Industry Leader
------------------------


Micro Focus develops software solutions for predictive analytics and Big Data, security and risk management, collaboration, and IT operations management.


On Wednesday, [Micro Focus released StormRunner Functional](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micro-focus-unveils-stormrunner-functional-124500851.html), which the company calls "a new cloud-based, analytics-powered service enabling software development teams to test applications across any browser, operating system or mobile device."


The stock's 98 Composite Rating ties it with **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) and **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) for the No. 2 ranking within the specialty enterprise software group. **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) holds the top spot.


Alarm.com, Atlassian and Micro Focus are all members of the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


Micro Focus earns an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-4/) of A, which means that in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity, it's in the top 20% of all publicly traded companies.


IPO Base Breakout
-----------------


As the [high-profile IPOs](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/) of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) showed, it's risky to buy a stock on the day it goes public. To reduce your risk, it's best to wait for the stock to form and break out from its first consolidation, called an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/).


After making a solid market debut in September, Micro Focus broke out of its first consolidation on Oct. 25.



Keep in mind that, as Alibaba proved when it pulled back following its breakout from an IPO base, stocks can be particularly volatile in the early months following their initial public offerings. Be sure to also keep a close eye on the general market to see if the underlying uptrend holds.


In the meantime, Micro Focus' solid fundamentals, healthy chart action, and strong RS line mean its one 2017 IPO to watch.


The stock was down fractionally Friday, but closed the week nearly 3% higher.

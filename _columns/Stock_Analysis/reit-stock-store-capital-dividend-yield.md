While interest rate hikes are still on the table for 2016, the Federal Reserve took a more dovish stance at its latest meeting, giving a boost to real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks like **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)).


[IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)), as well as **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) and **Education Realty Trust** ([EDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDR)), also moved higher.


As of June 16, the 6.73% year-to-date return for the S&P United States REIT Index had outpaced the S&P 500's 1.67% gain.


Strong Growth, Solid Yield
--------------------------


Store Capital's name is an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate. As of March 31, it had investments in 1,397 property locations, including some used by restaurants, movie theaters and other service, retail and industrial companies.


The Arizona-based company pays a dividend, currently yielding 4%, topping the payouts of CoreSite (2.5%), Public Storage (2.9%) and Extra Space Storage (3.5%).


Store Capital, which went public in November 2014, also sports a strong three-year annual growth rate for both earnings (101%) and sales (77%), as well as a 29% annual pretax profit margin.


Breaking Out Into New Buy Zone
------------------------------


The stock has been working on a flat base as part of a base-on-base formation. A 1.3 up/down volume ratio and rising fund ownership in recent quarters point to institutional demand for Store Capital.


After finding support along its 10-week moving average line in recent weeks, the stock cleared a 27.05 buy point. Volume came in 8% below average, well below the 40% or higher spike you prefer to see on the day of a breakout.


Store Capital continues to test the 27.05-to-28.40 buy zone, but keep in mind the volatile nature of the market and be sure to have a defensive game plan for any new buys.

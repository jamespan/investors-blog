After Friday's earnings reports from **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), a top-rated insurance and financial services stock, **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)), entered a new buy zone.


The Georgia-based provider of term life insurance, mutual funds and annuities bolted past a buy point Friday, as the [big bank stocks delivered varied results](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-bank-of-america-wells-fargo-report-q4-earnings/) but rose sharply at the open. Primerica is scheduled to report Q4 earnings on Feb. 8.


The new moves come after financial stocks rose sharply on Donald Trump's surprise victory, then consolidated those gains following the Federal Reserve's December rate hike.


Highly Rated Stock In Highly Ranked Industry
--------------------------------------------


Primerica's 96 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot in the No. 12-ranked life insurance industry group.


The company insures approximately 5 million lives and has over 2 million client investment accounts, helping it generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenue.


Earnings growth has averaged 22% over the past three quarters and 14% over the past three years.


Sales growth has been in the single digits, ranging from 3% to 8% over the last eight quarters.


Signs of institutional demand include rising fund ownership over the past three quarters and a 1.7 up/down volume ratio.


Later-Stage Base
----------------


Trump's election ignited Primerica to a nearly 30% gain for the week ended Nov. 11.


The stock then consolidated those gains while forming a shallow, third-stage flat base, just 6% in depth.



While such later-stage bases are more prone to failure, Primerica's tight trading and good support at the 10-week line point to healthy technical action.


The stock jumped past the 73.15 buy point Friday morning, and ended the week within the buy zone that extends to 76.81. Volume was below the 40% or greater spike you look for on a breakout. But weekly volume was well above the prior week's total and the Relative Strength line entered new high ground.


See if the financial sector remains a fund favorite, and if Primerica can deliver strong fourth-quarter results when it reports next month.

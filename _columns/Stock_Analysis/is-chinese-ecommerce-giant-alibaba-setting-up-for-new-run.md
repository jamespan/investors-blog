Today we'll check in on Chinese e-commerce giant, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), which had the largest IPO ever back in September.

  

Already China's dominant player in the online and mobile retail space, Alibaba has also been taking a large slice of the worldwide online advertising pie. As IBD pointed out this week, [Alibaba is now No. 4](http://news.investors.com/technology/121614-730777-baidu-alibaba-gain-as-digital-ad-powerhouses.htm), behind **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), in terms of mobile ad revenue. It's expected to capture 6.2% of all mobile ad dollars this year, up from just 1.6% in 2013.

  

In November, founder Jack Ma said the company would have a separate IPO for Alipay, a PayPal-type service which is China's dominant online payment processor. No timeline for the offering was given, but Ma indicated Alipay would be listed in China, rather than the U.S.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of explosive growth, earnings slowed in Q3 to 15% as increased spending ate into Alibaba's profit margins. But EPS gains met analyst expectations, and the company beat on revenue. That marked the second consecutive quarter of accelerated sales growth.

  

For the full fiscal year, analysts expect earnings to rise 20%, followed by a 38% gain in fiscal 2016.

  

The company has a stellar 112% return on equity and a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 116%.

  

Overall, it earns the highest possible 99 Composite Rating, and continues to show signs of institutional demand.

  

It has a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio. And since going public in September, over 1,000 funds have reported a position in the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Right after its IPO, Alibaba headed lower for a few weeks, but rebounded to form its first base.

  

It started to close in the upper half of the weekly price range on rising volume as it built the right side of that pattern, a sign institutional investors were picking up shares. Volume surged even higher on the week of the breakout that followed.

  

The stock quickly rose about 20%, but began to pull back in mid-November.

  

It eventually came down to its 10-week moving average line, where it recently found support. That support was also just above the prior 99.80 buy point.

  

Alibaba may now be forming a new base, and its relative strength line has started to trend higher, a sign of strength in a weak market.

  

Since the general market is currently in a correction, it's best to avoid new buys. But if Alibaba ends up forming a base, it could be poised to launch a new run when the market rebounds and a new uptrend begins.

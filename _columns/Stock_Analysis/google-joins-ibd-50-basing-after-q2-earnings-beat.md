Earlier this week, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) earned itself a [new spot on the IBD 50](http://news.investors.com/technology/090815-769985-google-leads-tech-stocks-ibd-50-this-week.htm) list of top growth stocks. So what's behind the search giant's latest moves?

  

In addition to the ongoing battle for mobile ad revenue, Google competes with tech titans **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) across an expanding range of industries.

  

Its self-driving cars could share the road with electric vehicles from Apple and **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), and the upcoming Nexus smartphone will butt heads with the [soon-to-be-launched iPhone 6S](http://news.investors.com/technology/090915-770330-apple-stock-aapl-falls-after-iphone-6s-launch.htm).

  

Google is also trying to gain market share from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud computing and storage business.

  

And while its YouTube division still leads in online video, it's facing new challenges from Facebook, as well as from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), Amazon Prime and Apple TV video streaming.

  

To streamline this wide array of activity, Google recently changed its parent company name to Alphabet, separating newer entities from its core brands, like YouTube and Android, which will remain under the Google umbrella.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Investors liked what they heard when Google reported Q2 numbers on July 16, blowing past earnings estimates to deliver a 17% gain.

  

A Nomura analyst also noted that the report [debunked certain fears about Google](http://news.investors.com/technology/071715-762178-google-q2-earnings-beat-stock-hits-new-high.htm) by showing that desktop search is still rising and YouTube viewership posted its fastest growth n two years.

  

The Mountain View, Calif.-based firm sports an 18% return on equity and a solid 97 Composite Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As Google was forming a long consolidation ahead of the second-quarter report, it flashed many weeks of tight trading right along the 10-week line.

  

The stock bolted out of that range on July 17, the day after earnings, finishing the week up more than 25%. Volume came in 178% above average.

  

Although the stock gave back a large chunk of those gains over the next several weeks as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off, it's been finding support at the 10-week moving average and is working on an early-stage consolidation.

  

While the nascent uptrend that began on Sept. 8 has already shown signs of trouble, see if Google can find support and move higher if the market rally does gain traction.

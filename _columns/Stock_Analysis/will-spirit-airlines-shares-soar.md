Today we're going to look at **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) to see how it's been holding up as the market grinds through its correction.

  

They help customers save money on air travel by offering ultra low fares with a range of optional services for a fee. Then customers choose only the extras they want.

  

Those a la carte services include a bigger front seat, assigned seats, carry on and checked bags and other features.

  

They also offer hotels, cars, and other vacation packages.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth ranged from 18% to 33% the past ninequarters.

  

Earnings growth was in the triple digits the past two quarters.

  

The company is due to report first-quarter results April 29.

  

For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 21% in 2014 and 25% in 2015.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-spirit-airlines-inc-save.aspx) shows Spirit's Composite, EPS and SMR ratings are the best among the 19 stocks in its Transportation-Airline industry group.

  

And the group itself is ranked No. 6 among IBD's 197 groups. So it's been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In Feb. the budget airline rebounded up from the 50-day moving average line after reporting estimate-beating fourth-quarter earnings.

  

That bounce launched a new climb and the stock went on to notch a series of record highs.

  

As the market fell into a correction it's pulled back once again. And so far it again seems to be finding support at that 50-day line.

  

So watch to see if it can rebound up from that benchmark line on heavy volume. If that happens and a new uptrend is underway, it could provide a buying opportunity.

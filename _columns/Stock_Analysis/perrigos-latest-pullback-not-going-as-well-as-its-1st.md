Drugmaker **Perrigo** ([PRGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGO)) has made a second pullback to the 10-week moving average since its January breakout, but this time it's tougher going.

  

Perrigo broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 20 **1**. The base was part of a base-on-base pattern that began forming a year ago.

  

Shares made good progress until they pulled back to the 10-week line in gentle fashion **2**. The price action was mild and volume was modest â€” both indicating that institutional investors weren't selling Perrigo shares en masse.

  

The stock found support and reached a record high in late April. That was the starting point for the latest pullback.

  

One difference now is that Perrigo has dropped in heavier trading **3**. Most of the down volume came on May 3, when the company reported its quarterly results.

  

Also, the stock has slipped below its 10-week moving average **4**. Watch for it to reclaim the line, ideally in strong trading.

  

The stock's pullback appears likelier to be a new base in the making. Given that the market is in a correction, Perrigo could continue basing for several weeks.

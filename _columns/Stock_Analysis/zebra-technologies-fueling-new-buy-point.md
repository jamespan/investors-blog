As the reopening of the economy expands, pent-up demand across a wide range of industries has outstripped the speed of the recovery in the supply chain. That's where logistics and intelligent automation leader **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)) comes in. Demand for its products and services has ZBRA stock moving back into buy zone and just below a new all-time high.




Zebra Technologies has over 10,000 partners across 100 countries. It helps companies streamline operations in retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, health care and other industries.


The company offers a wide and integrated range of bar code scanners, handheld computers, data-capture software and other solutions to increase productivity. Based in Illinois, Zebra helps clients enhance the shopping experience, track and manage inventory, and improve supply chain efficiency.

Earlier in June, convenience store and gas station operator [Maverick selected Zebra Technologies](https://investors.zebra.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Maverik-Selects-Zebra-and-Reflexis-to-Streamline-Store-Execution-and-Labor-Scheduling/default.aspx) and its Reflexis Systems to streamline store execution and labor scheduling. With more than 350 locations, Maverick is a convenience store brand in 11 states. The company is known for its premium BonFire food.


Now part of Zebra Technologies, Reflexis ONE will be used by Maverick to replace two disparate task and workforce management solutions. Maverick will deploy Reflexis Real-Time Task Manager, Reflexis Workforce Scheduler and Reflexis Time and Attendance to simplify tasks, labor operations and compliance.


Award-Winning Transportation And Logistics Drive Big Growth
-----------------------------------------------------------


In May, Zebra Technologies took home honors in the [CompassIntel IoT Innovator Awards](https://investors.zebra.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Zebra-Technologies-Wins-Compass-Intelligence-Innovation-Leadership-Award-in-Transportation--Logistics/default.aspx).


Compass Intelligence recognized Zebra's [SmartPack Trailer](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/solutions/intelligent-edge-solutions/smartpack.html) solution with an Innovation Leadership Award in Transportation & Logistics. Zebra SmartPack enables companies to reshape their logistics efforts everywhere, from cross docks with trailers to loading stations with air cargo containers. SmartPack helps eliminate blind spots in the supply chain.


[Institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) like what they see from Zebra Technologies, evidenced by 97 [mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-big-on-semiconductor-finance-machinery-transportation-sectors/) with an A+ from IBD holding ZBRA stock. Wall Street watchers also expect big things from the company.


After posting 79% earnings growth last quarter, analysts see Zebra Technologies delivering a 71% increase in Q2. For the full year, they expect 33% EPS growth.


Just as Zebra streamlines logistics and supply chain operations for clients, the company itself is very efficiently run. Zebra Technologies sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole.


Can Supply Chain Efficiency Supply A Breakout For ZBRA Stock?
-------------------------------------------------------------


On June 4, Zebra Technologies broke past a 508.43 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The stock pulled into a rest stop in the days that followed, but managed to refuel and move back into the buy zone, albeit in light volume. It closed Friday just above the entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has fallen off its old highs as Zebra formed two fairly shallow bases, including the most recent one, since February.


With supply chain and logistics top of mind across many sectors and industries, see if Zebra Technologies can deliver a heavy-volume climb to a new high.

Even the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) can lose their luster sometimes. Just ask **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). But as **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) shows, the return of a prodigal stock can be glorious.




While [Tesla](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/) struggles to correct its long slide off a string of downturns since 2021, [Meta stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-why-analyst-upped-targets-for-new-trillion-dollar-stock/) has now skyrocketed as much as 461% from its lows in November 2022 to another record it just hit Friday.


The Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp parent has set up a new launchpad for even more gains. Holding most of its surge from a [gap-up on Q4 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-surges-as-company-beats-earnings-expectations-initiates-dividend/), Meta stock traded sideways to form a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#alternativebuypoints).


The top of that formation around 485.96 sets the buy point. After Meta gapped up past that entry in rising and above-average volume Thursday, the stock eased off its intraday highs Friday to close in buy range at 484.03.


Note that a three-weeks-tight pattern is typically considered a place to add shares to an existing position rather than start a new one. The number of shares purchased for add-on buys should be less than for earlier positions to keep the average share price down.

Meta Vs. Tesla: A Tale Of Two Stocks
------------------------------------


Tesla's recent turmoil does not mean the EV pioneer cannot rebound. It certainly can, and Wall Street forecasts for 2025 call for the company to recharge and deliver a spike to 38% earnings growth in 2025.


But a quick comparison of both the fundamentals and technical action in Meta and Tesla paints a clear picture.


After a severe slump of its own from 2022 to early 2023, Meta has generated three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth. In Q4, the Mark Zuckerberg-led social media giant posted earnings of $5.33 per share, a 203% jump over the prior-year quarter.


Tesla, on the other hand, has seen profits decelerate in three of the last four quarters. Earnings for the fourth quarter slowed 40% to 71 cents a share.


Revenue for Tesla has declined over the last two quarters, sliding to just 3% year-over-year growth in Q4. Meanwhile, Meta continues to build on its growth trajectory. From 3% sales growth to $28.6 billion in Q1, Meta Platforms drove a 25% year-over-year gain to $40.1 billion in Q4.


The powerful action in the chart for Meta stock reflects that turnaround in the company's fundamentals. The reverse is true for the troubles in Tesla stock.


Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google Spur Demand From Top Funds
----------------------------------------------------------


[Institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/before-buying-stocks-check-the-institutional-ownership/) plays another key role in the Tesla vs. Meta stock story.


Along with Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet, Meta made this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-billions-in-this-unexpected-list-of-7-magnificent-stocks-including-nvidia/). In fact, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia each took in over well over $1 billion from these top money managers. Tesla has not made this list since [August](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/meta-stock-tesla-google-panw-lead-ai-stocks-to-watch-as-best-mutual-funds-fuel-artificial-intelligence-lovefest/).


The ratings for all the Magnificent Seven stocks further highlight the gap between Meta and Tesla. For example, while [Meta](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-meta-platforms-meta.aspx) joins [Nvidia](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.aspx) in sporting the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, [Tesla](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-tsla.aspx) earns a lowly 43.


The [up/volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) is another key measure of interest among investors. Where anything above 1.0 points to demand, Meta scores a 1.6, while Tesla rates 0.8.

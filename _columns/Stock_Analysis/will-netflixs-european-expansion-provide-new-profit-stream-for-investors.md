Today we'll check in on **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which now has over 48 million members in 40 countries.

  

In addition to DVD rentals and unlimited streaming of TV shows and movies, Netflix now also creates original programming, including Orange is the New Black and House of Cards.

  

Last month, CEO Reed Hastings announced an expansion into six new European markets, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After a sharp drop in earnings growth in 2012, Netflix has bounced back with multiple quarters of triple-digit gains.

  

Sales growth has also picked up, coming in between 20% to 24% over the last four quarters.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 97%, followed by a 67% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Overall, the stock scores a 92 Composite Rating, up from a 55 at the end of April.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also rebounded, from a D in April to its current B+. That's a sign of demand for the stock, as is the 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

The number of funds that own Netflix has been on the rise in recent quarters, and four typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock: T Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), Legg Mason Opportunity Trust C (LMOPX), Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX) and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After years as a market leader, Netflix sold off sharply in 2011 and 2012. That came as earnings growth slowed dramatically and the company lost millions of members due to unpopular and poorly handled price changes.

  

But Netflix bolted higher in January 2013 when it reported a strong quarter of unexpected profitability. From there, the stock rose steadily, generally finding good support along its 10-week line.

  

In March, Netflix hit resistance and headed lower. That was at least partly due to fears that Apple would get serious about Apple TV and steal market share from Netflix.

  

In late April, the stock flashed a bearish reversal, where it bumped its ahead against the 10-week line and closed at the bottom of the range for the week and below the 40-week line.

  

Volume was huge, over 100% higher than normal. And that was on top of earlier weeks of heavy selling in the left side of the base.

  

This particular bearish reversal came on news that Netflix had lost a bidding war with Amazon to get exclusive streaming rights to certain HBO content.

  

But Netflix managed to find a bottom and bounce back the very next week. And note how the low in the current base undercut the low in the prior pattern. That resets the base count, making the current consolidation a first-stage base.

  

It's not clear yet if this will be a cup-shaped base, or if Netflix will form a handle. If it ends up being a cup, the ideal buy point would be 458.10, ten cents above the peak on the left. If it becomes a cup-with-handle, the ideal buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx) shows that Netflix's 92 Composite Rating is tops among the 25 stocks in its Leisure â€” Movies & Related industry group. The group itself ranks 54 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

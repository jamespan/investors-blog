As the holding company for Silicon Valley Bank, **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) says it's "at the intersection of innovation and capital." And as one of the top [financial stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansachs/), it's trying to find support and cash in on a new potential breakout.

Financial Stocks To Watch
-------------------------


With a 97 Composite Rating, SVB Financial holds the No. 1 ranking among superregional banks. But the industry group ranks a lowly No. 127 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


SVB Financial has posted six quarters of rising earnings and sales growth. Earnings rose 91% in Q2, with a 40% rise in revenue. Boosted by a 42% annual pretax profit margin, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has a solid average annual EPS growth rate of 28%.


The [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has also posted eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership. And 110 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-apple-adobe-ross/) with an A+ IBD rating own shares in the stock.


Will SVB Get Approved For New Breakout?
---------------------------------------


SVB Financial is working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 333.84 entry. In recent days, the stock pulled back and is [testing support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) at its 10-week moving average. It bounced off that benchmark line on Friday in below-average, but rising volume. Early Friday, SVB Financial is up 0.4% to 320.86, putting it around 4% below the buy point.


Since May, the stock has hit resistance around the 330 mark multiple times. See if it can push decisively through that resistance by clearing the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal. Also look for the relative strength line to start moving up and to close in on a new high.


Keep in mind that later-stage bases can work, but they entail more risk, especially in a choppy market as we've seen recently.

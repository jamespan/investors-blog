Fund managers have had their eye — and their money — on **Merit Medical Systems** ([MMSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMSI)) in recent months, and the maker of disposable medical devices for cardiology and radiology has just jumped into a new buy zone.









 
 
 Merit Medical made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/apple-celgene-boeing-unitedhealth-mutual-funds-new-buys/), with 15 funds investing some $8.7 million in Q3.
Industry peers **Cooper Cos.** ([COO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COO)) and **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) also made the cut. Thirty-five top funds picked up $235 million worth of shares in Cooper, while 14 funds invested $17 million in Repligen.


Rebounding Fundamentals
-----------------------


Founded in 1987, Merit Medical serves client hospitals worldwide and employs about 4,500 people.


One factor driving interest in the company among top fund managers is a solid rebound in Merit's top- and bottom-line growth.


After several quarters of tepid, single-digit gains, the Utah-based company rebounded in Q3 2016 with a 30% spike in earnings and a 15% gain in sales.


Revenue growth has ranged from 14% to 24% over the last three quarters, and EPS gains have averaged 38% over the same period.


The company is expected to report Q3 earnings on Oct. 24. Analysts are looking for earning-per-share growth of 15%.


For the full year, the consensus estimate calls for a 25% gain, followed by a 13% rise in 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Further evidence of institutional demand is reflected in a A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio, and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Leading Stock In Leading Industry Group
---------------------------------------


Merit Medical is a member of the Medical-Products industry group. It earns a 98 Composite Rating, putting it just behind **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **Lemaitre Vascular** ([LMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMAT)) and **Orasure Technologies** ([OSUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSUR)) which all earn the highest-possible 99 rating.


The group ranks No. 19 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Breakout Watch
--------------


On Monday, Merit Medical punched through a 42.70 entry in volume that came in more than double its daily average. The buy zone extends to 44.84.



Keep in mind that the stock has nearly tripled in price since finding a bottom at the beginning of last year, and the recent breakout is from a later-stage base.


Such later-stage patterns can lead to nice climbs, but they entail more risk so be sure to follow [defensive sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) and use a [selling check list](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IBD_SellingChecklist.pdf) if the breakout stumbles or fails.


That said, recent technical action is encouraging. Merit Medical has consistently found support at its 10-week line during its run and within the most recent base.


Plus, the relative strength line entered new high ground as the stock cleared the buy point — a bullish sign for a new breakout.


On Wednesday, Merit Medical rose 0.8%, putting it the very upper end of the buy range. Volume was above average.

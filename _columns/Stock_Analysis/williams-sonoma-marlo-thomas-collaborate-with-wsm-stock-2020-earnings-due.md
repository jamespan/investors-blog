With earnings due March 17, home furnishings retailer **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) is designing a potential breakout to a new all-time high.




The San Francisco-based company bills itself as "the world's largest digital-first, design-led and sustainable home retailer." In addition to the Williams-Sonoma flagship, its other brands include Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, West Elm and Rejuvenation.


Williams-Sonoma has posted two straight quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth. In fiscal Q3, the retailer reported 151% EPS growth and a 22% increase in sales.


Analysts expect the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member to deliver 58% earnings growth in fiscal Q4 and 75% for fiscal 2020.


Joining fellow retail stocks **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), WSM stock made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-growth-stocks-pins-schw-pypl-etsy/).


Further indicating strong [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), WSM stock sports a 1.9 up/down volume ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 19 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in William-Sonoma. Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) also owns the stock.


Williams-Sonoma, Marlo Thomas Dish Up New Designs
-------------------------------------------------


[Williams-Sonoma has teamed up with Marlo Thomas](https://ir.williams-sonomainc.com/investor-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/WILLIAMS-SONOMA-AND-POTTERY-BARN-LAUNCH-NEW-COLLABORATION-WITH-AWARD-WINNING-ACTRESS-MARLO-THOMAS/default.aspx), activist and star of the 1960s hit TV show *That Girl*, to dish up "The Marlo Thomas Collection."


An avid collector and world traveler, Thomas has assembled a treasure trove of tabletops and other items that she has used to inspire designs for Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn customers.


Items in the collection include the Marlo Thomas Wine Chiller and the Marlo Thomas Cheese Dome.


WSM Stock Nears Breakout, RS High
---------------------------------


Williams-Sonoma was recently highlighted in the [IBD Screen Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stocks-showing-rising-profit-estimates-williams-sonoma-brunswick-svb-financial-simply-good-foods/) as it showed [rising relative strength](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/). In a sign of stock market leadership, the weekly [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is just below a new 52-week high.


As the general market and retail stocks like Etsy, Five Below and DKS has made impressive moves off the coronavirus lows, WSM stock has also risen sharply.


With the market trend now changed into a confirmed uptrend, the test for Williams-Sonoma will be Q4 earnings on March 17.


Keeping in mind that its risky to buy any stock just before it reports earnings, see if Williams-Sonoma can report well and punch through its 151.26 buy point in strong volume.

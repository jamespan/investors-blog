Including a new breakout into buy range from a rare but powerful base, here are four reasons to watch cancer diagnostics company **Veracyte** ([VCYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VCYT)).




1. Attention-Grabbing Growth With An AI Twist
---------------------------------------------


Veracyte provides clinicians with insights to help guide in the race to diagnose and treat cancer. Tapping into artificial intelligence technologies, the Veracyte Diagnostics Platform supplies cancer tests fueled by broad genomic and clinical data and deep bioinformatic capabilities.


The company has delivered two quarters of accelerating sales growth, including a 29% year-over-year gain to $115.9 million in the second quarter.


Earnings growth has been even more impressive. After posting EPS gains of 100% and 150% in Q1 and Q2, Veracyte generated 94% earnings growth to 33 cents per share in the third quarter.


For the full year, analysts forecast a profit of 36 cents a share. The company lost money in the prior years. Wall Street expects a 67% profit gain to 60 cents a share in 2025.


2. Veracyte Garners Strong Institutional Demand
-----------------------------------------------


In addition to a strong B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/), [Veracyte](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-veracyte-vcyt.aspx) sports a 1.5 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Both metrics point to strong institutional demand for the stock.


Plus, 13 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD own shares of the stock.


With a [92 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-veracyte-vcyt.aspx), Veracyte ranks No. 1 among its peers in IBD's Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group.


3. Soaring Relative Strength
----------------------------


Clear market leadership, as evidenced by Veracyte's sharply rising [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/), offers another reason to monitor the stock.


The big spike in the RS line to a 52-week high shows that Veracyte is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. The stock's strong 95 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/rs-line-vs-rs-rating-which-is-the-better-stock-indicator) shows that it is outpacing 95% of stocks in IBD's database.


4. Veracyte Ascends Into Buy Range
----------------------------------


After suffering a long slump since 2021, the stock sparked a rebound following a 150% spike in earnings growth in the second quarter of this year.


Veracyte then formed an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/), a rare but powerful chart pattern. Beginning in August, Veracyte worked on that pattern until launching a breakout on Tuesday.


After rising over 4% that day, the stock jumped out to a new 52-week high on Wednesday before pulling back. But Veracyte remains in buy range from the 41.43 buy point, the session 4% above that entry.

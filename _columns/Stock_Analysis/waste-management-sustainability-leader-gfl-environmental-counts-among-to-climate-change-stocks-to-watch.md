When thinking of the best climate change stocks to invest in, names like **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)), **ChargePoint** ([CHPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHPT)), **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **Clean Harbors** ([CLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLH)) may come to mind. But waste management and sustainability leader **GFL Environmental** ([GFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFL)), which is poised to launch a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), could offer a chance to make some green.




[Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/) has driven right beyond its recent [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/), while Enphase and ChargePoint seek a chance to recharge. Meanwhile, GFL and CLH stock join the list of leaders in the Pollution Control [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


Other top-rated peers among various waste management, sustainability and general climate change stocks include **Tetra Tech** ([TTEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTEK)), **Heritage-Crystal Clean** ([HCCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCCI)), **Republic Services** ([RSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSG)) and **Ceco Environmental** ([CECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CECO)).


GFL's industry ranks a middling No. 74 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Climate Change Watch: GFL Among Top Names In Waste Management, Sustainability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


While GFL did not join Clear Harbors on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-pour-money-into-apple-stock-msft-software-stocks-and-semiconductors/), it has flashed sighs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-i-in-can-slim-how-institutional-investors-can-make-or-break-growth-stocks-a-key-to-profitable-investing/).


Thirty-three funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD own shares in GFL stock. **Fidelity Contrafund** ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) also has a position in the waste management and sustainability firm. GFL Environmental earns a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), indicating large investors have done more buying than selling of shares over the last 13 weeks.


Despite a less-than-ideal 84 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?), note how Wall Street's forecasts for the 2020 IPO's earnings stack up against its peers. Analysts expect a 94% EPS spike this year.

GFL Generates Green From Waste Management, Sustainability Efforts
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario, the Canadian firm is North America's only major diversified environmental services company offering services in solid waste management, liquid waste management, and soil remediation. Operating across Canada and the United States, GFL can address virtually any environmental challenge through its integrated approach. The company delivers solutions traditionally provided by multiple third parties — all from a single organization.


In May, GFL took home the [2023 SEAL Business Sustainability Award](https://investors.gflenv.com/English/news/news-details/2023/GFL-Environmental-Inc.-Awarded-2023-SEAL-Business-Sustainability-Award/default.aspx).


In line with its focus on sustainability, revenue gains have been solid and steady. Including a 28% year-over-year gain to roughly $1.8 billion in Q1, sales growth has ranged from 17% to 40% over the last eight quarters.


In Q1, the company reported earnings per share of 8 cents, a 33% year-over-year gain.


GFL Stock Continues To Rise — With Fresh Buy Point Ahead
--------------------------------------------------------


Since beginning to climb off its October 2022 low, GFL Environmental has risen steadily, largely right along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The stock has just jumped past a 38.26 buy point in a first-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#flatbase). Such early stage patterns have a higher likelihood of success than later-stage patterns.


As the sustainability and waste management firm breaks out into buy range, keep an eye on the [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). GFL Environmental rose nearly 2% Friday to close in buy range at 38.79. Volume was below average.

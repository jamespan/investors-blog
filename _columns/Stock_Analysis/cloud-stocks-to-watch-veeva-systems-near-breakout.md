With the highest possible 99 Composite Rating and a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), leading medical software company **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) is certainly among the top [cloud stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/). Plus, it's now trying to complete its base and bounce into a new buy zone.




Veeva shares top billing among cloud-based medical software stocks with **Athenahealth** ([ATHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHN)) and **Medidata Solutions** ([MDSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDSO)). The group ranks No. 2 among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, up from No. 4 on Monday.


While Veeva did not make IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-new-buys-adobe-abiomed-macys-kohls/), it has seen two quarters of rising fund ownership. Its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio further confirm institutional demand for shares.

--------------------------------------------

From the largest [Big Pharma companies to emerging biotechs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), Veeva has more than 625 customers around the world. Its client roster includes **GlaxoSmithKline** ([GSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK)), **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Bayer** ([BAYRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAYRY)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)).


Veeva sports strong annual three-year growth rates for both earnings (37%) and revenue (30%). The company also boasts a 32% annual pretax profit margin and a 19% return on equity.


On May 24, Veeva beat analyst estimates with a 43% spike in earnings for Q1 of fiscal 2019 (ended April 30). For fiscal Q2, analysts expect a 47% increase. The company has not yet announced the date of its next quarterly report.


Cloud Stocks Floating Near New Buy Zone
---------------------------------------


Veeva is working on a later-stage flat base, one of the [three most common and profitable chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The potential buy point is 85.10. The stock has shown good support at the 10-week line within the base, and its relative strength line is just below a new 52-week high.


Note how the bottom of its current flat base formed right around the buy point in its prior double bottom. Such action is a healthy sign of support and may mean the stock is forming steppingstones for a continued climb.


On Tuesday, Veeva reversed sharply to a 4.3% decline, putting it 6% below the entry. Preliminary volume was below average, but rising. See if the stock can find support at the 10-week line and rebound to punch through the buy point in strong volume.

The rise of mobile computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution are game-changing trends, and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) has been at the forefront of both.

  

It makes near-field communications (NFC) chips that serve a variety of functions, including enabling mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay.

  

Like fellow chipmakers **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), NXP has gotten a big boost as a supplier for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and Apple Watch. Earlier this month, Samsung said it will use the firm's chips in Galaxy S6 smartphones made for the Chinese market.

  

Based in the Netherlands and formerly known as Philips Semiconductors, NXP is also involved in the connected car and cybersecurity markets.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth has ranged from 36% to 77% over the past eight reports, and the company has delivered double-digit revenue gains for six consecutive quarters.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 22%, followed by a 13% gain in 2016. Keep in mind that the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and estimates for both years have recently been revised lower. So see if those projections pick up.

  

NXP has a stellar 129% return on equity, but a high debt-to-equity ratio. A heavy debt load can cause problems if interest rates rise significantly.

  

Helped by a 76% annual EPS growth rate, NXP earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. And the number of funds with a position in the stock has risen in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Back in October, most chip stocks, including NXP, sold off on fear that the semiconductor industry was entering a downturn.

  

The silver lining of that drop was that it [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) for NXP when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern. That made the stock's rather V-shaped cup a first-stage base.

  

After edging higher as it climbed along its 10-week line, NXP formed a three-weeks-tight pattern in February, just before announcing it would buy **Freescale Semiconductor** ([FSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSL)).

  

The stock gapped up on that news and is working on a second-stage, flat base.

  

The sharp selloff on the left side of that pattern was somewhat disconcerting, since volume was well above average and rising.

  

But the overall market at the time was under pressure and there were a couple of mitigating factors.

  

First, on March 26, NXP managed to bounce back and close near the top of the price range.

  

Second, it closed above the bottom of the earlier gap up.

  

The stock found similar support in April, when it continued to close above the low end of the March gap up.

  

In recent days, NXP has been flashing tight closes as it tries to zero in on the 108.60 buy point. See if the stock can punch through that price on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

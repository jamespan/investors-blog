With the market under pressure and high-profile stocks such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) running into trouble, it's a challenging environment for investors.

  

But it's critical to [keep building your watch list](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/616628-5-steps-for-building-and-maintaining-a-profitable-watch-list.aspx) with an eye on stocks that have strong fundamentals and are showing signs of resilience. **ComScore** ([SCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCOR)), an analytics firm that measures online audience behavior, so far fits that bill.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

ComScore's sales growth has moved higher for three straight quarters. Earnings accelerated from 19% to 29% in Q4. ComScore is scheduled to report first-quarter numbers May 5.

  

The company sports a strong 27% return on equity, and its 98 Composite Rating and 95 Relative Strength Rating both earn a "Best in Group" score among its industry peers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since bottoming in 2012, the stock has surged 350%, forming several bases along the way.

  

ComScore bolted higher after reporting Q4 numbers Feb. 12, closing up 21% for the week. It's now working on a new base and, at least so far, has shown tight trading with good support along the 10-week line.

  

After climbing right along its 10-day line for several weeks, ComScore fell below that short-term benchmark April 27 and slipped further below it Thursday in rising volume.

  

If ComScore continues to pull back, see if volume lightens up and if the stock finds support at the 10-week line.

  

The buy point is 54.71, 10 cents above the high of the handle in the cup-with-handle base. But note that it's a later-stage base, and the general market is now under pressure. Also, ComScore's May 5 earnings report could push the stock either up or down.

 Three big buzz IPOs from **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) all got off to a slow start, but premium apparel maker **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) may be getting ready to soar.
Facebook and Snap both quickly headed south following their initial public offerings. It took 14 months before Facebook's stock began to take off as Team Zuckerberg found its mobile mojo and began churning out exceptional earnings growth. Time will tell if Snap follows a similar path.


Since its Mar. 16 market debut, Canada Goose has so far traded more like Alibaba at the time of its 2014 IPO and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) when it went public as Google in 2004.


Alibaba quickly formed a cup-shaped [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) and broke out to a 20% gain, but then fell into a multiyear slump — a good reminder that new IPOs can be volatile and should be handled with caution and sound [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/).


Google, on the other hand, quickly formed an IPO base that launched a strong and sustained move.


Now the question is, will Canada Goose migrate north or south?


Puffy Profits
-------------


Unlike fellow 2017 IPOs Snap and **Invitation Homes** ([INVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVH)), Canada Goose is actually profitable, with a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 118% and a 19% annual pretax profit margin.


Sales have grown at an average 31% clip over the last three years.


The company was founded in 1957 in a small warehouse in Toronto, and now sells down jackets and other outerwear in 36 countries.


Canada Goose has not yet announced a date for its Q1 earnings report, its first since going public.


In 2016, the company opened its flagship stores in Toronto and New York City. The bulk of its U.S. sales come from the Northeast, which the company says leaves significant opportunities for growth in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions.


Taking Flight?
--------------


Canada Goose has formed its first base, showing a 18.50 buy point.



The stock has not traded long enough to have an Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which takes a minimum of 13 weeks, but it does have a strong 3.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


It has also shown signs of institutional buying in the right side of the base, and 36 A- or higher rated funds, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), have taken a position in the stock.


In another sign of technical strength, the relative strength line is already in new high ground.


But keep in that Canada Goose faces its first earnings report as a publicly traded company, and only time will tell if it follows the trajectory of Google or Alibaba in the coming weeks and months.


**Update:** The stock rose over 2% Tuesday, ending the session just pennies below the 18.50 - 19.43 buy zone it had entered earlier in the day. At over 1.5 million shares exchanging hands, volume was more than triple that of the previous day.

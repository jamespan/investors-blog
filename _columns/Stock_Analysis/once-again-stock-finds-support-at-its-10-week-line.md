**Informatica** ([INFA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFA)) is holding up well in a tough market environment and may make a good watch list candidate.

  

The stock breached the low of a base in May 2010, thus resetting its base count 1. It recovered and broke out of another pattern in July, staging a breakaway gap 2.

  

The stock has been in a strong uptrend since then.

  

In March of this year, Informatica cleared a 49.86 buy point from a flat base 3. That was a second-stage pattern.

  

Informatica was able to muster a rebound after the first pullback to the 10-week line since the breakout. The stock made a new high but reversed lower in heavy trading 4. That showed institutional investors sold shares. It's much more preferable when a pullback occurs in light volume.

  

Nonetheless, Informatica has again found support at the 10-week line. With its decline now four weeks old, it's possible that Informatica is forming another base.

  

Informatica's Relative Strength line is already at a new high 5, which is a bullish characteristic. Its up/down volume ratio also is favorable.

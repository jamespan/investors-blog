Today we'll look at **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)), a financial and professional services firm that specializes in commercial real estate and investment management worldwide.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Both sales and earnings growth have been on the rise in recent quarters, and Jones Lang LaSalle beat estimates in both categories in the fourth quarter. Earnings growth jumped to 28%, and revenue gains also accelerated for the third consecutive quarter.

  

The company is scheduled to report first-quarter numbers on April 28, so watch to see if that trend continues.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 16%, followed by a 14% gain in 2015.

  

Jones Lang LaSalle's 14% return on equity is a bit below the 17% minimum you'd prefer to see, but overall the stock scores the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

And institutional investors have taken note. The stock has a solid A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a strong 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

And after dipping lower last year, the number of funds that own shares rose last quarter. Also, three typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: RS Partners (RSPFX), Columbia Acorn Z (ACRNX) and Alger Small Cap Growth B (ALSCX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Jones Lang LaSalle sold off sharply in 2011 and continued to struggle for about two years. Then, as you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, it broke out of a long, first-stage consolidation in December.

  

Note the tight, orderly trading that followed, with good support along the 50-day moving average. That's healthy and was a sign that institutional investors were quietly picking up shares within that price range.

  

The stock then soared 5% higher on Jan. 29 after a strong fourth-quarter earnings report. That came on volume 273% above average.

  

After hitting a new high on March 6, the stock pulled back to start forming its current flat base.

  

Note how the green 10-day line is now below the red 50-day line. That's the opposite of what you want to see.

  

But it's a positive sign when the 10-day pushes back above the 50-day, so see if that happens in the coming days.

  

The ideal buy point in this second-stage pattern is 125.39, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

With the market currently in a correction, it's best to avoid new buys. But with Jones Lang LaSalle scheduled to report earnings on April 28, it may be one to watch.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-jones-lang-lasalle-inc-jll.aspx) shows Jones Lang LaSalle's 99 Composite Rating is the best among the 47 stocks in its Real Estate Development/Operations industry group.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 12 among IBD's 197 industries.

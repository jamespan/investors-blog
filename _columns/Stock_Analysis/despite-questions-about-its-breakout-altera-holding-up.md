Chipmaker **Altera** ([ALTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALTR)) continues its moderate price action as it tries to fight off the market's correction.

  

The stock formed a cup-with-handle pattern in March and April **1**. It was shorter than normal, lasting six weeks rather than the usual minimum of seven. It was also somewhat lopsided.

  

Still, Altera broke out on April 20 in heavy trading past a 44.47 buy point. Volume on the day of the breakout was 35% above average â€” less than the 40% increase that would be more indicative of institutional buying.

  

Nonetheless, Altera managed to move into new highs.

  

But as the market fell into a correction, Altera also pulled back. Starting in late April, Altera formed a three-weeks-tight pattern **2**.

  

But rather than break out of that pattern, it continued pulling back and has come near its 10-week moving average **3**. It found support there, and it may form a buying range in a better market.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating **4** and up/down volume ratio **5** also are showing that institutional investors continue to like the stock.

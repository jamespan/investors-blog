While Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders may not agree on many issues, they do share at least one policy goal: to significantly increase spending on America's aging infrastructure.


So regardless of who becomes president, construction-related firms like **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) stand to get a boost from a [new influx of public spending](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/markets-for-this-gravel-supplier-are-solid-as-a-rock/) to repair roads and bridges and expand public transportation.


Industry Group Rising
---------------------


Based in Birmingham, AL, Vulcan provides rocks, gravel, sand, asphalt mix and ready-mix concrete to the construction and paving industries.


Its 96 Composite Rating ranks No. 2 within the Building – Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, behind **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) and ahead of **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)), **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) and Summit Materials ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)).


Shares of Vulcan and other industry leaders have been rising since January, boosted by a $305 billion highway bill that Congress passed and President Obama signed in December. The group ranking has jumped to No. 79, up from No. 125 just four weeks ago.


Vulcan Materials has posted double-digit sales growth for five consecutive quarters. Earnings growth has accelerated for three straight reports, spiking to 139% in Q4.


Analysts expect EPS to rise 69% this year, followed by a 36% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


The number of mutual funds with a position in Vulcan has been on the rise in recent quarters and two typically better-performing funds own shares, including MFS Growth ([MFEGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFEGX)).


Can Vulcan Deliver Rock-Solid Breakout?
---------------------------------------


Vulcan Materials reset its base count in January, when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern, making its current base a first-stage consolidation.

The 10-week line has also climbed back above the 40-week moving average, a sign of renewed technical strength.


A Feb. 4 gap up on earnings was another positive indicator within the base, especially since it came on volume 122% above average. But since then, trading has been relatively quiet.


The stock has shown tight trading in recent weeks, as it floats right around a 105.79 buy point. Look for Vulcan Materials to clear that entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal to show conviction behind the move.

Institutional investors fuel transformational trends on Wall Street — like the current boom in artificial intelligence. Unveiling huge bets on **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and other AI stocks, this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/meta-stock-tesla-google-panw-lead-ai-stocks-to-watch-as-best-mutual-funds-fuel-artificial-intelligence-lovefest/) showcases where the smart money is flowing. And triggered by an aggressive move into generative AI, Adobe stock also landed on this exclusive list, raking in over $426 million from top money managers.




Further illustrating the demand for the best [AI stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) sports an A [Acumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/). That indicates heavy buying of Adobe shares over the last 13 weeks. On the table below, only [Meta stock](https://www.investors.com/news/is-meta-stock-still-a-buy-after-facebook-parent-surges-on-earnings-outlook/), which has now fallen below its 50-day line, shares an A rating with Adobe stock.


Also note that Adobe stock sports a very strong 2.2 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-up-down-volume-ratio-spots-underlying-demand-for-stocks/). For that metric, anything above 1.0 points to demand.


While widespread demand remains for companies [TSLA](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/), [GOOGL](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) tapping into the AI zeitgeist, the new market correction has put pressure on their Accumumluation/Distribution ratings.


While **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) failed to make this month's list of new buys by top funds, the AI giant [remains committed to its merger](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-activision-blizzard-still-committed-to-75-billion-merger-sources-say-6362ca13) with **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), which did make the list. After leading funds invested $1.5 billion in [MSFT stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) in the [July report](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/tesla-stock-revs-up-demand-alongside-msft-stock-axon-oracle-and-more/), the best mutual funds shoveled an estimated $808 million into ATVI stock in this month's screen.

Adobe Generating Demand With Generative AI
------------------------------------------


The best-run companies make material pivots at pivotal times. Just as Microsoft and Google placed huge — and successful — bets on their moves into [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), Adobe has thrived by shifting to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription model.


At the same time, the Silicon Valley-based company has also aggressively expanded a leading position in analytics, integrating its cloud-based creative and marketing offerings.


Now, just as Google has with Bard and Microsoft has with Bing AI, Adobe continues to enhance and expand its presence in the artificial intelligence space with [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html), [Adobe Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html) and [Adobe SenseiGenAI](https://business.adobe.com/products/sensei/adobe-sensei-genai.html).


Across all of these offerings, Adobe utilizes generative AI to create content, target specific audiences and power compelling and engaging customer experiences. Adobe has even expanded its [generative AI tool to over 100 languages](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-adobe-expands-generative-ai-tool-to-over-100-languages/).


Meanwhile, the drive into AI helped Adobe accelerate Q2 fiscal 2023 earnings per share to $3.91, a 17% year-over-year gain. That was also up from a 13% EPS increase in fiscal Q1. While Wall Street forecasts a 9% earnings slowdown for the current fiscal year, analysts expect 11% earnings growth for the next fiscal year.


Although Adobe doesn't join Microsoft stock on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/?) list, it does boast a strong Earnings Stability rating of 5. For this rating, the lower the number, the more stable the earnings performance.


Adobe Stock Blasts Off And Holds Support
----------------------------------------


After reporting fiscal Q2 earnings on June 15, Adobe gapped up in heavy volume. As a result of that move, Adobe stock zoomed into a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-buy-zone-is-the-sweet-spot/) above a 451.15 buy point. It added to those gains before drifting sideways in healthy action in late June and early July.


Additionally, Adobe stock popped up to a 52-week high on Aug. 1 before easing back in light volume to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It has now slipped below that benchmark line.


Following the strong breakout in June, ADBE stock pulled back to around its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). In a good market, a bounce off that line can offer investors a chance to pick up more shares in Adobe stock or start establishing a new position. But selling pressure in the market indexes calls for caution.


With Meta stock losing support at its 10-week line and Google holding the bottom of its buy range, Adobe stock looks to keep riding the still-intact AI boom. On Friday, Adobe pulled back but found support at its 50-day line.


As always, investors need to keep monitoring the general market indexes. This week's downgrade into a market correction puts investors on notice to take defensive action. Keep in mind that the [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) has dropped to 20%-40% (down from 40%-60%) due to selling pressure in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

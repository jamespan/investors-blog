The U.S. shale drilling boom has sparked big changes in the natural gas industry. One of them is the increase in exports of low-cost, liquefied natural gas — also called LNG.

  

That's sparked a race to build new LNG plants, especially along the Gulf Coast.

  

And one of the most active players in that buildout is **CB&I** ([CBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBI)), which was featured in the Sept. 24 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/092313-672112-chicago-bridge-and-iron-competes-for-lng.htm). It's still often called Chicago Bridge & Iron because it got its start building bridges and other structures in the 1800s.

  

Today it refers to itself as a "complete energy infrastructure firm," and designs, engineers, builds and maintains plants around the world.

  

But it's the firm's expertise in building and installing storage tanks for liquids and gases that gives it an edge over their rivals, who usually don't build storage tanks.

  

Analysts say CB&I is also well positioned to play a leading role in the building of petrochemical facilities including those that take ethane — which is also a product of shale gas production — to make ethylene for plastics and other products.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth has been accelerating, hitting 39% last quarter.

  

• Sales growth picked up sharply, coming in most recently at 119%.

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 35% this year and 23% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chicago-bridge-and-iron-co-cbi.aspx) shows CB&I carries the best Composite Rating among the 24 stocks in its Building-Heavy Construction industry group.

  

But the group itself has been a laggard — and only ranked 134 among IBD's 197 groups. So it has not been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows CB&I spent the summer carving out a flat base.

  

Sometimes stocks give investors more than one chance to get onboard. And that's the case with this one.

  

There was an early potential buy point at 62.05. And the stock also gave investors a second opportunity when it passed the high point in the base and the 65.01 buy point.

  

Volume was running about 51% above average as it passed that second potential buy point, which is what you like to see.

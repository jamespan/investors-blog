After rising 342% off its coronavirus lows in March, **Capital One Financial** ([COF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COF)) is trying to cash in with a new breakout. Boosted by 579% Q2 earnings growth, COF stock is 4% shy of a 168.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




As its share price has soared, Capital One has been refinancing its fundamentals. In both Q1 and Q2, the Virginia-based consumer and commercial lender posted strong triple-digit EPS growth. But note that both numbers are based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss.


Sales growth has picked up. After showing five quarters of subpar revenue growth, Capital One moved into positive ground with a 5% increase.


While Capital One did not join fellow financial stocks **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/googl-stock-nvidia-lead-latest-list-of-new-buys-by-the-best-mutual-funds/), 42 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported a position in COF stock.


Plus, COF stock has seen three straight quarters of rising fund ownership.

Capital One Among Leaders In Consumer Loans Group
-------------------------------------------------


With a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Capital One earns a spot among the top-rated stocks in the consumer loans [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-stock-market-winners-watch-changing-industry-group-power/).


**Level One Bancorp** ([LEVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEVL)) tops the group with the highest-possible 99 rating. **Atlanticus** ([ATLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATLC)), **Credit Acceptance** ([CACC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CACC)), and **OneMain Financial** ([OMF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMF)) also rank highly within the industry, which is No. 6 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


After posting 579% EPS growth in Q2, analysts expect a 3% slowdown in the third quarter. But for the full year, Wall Street sees Capital One delivering 306% earnings growth.


Capital One Building Stage-One Base
-----------------------------------


Despite the huge rise off its coronavirus lows in March 2020, COF stock is technically still in a [first-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). While an early-stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) is positive, investors should keep in mind that Capital One has already made a big move.


In a sign of strength, since returning to its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) in July 2020, COF stock has generally found support right along that benchmark line. While working on its current flat base, Capital One has been moving right along the 10-week line.


On Thursday, Capital One rose 1.5%. Volume was below average but rising. The stock slipped over 1% in below-average volume Friday. It closed right around its 50-day moving average.


With earnings behind it, see if COF stock can push past the buy point. Look for volume to be at least 40% above average on any breakout attempt.

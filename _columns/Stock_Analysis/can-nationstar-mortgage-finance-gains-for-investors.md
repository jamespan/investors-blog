There have been some interesting changes in the mortgage industry the past few years in the wake of the housing bubble: some big banks have reduced or completely gotten out of the mortgage servicing business.

  

And as a Sept. 26 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/092513-672451-nationstar-mortgage-servicing-bank-of-america.htm) noted, that's created opportunities for mortgage servicers like **Nationstar Mortgage** ([NSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSM)), which collects loan payments from homeowners and delivers the money to investors, including mortgage backed securities trusts.

  

The firm currently has about $312 billion worth of mortgages they services. And analysts predict they will be buying more.

  

Theys also note Nationstar has been capitalizing on the changes in the mortgage industry.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•You can see that in their earnings growth, which has been very strong in recent quarters.

  

• Sales growth has been in the triple digits.

  

• Things weren't always so rosy. The company started in 2007, shortly before the housing industry ran into trouble. And it racked up losses for four straight years.

  

• But recently things have turned around. And analysts predict earnings will climb a hefty 101% this year and 49% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-nationstar-mtg-hldgs-inc-nsm.aspx) shows Nationstar carries a 98 Composite Rating. That ties it with **HFF** ([HF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HF)) for the No. 4 spot in the Finance-Mortgage industry group. Only **Ocwen Financial** ([OCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCN)) is rated higher.

  

The industry group itself is also strong — in fact it's the second highest among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith chart on this page, last month Nationstar broke out of a four-weeks-tight pattern .

  

That pattern occurs when a stock's closing price each week is within about 1% of the previous week's close for three weeks in a row. In this case Natationstar traded in that tight range for four weeks.

  

To find the buy point, just add 10 cents to the peak in the pattern.

  

After breaking out it hit a series of new highs. Then paused and pulled back.

  

Watch to see if it continues to pull back and if it can find support at the 10-week line. Or if it goes on to form a base pattern.

  

With those strong earnings, it may be worth a spot on your watch list.

After announcing an agreement to buy chip designer Arm from **SoftBank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)) in September, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has sprinted into a new buy zone. The deal is valued at $40 billion.




The deal with SoftBank enables [Nvidia to combine its artificial intelligence](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/10/28/softbank-nvidia/?nvid=nv-int-cwmfg-55540#cid=ixz_nv-int-cwmfg_en-us) (AI) computing platform with Arm's extensive ecosystem. The new combination is a key part of Nvidia's drive to expand its vision for the future of AI technology.


"In the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than today's internet-of-people," says Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. "Our combination will create a company fabulously positioned for the age of AI."


NVDA Stock Jumps Ahead Of Earnings
----------------------------------


Evolving from the inventor of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, Nvidia has pioneered GPU deep learning and AI technology. Today, the GPU acts as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars.


Even before the Arm acquisition, Nvidia has been growing rapidly. The Silicon Valley-based company has generated average EPS growth of 105% over the last three quarters. It's set to report fiscal 2021 Q3 numbers on Nov. 18, with analysts expecting 44% growth.


Consensus analyst estimates call for a 58% EPS gain this fiscal year, followed by a 21% increase in fiscal 2022.


NVDA stock has earned a spot on IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/fang-stocks-best-mutual-funds-buy-amazon-google-parent-alphabet-facebook/). An impressive 483 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own NVDA stock, including Fidelity OTC (FOCPX). The stock has also seen seven straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Along with fellow chip designers **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), NVDA stock merits the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The score means Nvidia is outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of the key [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Nvidia is featured on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


NVDA Stock
----------


On Friday, Nvidia has jumped into a new buy zone after shaping a later-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The stock is still within buy zone after clearing its 574.04 buy point.


Nvidia is also back above its 21-day and 50-day moving averages, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) hitting a new 52-week high.


Look for the stock market to build on its recent gains, and see if NVDA stock can ride that trend to a new breakout and all-time high.

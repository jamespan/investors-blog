With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) earns the No. 1 ranking among solar stocks. SEDG stock also made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-microsoft-apple-facebook-google-lead-stocks-to-buy-watch/).




From February to April, 10 of these top-performing funds scooped up $67 million worth of SEDG stock. In a further sign of strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), 53 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning SolarEdge shares, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).


A 99 Composite Rating means that SolarEdge stock is outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Best Mutual Funds Warm Up To SolarEdge
--------------------------------------


Like the general market and most stocks, SolarEdge took a sudden and dramatic hit in February and March as the coronavirus pandemic spread. But as the market has rebounded, SEDG stock has come sharply off its lows and is back just below its all-time highs.


In addition to solid support among the best mutual funds, one reason for the resilience is SolarEdge's exceptional earnings and sales growth. Over the last three quarters, annual EPS growth has averaged an impressive 83%. And over the last three years, SolarEdge has grown revenue at an average annual pace of 51%.


Based in Israel, SolarEdge has over 2,400 employees and operations in more than 130 countries. As a global leader in smart energy technology, SolarEdge developed an intelligent inverter that changed the way power is harvested and managed in photovoltaic (PV) systems. Since it began shipping in 2010, SolarEdge has shipped 1.5 million inverters and over 45 million power optimizers.


The company has zero debt and sports 19% annual pretax profit margin and 34% return on equty.


SEDG Stock Heats Up After Coronavirus Crash
-------------------------------------------


After losing around 60% of its value in the coronavirus crash, SolarEdge has just as quickly rebounded in a V-shaped formation. Such recoveries can be prone to failure, although that reflects action in the broad market. So it would not be surprising to see SEDG stock cut short its attempted return to hold highs and pull back.


But investors should focus on how the market and leading stocks are behaving right now, rather than try to predict how they will act in the future.


For now, SEDG stock is performing well. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is just below a new 52-week high.After dimming its lights on Thursday, the stock rebounded Friday, finding support at its 10-day moving average.


SolarEdge has now completed a handle to offer a in a cup-with-handle to offer aÂ 141.55 entry. The stock is now testing that buy point, gainingnearly 5% on the last trading day in May. But volume is below average.


See if SEDG stock can keep climbing in stronger trade. But keep in mind that we're in volatile and uncertain times. Be sure to have defensive [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) in place in case the market or your stocks retreat.

With the general market under pressure, even top-rated stocks like **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) feel the heat. But if the indexes hold on and rebound, the private mortgage insurer may put a down payment on a new breakout.


Through subsidiaries including Essent Guaranty and Essent Reinsurance, the Bermuda-based company offers private mortgage insurance for single-family mortgage loans in the U.S. through its subsidiaries. It also provides private capital to lenders to mitigate mortgage credit risk.


Essent's 98 Composite Rating and 99 EPS Rating earn it the No. 1 rank within the property, casualty and title insurance industry group.


The company also sports strong three-year annual growth rates for both earnings (70%) and sales (67%). It also has an exceptionally strong annual pretax profit margin of 64.6%.


In fact, the stock pulls off a feat that few companies do: It currently gets a passing grade for every key fundamental and technical criteria in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-essent-group-ltd-esnt.aspx) except one, with its 15.2% return on equity coming in a bit below the 17% minimum benchmark.


Essent's performance has earned it a spot on both the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) lists of top-performing growth stocks.


But individual stocks don't trade in a vacuum. Strength or weakness in the general market and within a stock's own industry group can significantly impact the stock's performance.


Right now, Essent's group ranks a mediocre No. 68 among the 197 groups IBD tracks and the [current outlook for the general market](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/) stands at "uptrend under pressure," meaning it's a time to maintain a fairly defensive posture and be cautious about making any new buys.


Plus, Essent is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 4, which could send the stock sharply higher or lower, as we saw this week with **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)).


Analysts expect Essent's full-year EPS to rise 33%, followed by a 19% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Searching For Support
---------------------


Since going public in 2013, Essent has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride, including recently resetting its base count by forming a 61-week cup-with-handle.



The stock briefly broke out of that pattern in September, but immediately pulled back to add a flat base to what has become a first-stage base-on-base formation.


Within the bottom of current formation, Essent flashed tight weekly closes and found support at its 10-week moving average.


Such action is healthy, and demand for shares is reflected in the stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio and two straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


But with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting resistance in recent weeks, Essent is also starting to struggle.


In early Thursday trading, the stock gapped down and is now testing support at its 50-day line.


Look to see if the market can rebound and Essent can post a strong Q3 earnings report on Nov. 4.

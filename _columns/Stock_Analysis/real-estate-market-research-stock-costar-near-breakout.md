Rising Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------


CoStar has posted two quarters of increasing top- and bottom-line growth. In Q1 and Q2, earnings growth jumped 57% and 93%, respectively, while revenue rose from 21% to 25%. Analysts expect the Washington, D.C.-based real estate market research firm to post 46% EPS growth in Q3.


Although CoStar's 7% return on equity is below the 17% benchmark you typically look for, it sports a solid 26% annual pretax profit margin.


Signs of institutional demand include a 1.5 up/down volume ratio and eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership.


Room To Keep Climbing?
----------------------


CoStar broke out of a base in April 2017. It rose as much as 99% before pulling back in late July to form its current base. It's a later-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/)Â with a 447.06 buy point.


[Later-stage chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) involve more risk since the stock has already made a substantial move by the time they form. But they can produce solid gains. Just be sure to keep any new buys from a later-stage pattern on a short leash if the trade goes against you.


CoStar closed last week up 1.8% to 442.16, leaving it just 1% below the buy point. In early trading Tuesday, the stock was off marginally as the general market was trending sharply lower.

When Chinese social media stock **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) was [featured in the March 24 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/two-factors-driving-explosive-growth-for-the-twitter-of-china/), it was working on a first-stage base.


The so-called Twitter of China went on to form a handle and broke out in huge volume April 6, launching a 191% run before peaking six months later.


Weibo is now working on a new chart pattern that may generate a renewed climb – if it can fight off the selling pressure it's encountered this week.


Big Stakes For Chinese Stocks Sina, Alibaba
-------------------------------------------


Weibo, which went public in April 2014, was spun off **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), a Chinese internet portal that retains a controlling interest in the company.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) bought an 18% stake prior to Weibo's IPO, then boosted its ownership position to 31.5% in September of this year.


On Nov. 21, [Weibo topped analyst estimates for top and bottom line Q3 numbers](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/china-internet-firms-post-strong-earnings-that-beat-q3-estimates/), posting at least its eighth-straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth. Revenue gains have ranged from 24% to 48% over the last eight reports.


For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 128%, followed by a 63% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years have recently been revised higher.


As of September, Weibo had 297 million monthly active users, a 34% year-over-year increase. 89% of users access its social media platform on mobile devices.


Weibo's 99 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 spot within the Internet–Content industry group, which ranks No. 37 among IBD's 197 groups.


Can Weibo Launch Another Breakout?
----------------------------------


Weibo's current base is technically considered a second-stage pattern, but investors should not ignore the big move it's already made this year.


Trading within the base has been wider and looser than the action showed as it nearly tripled in price from April to October.


Weibo's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate to heavy buying by fund managers over the last 13 weeks, but heavier-volume down days have started to kick in.


In Thursday morning trading, the stock was down nearly 7% in heavy volume as it fell below its 50-day moving average. See if the stock can regain its footing and get back above that benchmark line.



The current buy point is 56.03, but Weibo may be building a handle, which takes a minimum of five days to form.


If the stock does rebound and break out, look for heavy volume to indicate conviction among fund managers. And keep the stock on a tight leash if it starts to flash signs of trouble after a breakout attempt.

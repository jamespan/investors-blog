As **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) and other drugmakers have pushed to develop and mass produce Covid-19 vaccines and related therapies, they've turned to **Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)) for support. That lifted Catalent stock as much as 358% off its 2020 pandemic low until it pulled back in September. This week, the stock has sold off in rising volume.




Along with fellow medical research company **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)), Catalent made last month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-googl-stock-tech-stocks-but-stock-market-correction-hits/). It also made the latest update, which comes out later today.


Working with [biotech and pharmaceutical companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) like [Moderna](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-buy-now/), [JNJ](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/), [AstraZeneca](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/astrazeneca-stock-buy-now/) and dozens of others, Catalent has been awarded work on nearly 100 unique compounds investigated as potential [Covid-19 vaccines](https://www.catalent.com/covid-19/) and therapies. When the pandemic hit, the New Jersey-based company was uniquely positioned to provide or build manufacturing capacity for billions of Covid-19 vaccine doses over the next few years.


In addition to work on the coronavirus, [Catalent recently acquired Bettera Wellness](https://consumerhealth.catalent.com/nutritional-supplements/dose-forms/wellness/), a leading supplier of gummies, soft chews, and lozenges to the nutritional supplement market. Bettera joins the Catalent Consumer Health & Wellness business.


With over 85 years of experience, Catalent supports partners in introducing approximately 200 new products and manufacturing over 70 billion doses each year. It has around 15,000 employees, including around 2,400 scientists and technicians, supporting over 7,000 products for over 1,000 customers all around the world.


Catalent has generated over $1 billion in revenue in each of the last three quarters. Earning a 87 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), the medical researcher has delivered average annual earnings growth of 25% over the last three years. Analysts expect Catalent to post 32% EPS growth in Q4 and a 21% rise for the fiscal year ending in June.


Catalent Joins Fellow Long-Term Leaders On List Of New Buys By Top Funds
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Joining Thermo Fisher, Catalent has earned a spot on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). In fact, the latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds includes many elite long-term leaders. All have impressive track records of solid and stable earnings growth.


Within the medical sector, **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) and **West Pharmaceuticals** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)) also join Catalent on both IBD Long-Term Leaders and the list of new buys by top funds.


Tech titans **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), as well as many other well established and well-run growth stocks, make an appearance on both lists.


CTLT Stock Falls, Tests Support at 40-Week Line
-----------------------------------------------


Catalent had been working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) as part of a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) pattern. After finding support following a pullback from its [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) breakout in August, CTLT stock was setting up a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 142.74. But on Thursday, the stock fell below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) in heavy volume and the descent has continued on Friday.


After rising as Catalent built and broke out of its prior base, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) climbed to just shy of a new high. But the RS line has fallen sharply in recent days.


The next line of defense for Catalent is the 200-day line, so see if it can begin shoring up support at that benchmark.

Even after announcing the end of its partnership to develop the Autopilot system with **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), 2014 IPO **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) is in the driver's seat when it comes to the technology behind semi-autonomous and fully-autonomous cars. But rivals have also been revving up.


On Monday, Mobileye announced it is teaming up with **Delphi Automotive** ([DLPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLPH)) to develop a **[self-driving system to be ready for production in 2019](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mobileye-accelerates-self-driving-car-technology-with-delphi-deal/)**. The news drove Mobileye's stock sharply higher in early trading Tuesday.


Rivals And Partnerships
-----------------------


According to the Israel-based company, Mobileye's technology is already -- or will soon be -- integrated into car models of 25 global automakers.


As a leading provider of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Mobileye has also formed strategic partnerships with **BMW** ([BMWYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMWYY)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), as well as with **Volkswagen** ([VLKAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLKAY)), to make automated driving part of everyday life.


Mobileye has averaged 102% EPS growth over the last three quarters, as well as strong three-year annual growth rates for both earnings (92%) and sales (73%). But both earnings and revenue have grown at a slowing pace for three straight quarters, so look for that trend to turn around.


Within the Auto/Truck-Original Equipment group, Mobileye earns the No. 1 ranking for its [**Composite Rating**](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771) (95), **[EPS Rating](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771)** (99) and **[SMR Rating](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771)** (A), which tracks sales growth, profit margins (51.8%) and return on equity (24.9%) as a whole.


But Mobileye faces strong and rising competition for ADAS technology from several firms, including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) and Japan's Renesas Electronics, which is reported to be in the final stages of a **[$3 billion acquisition](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/japans-renesas-could-overtake-automotive-giant-nxp-with-intersil-bid/)** of chipmaker **Intersil** ([ISIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISIL)).


**Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) has also revealed plans to offer a **[fully autonomous car in five years](https://www.investors.com/news/ford-baidu-make-investment-in-self-driving-technology/)**, and together with **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) is investing $150 million in Velodyne to develop automotive lidar sensors, a key component for self-driving automobiles.


The Road To Recovery?
---------------------


After a sharp decline starting last August, the stock began to gain traction in February.


 It formed a **[double bottom pattern](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2)**, with rising volume in the right side of the base and on the breakout.
It cleared the buy point in June, rising just over 25% before pulling back.


Mobileye found support at the 10-week line, and while it hadn't yet completed a new base, on Tuesday, it bounced off the 10-week moving average and tried to clear a point of resistance hit during the week ended July 22.

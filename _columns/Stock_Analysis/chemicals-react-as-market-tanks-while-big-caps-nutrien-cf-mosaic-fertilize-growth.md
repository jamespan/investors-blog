Russia invades Ukraine. Inflation soars. Stocks tank. There's no shortage of troubling news out there. Yet large-cap chemical stocks, including **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)), spark one bright spot in the darkness. Fellow industry leaders **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) are also shining.




Nutrien, CF and Mosaic have also secured a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) list of leading large-cap growth stocks. All three stocks hail from the agricultural chemicals industry group, which ranks No. 8 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Further showcasing strength among companies in the chemicals industry, Nutrien, CF and Mosaic all sport the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). The stellar rating in [Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-your-stock-an-a-or-d-find-out-before-you-buy-with-stock-checkup/) means each company is outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


While the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) have sold off recently, they managed to rebound to close out the week. Meanwhile, the rising relative strength lines for Nutrien, CF and Mosaic show how chemicals have been counteracting and pushing back against the general [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) for some time now.

Nutrien Fertilizes Record 2021 Growth — Sees More In 2022
---------------------------------------------------------


Based in Canada, Nutrien is the world's largest provider of crop inputs and services, playing a critical role in helping agricultural growers increase food production in a sustainable manner. The company produces and distributes roughly 27 million tons of potash, nitrogen and phosphate products worldwide.


On Feb. 16, Nutrien posted [record results for Q4 2021](https://www.nutrien.com/investors/news-releases/2022-nutrien-delivers-record-results-and-expects-continued-growth-2022) and expects continued growth in 2022.


In Q4, Nutrien generated 929% earnings growth, bringing its average EPS gains over the last three quarters to 491%. For the first quarter of this year, analysts expect 803% growth, leading to 79% earnings growth for 2022.


Sales growth has accelerated over the last three quarters, rising from 11% to a 79% gain in Q4.


While Nutrien did not join fellow chemical leaders CF Industries and **FMC** ([FMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FMC)) on the list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-scoop-up-apple-nvidia-microsoft-as-new-market-uptrend-begins/), it has shown signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/). Nutrien sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.3 up/down volume ratio, and seven quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 32 funds with an A or better rating from IBD own shares in NTR stock.


Chemicals That Pay Dividends
----------------------------


Nutrien tops peers CF, FMC and Mosaic in terms of [dividend stocks](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/high-dividend-stocks/) in the agricultural chemicals group.  Nutrien pays a dividend yielding 2.4% on an annualized basis, topping that of FMC (1.8%), CF (1.5%) and Mosaic (0.9%).


In announcing last year's results, Nutrien noted that it prioritized the use of cash in 2021 to strengthen and reposition its balance sheet, reducing long-term debt by $2.1 billion. The company deployed $2.1 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2021.


Nutrien Cultivates Buy Point
----------------------------


Despite the political, economic, and market turmoil noted earlier, Nutrien has retaken the 77.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) it initially cleared on Feb. 10. On an intraday basis, the stock briefly fell more than 8% below that entry on Feb. 15 but reversed higher to close the day at the top of the price range and above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). After a strong upside reversal in good volume Thursday, Nutrien is now trading at the top of its buy zone.


While Nutrien has moved in and out of buy range in recent days, compare that with the sharp sell-off in the major indexes in recent weeks. Nutrien's strong RS line further confirms how the stock has shown market-leading resilience and strength.


Fellow chemical leaders CF Industries and Mosaic have also managed to buck selling pressure in the general market.

The biggest banks like **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) may generate the most headlines, but **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) outranks them in Forbes' latest list of the '[Best Banks In America](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/01/10/full-list-ranking-americas-100-largest-banks/#1e27765c3822).'
Western Alliance moved up from No. 10 in 2016 to No. 4 in this year's ranking, which looked at 10 metrics to measure growth, credit quality and profitability.


At No. 57, JPMorgan ranked highest among the country's four largest banks, followed by Wells Fargo (63), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) (72) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) (97).


Western Alliance's fellow [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) members **Home Bancshares** ([HOMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOMB)), **Bank Of The Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) and **Sterling Bancorp** ([STL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STL)) also made Forbes' list, coming in at No. 8, No. 11 and No. 36, respectively.


Western Alliance's 99 Composite Rating and also earn it a spot on [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), IBD's most screen for stocks to watch.


No. 1 Stock In No. 2-Ranked Industry
------------------------------------


Boosted by a 46.6% annual pretax profit margin and 26% three-year annual growth rate for both sales and earnings, Wester Alliance ties **Guaranty Bancorp** ([GBNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBNK)) for the top spot in the No. 2-ranked Banks — West/Southwest industry group.


The Phoenix-based regional bank has over $17 billion in assets with operations in Nevada, Arizona and California.


Western Alliance reported Q4 numbers on Jan. 27, posting 23% growth for both revenue and earnings.


Analysts expect a 15% rise in earnings this year, followed by a 14% increase in 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Trump Bump Or Trump Slump?
--------------------------


Like many financial stocks, Western Alliance shot higher following Donald Trump's election in November, then began forming a [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) to consolidate those gains.



Western Digital is now within striking distance of a 50.82 buy point in a second-stage flat base. An A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio point to institutional demand for the stock.


Western Digital slipped lower Tuesday, but stayed above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages. Its Relative Strength line is still floating near new high ground.


But after lifting the stock market with his surprise win, President Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees from certain countries has rattled the indexes, so keep a close watch for [any changes in market direction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/tracking-trends/) to see if investors' fears fade or the Trump bump turns into a Trump slump.

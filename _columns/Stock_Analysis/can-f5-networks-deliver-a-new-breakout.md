Seattle-based F5 Networks provides technology that optimizes delivery of cloud-based applications and improves the performance of network resources.

  

Analysts say that a new partnership with **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) has been a plus for **F5** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)).

  

Last month, the company announced that John McAdam, CEO since 2000, will retire in about a year.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of single-digit sales growth in 2013, revenue has come in between 18% and 20% over the past three reports.

  

Earnings have also picked up, including a 25% rise in Q3.

  

For fiscal 2015 (which ends next September), analysts expect earnings to rise 17%, followed by a 14% gain in fiscal 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

F5 sports a solid 28% return on equity and 97 Composite Rating. Its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate buying over the past 13 weeks, and the rise in fund ownership in recent quarters is another sign of institutional demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a huge move in 2009 and 2010, F5's stock went into a multiyear slump beginning in 2011.

  

As earnings rebounded this year, so did the stock, earning F5 a spot on the IBD 50.

  

Like most tech stocks, F5 sold off in early October on fears that the semiconductor industry was entering a down cycle.

  

But it quickly reclaimed its 40-week and 10-week moving averages as the stock built the right side of its cup-shaped base. Heavy-volume up weeks within the pattern are a positive sign of institutional accumulation.

  

As of Friday's close, F5 was trading about 1% below its 128.40 potential buy point.

Focusing on [cheap stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/research/cheap-stocks-to-buy/) often adds undue risk. As the saying goes, cheap stocks are cheap for a reason. But that doesn't mean investors can't find lower-priced gems worth a look. One such potential winner is exchange-traded products firm **Wisdom Tree** ([WT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WT)).


So as Wall Street digests this week's [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q3-2025-earnings/) from megacap **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which just got a [rare downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-earnings-downgrade-whisper-numbers/), here are three reasons — including a fresh breakout — the ETF provider could prove a wise choice for your portfolio.




1. Wisdom Tree Breaks Out — With This Positive Twist
----------------------------------------------------


[The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/) focuses on stocks priced above $10 a share. With a current price of right around $12, Wisdom Tree just meets that requirement. Yet several factors elevate the company above other cheap stocks on the market.


Following a heavy-volume gap-up on Nov. 6, Wisdom Tree has just launched a fresh breakout, clearing an 11.72 entry in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). The positive twist for the ETF firm is that the new pattern is first-stage, which significantly reduces risk while improving the chances of a successful climb.


After poking its head into buy range on Wednesday, Wisdom Tree gapped up Thursday, lifting it further into the buy zone, where it ended the week. The stock is up over 15% this month.


It is a first-stage base because Wisdom Tree [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/) by undercutting the low in its prior pattern. As shown on a weekly chart, the stock did that when it retreated below the 9.31 low in its previous [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) in June and early July.


With the stock back above its 10-week moving average with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) on the rise, that reset could clear the decks for a sustained run for Wisdom Tree.


By contrast, [Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/) is in a fourth-stage base. Such late-stage patterns can work, but add an extra element of risk. The AI juggernaut spiked higher early Thursday, then quickly retreated before finding support at its 21-day line. Down over 3% on Friday, Nvidia is clinging to support at that benchmark.

2. Building On Big Growth
-------------------------


An impressive track record of growth and a positive outlook provide another potential catalyst for Wisdom Tree.


Over the last five quarters, Wisdom Tree has generated sales growth ranging from 18% to 25%. In its latest report on Oct. 25, the company posted $113.2 million in revenue. For Q4, analysts expect a 24% year-over-year gain to $112.7 million.


[Wisdom Tree](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-wisdomtree-wt.aspx) has also delivered strong bottom-line gains. Over the last five quarters, it has posted earnings growth ranging from 67% to 175%. Showing why it remains among the top cheap stocks to watch, Wisdom Tree grew earnings 80% to 18 cents per share last quarter. For the full year, consensus analyst estimates call for a 76% gain to 65 cents a share.


3. Clear Demand For Wisdom Tree Stock
-------------------------------------


A third factor making Wisdom Tree one of the best cheap stocks to watch is solid institutional demand.


In addition to a 1.5 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/), Wisdom Tree sports six quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 25 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD have a position in Wisdom Tree stock.


All these factors contribute to Wisdom Tree earning the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-wisdomtree-wt.aspx). That actually tops the [97 score for Nvidia](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.aspx).

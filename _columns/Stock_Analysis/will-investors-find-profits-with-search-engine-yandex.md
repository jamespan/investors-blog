**Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) is sometimes called the "Google of Russia" and is that country's top search engine with more than 60% of that market. **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)), which is its closest competitor there, only has 26% of the Russian search market.

  

And 97% of Yandex's revenue comes from Russia, but it also serves other countries in the region.

  

And though it may not be a household name here in the States like Google is, a May 16 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/051513-656125-yandex-passes-microsoft-bing-in-queries.htm) noted that it surpassed Bing, which is run by Microsoft, to become the world's fourth-largest Internet search engine.

  

Analysts say that from Nov.-Dec. only two of the top five search engines had an increased number of user searches — Baidu and Yandex. Baidu is the world's second most-used search engine and Yahoo is No. 3.

  

One of the things Yandex has is geographic-centered home pages in Russia that target its different regions and cultures. It also aggregates news and offers price shopping, customer reviews, traffic reports, TV schedules and other online services.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• And that's helped bolster the bottom line. It's scored a long string of solid earnings growth increases in recent years, with earnings up 53% last quarter.

  

• Sales growth, however, has cooled somewhat though it still came in at a respectable 29%.

  

• Going forward, analysts see earnings climbing 32% this year and 26% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-yandex-n-v-class-a-yndx.aspx) shows Yandex scores a 99 Composite Rating, the highest possible. That ties it with three other stocks - **BitAuto Holdings** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **SuFun** ([SFUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFUN)) for highest rating in the group. Rival Google has a 98 Composite Rating.

  

And the industry group itself is ranked No. 11 among IBD's 197 groups. So it's been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Yandex came public on the Nasdaq in 2011 and recently broke out of this cup-shaped base.

  

Volume was weak on May 3, the day it broke out. But volume picked just a few days later as the stock climbed higher.

  

It's now too far extended past its ideal buy point to get into safely. But it's a young stock and has some nice fundamentals, so it may be worth a spot on your watch list.

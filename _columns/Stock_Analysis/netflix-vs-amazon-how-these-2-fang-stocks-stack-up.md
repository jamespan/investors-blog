With Cyber Monday results waiting to come in and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) testing a 1,200 share price, Wall Street is buzzing about CEO Jeff Bezos and his ever-expanding empire. Meanwhile, fellow [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) may be getting ready to stream past a new buy point.









 
 
 With its hands in a much wider range of industries, from retail and cloud services to grocery markets and [potentially the pharmacy business](https://www.investors.com/news/300-billion-amazon-pharmacy-industry-rumor-continues/), Amazon's annual revenue dwarfs that of Netflix. Team Bezos generated $136 billion in sales in 2016, compared to $8.8 billion for Netflix. The latter is on pace to easily clear $10 billion this year.
Over the last three quarters, Netflix has dramatically outpaced its online streaming rival with average EPS growth of 258%, compared with an average decline of 13% for Amazon.


Netflix has a slight edge in terms of annual sales growth over the last three years, with its 28% rate outpacing Amazon's 24%. But keep in mind that Amazon is working off a much larger revenue base.


Overall, Netflix earns a 91 Composite Rating and the No. 1 ranking in the Leisure-Movies & Related industry group. Amazon gets a score of 80, up from 75 on Monday, and comes in at No. 10 within the Retail-Internet group. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) holds the top spot among the online retailers.


Netflix Streaming Vs. Amazon Prime
----------------------------------


Both companies have aggressively expanded their streaming services internationally, with Netflix now boasting 104 million members in over 190 countries.


While Amazon doesn't release the official head count, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that there are 85 million Amazon Prime members. The Amazon Prime streaming service is available in over 200 countries.


To differentiate their services and develop more exclusive movies and shows, both companies are spending billions on original content like "Stranger Things" for Netflix and "Transparent" for Amazon.


In its third-quarter report, Netflix said it will spend $6 billion next year developing content, while [Amazon is expected to spend $4.5 billion](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-vs-amazon-prime-video-content-spend-estimate-chart-2017-4), according to **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is also getting into the game. The Wall Street Journal reported in August that the iPhone maker intends to [spend $1 billion over the next year on original content](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-readies-1-billion-war-chest-for-hollywood-programming-1502874004).


Breakout Ahead?
---------------


Amazon broke out on Oct. 27 after reporting Q3 earnings the day before. The stock is now around 11% above the 1,083.41 buy point and trading right around the 1,200 mark. Note that Amazon's base is a later-stage pattern.


Netflix also broke out in October, but has now pulled back to form a new consolidation â€” a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base.



On Tuesday, Netflix support at its 10-day moving average and rose over 2% in above-average volume, putting it just 3% below the 204.48 entry. Look for the stock to push through the buy point in trade at least 40% higher than normal. Also see if the relative strength line can move into new high ground at the same time.


Amazon poked its head above 1,200 on both Monday and Tuesday, but has failed to close above that benchmark. The stock closed Tuesday's session down fractionally at 1,193.60.

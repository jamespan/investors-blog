Whatever the decade, top-performing stocks like **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) or **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) display the [seven telltale signs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) of winning stocks. Streaming pioneer **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is no different.




[Three of the core CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investing-in-stocks-see-how-to-buy-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) are [big earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/), strong [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) and [something new](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/) that's driving demand. Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia and Walmart had — and still have — these ingredients that propel stocks to huge runs.


As a result of their leading fundamental and technical performance, NFLX stock, AMZN and NVDA all sport the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The rating means that each stock is outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/).


To zero in on stocks showing these signs of outperformance, regularly check [IBD stock lists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sp500-beating-lists-find-next-apple-amazon/), which highlight companies displaying these traits right now.

The Best Mutual Funds Binge On Netflix Stock
--------------------------------------------


The coronavirus pandemic is clearly driving demand for online shopping, video streaming and tech stocks in general. As a result, Netflix, Amazon, Walmart, Nvidia and Apple are all now trading around their all-time highs.


The [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buying-tech-stocks-including-amazon-zoom-nvidia-microsoft-alibaba-facebook/) have taken notice. In the latest report, 33 top money managers invested roughly $148.1 million in NFLX stock. Plus, 460 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have also reported a position in the [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/).


Three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth — averaging 201% — is just one factor driving demand among large investors. In Q2, [Netflix smashed subscriber targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-earnings-q2-2020-nflx-stock/) but missed profit estimates. Analysts see EPS growing 50% for the current year.


Netflix has also grown revenue at an annual pace of 30% over the last three years. The video streaming pioneer expects to add [2.5 million new subscribers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-earnings-q2-2020-nflx-stock/) in the current quarter.


NFLX stock joins several other top tech stocks on the upcoming list of new buys by the best mutual funds. Amazon, Nvidia, Apple and fellow FANG stocks **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) also made the cut.


While Amazon and Nvidia have earned a spot on various IBD stock lists, only Netflix is featured on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).


NFLX Stock Tests Support And Resistance Near All-Time High
----------------------------------------------------------


As the remarkable tech rally by the Nasdaq encounters resistance, Netflix has retreated but had a solid close in the final hours of trading Friday. It ended the week 10% below a 575.47 buy point, coming well off its lows and finding support at its 50-day moving average, a [key line of support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


Be sure to check the weekly and even monthly charts to get longer-term insight into how Netflix is weathering recent volatility as it tries to keep its climb intact.

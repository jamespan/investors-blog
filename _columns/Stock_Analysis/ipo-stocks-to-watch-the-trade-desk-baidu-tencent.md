**Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), which provides an online marketplace for advertisers to buy media, already has a track record of strong earnings and sales growth. Now it's tapping into the Chinese market through new partnerships with **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and leading Chinese video-streaming companies **iQiyi** ([IQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IQ)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA))-owned Youku.




Announced last month, these partnerships with [China's premiere media companies](https://www.thetradedesk.com/press-releases/the-trade-desk-connects-global-brands-to-millions-of-consumers-in-china-through-integrations-with-leading-media-companies) enable clients of Trade Desk to market directly to Chinese consumers.


"Tapping into the growing internet-connected middle class in China presents a huge opportunity for brands looking to grow their global presence," said CEO Jeff Green.

Trade Desk Among Top IPO Stocks To Watch
----------------------------------------


Trade Desk's cloud-based platform allows ad buyers to create, manage and optimize their online marketing campaigns. Using what the company calls the "most expressive bid capabilities" on the market, advertisers can buy and build campaigns across multiple devices and ad formats, including display, video, audio and social media.


It's proven to be a highly profitable, fast-growing model. Over the last three years, Trade Desk has posted average annual earnings growth of 63%. During the same period, annual average sales growth has grown at a 64% clip. In Q3, the Ventura, Calif.-based company posted an 86% spike in earnings and 50% revenue growth.


Trade Desk made the most recent list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/). **QuinStreet** ([QNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QNST)), which shares the No. 1-ranking in the advertising services group with Trade Desk, also made the list. It sports a three-year earnings growth rate of 357%.


The industry group ranks No. 21 out of 197, meaning both companies qualify as [top-ranked stocks in highly rated industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3853550).


Consensus analyst estimates for Trade Desk's EPS growth for this year (51%) and 2019 (15%) were both recently revised higher.


In addition to receiving the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Trade Desk has also earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). The company went public in September 2016, while its new Chinese partner iQiyi had its IPO in March of this year.


While Trade Desk didn't make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-large-cap-stocks-warren-buffett-berkshire-starbucks-adobe-cvs/), institutional investors have taken note. The stock has seen two quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 86 funds with an A+ rating own shares.


IPO Stocks To Watch: Breakout Ahead?
------------------------------------


Trade Desk has formed handle to offer a 149.10 buy point. In a bullish sign of market leadership, the relative strength line is already at a new 52-week high.


The stock soared over 37% on Aug. 10 on Q3 earnings. It continued higher from there until the end of September, as the general market also pulled back.


The stock spent much of its current base below the 50-day moving average, but retook that benchmark line on Nov. 26. As it worked on its handle Wednesday, Trade Desk gapped up to a 4% gain, but in below-average volume. On Thursday, the stock fell 3%, but in light volume.


On Friday, Trade Desk was down 1.8%, but still managed a 2.2% gain for the week, leaving it 8% below the buy point.


As always, keep a close eye on the general market. Given that action and the ongoing market volatility, it's best to be very cautious about making any new buys.

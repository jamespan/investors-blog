Today we're going to look at **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)), which makes vision systems that serve as the eyes for robotic machines

  

The firm's software and sensors help detect flaws, monitor production lines and guide assembly robots

  

It's also a leader in industrial ID readers.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth was bumpy a few years ago, but seems to be improving. Growth ranged from 20% to 52% the past three quarters.

  

Sales growth has also picked up, coming in at 26% last quarter.

  

Going forward, analysts see earnings rising 47% this year but falling 2% next year.

  

Mutual funds own about 62% of the company's shares. And you'll also notice the number of funds with stakes in Cognex has been climbing in recent quarters â€” so there is some interest from big investors.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

If we run Cognex through [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-cognex-corp-cgnx.aspx), we see it carries a 94 Composite Rating, the best among the 29 stocks in its Electronic-Scientific/Measuring industry group.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 74 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows Cognex is forming this second-stage flat base.

  

Normally the ideal buy point in a flat base is the highest point in the pattern.

  

But Cognex has repeatedly run into resistance.

  

So that resistance area gives us a lower buy point that we can find by adding 10 cents to the peak in that ceiling, which makes the ideal buy point 44.35.

  

Watch to see if Cognex can jump past that potential buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average.

  

But remember, with the market uptrend under pressure, you should be careful in selecting any new buys.

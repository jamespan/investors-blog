After a long stretch of hitting resistance multiple times just below the 100 mark, **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) looks to energize a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-using-flat-base-chart-pattern/). With estimates saying its earnings are set to jump this year, MNST stock is trading just below a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).




Showcased as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mnst-stock-tinkers-with-early-entry-analysts-see-strong-earnings/) on Jan. 17, Monster continues to flash positive [technical action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) in its [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/).


Earlier this month, MNST stock found support and retook its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Now the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) is bubbling back above the longer-term 50-day benchmark — a sign of rebounding technical strength.


Monster Beverage hails from the nonalcoholic beverages group, which ranks No. 53 among the [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


With a 89 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Monster ranks third among its peers in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-monster-beverage-mnst.aspx). Three Coca-Cola-related firms — **Coca-Cola Ferma** ([KOF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KOF)), **Coca-Cola Europacific Partners** ([CCEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCEP)) and  **Coca-Cola Consolidated** ([COKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COKE)) — join MNST stock among the group leaders.


Back in 2014, the mother ship Coke entity, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), agreed to pay Monster $2.15 billion in cash for a 17% stake in the company. The deal had Coke transfer its energy-drink division to Monster, while Monster agreed to transfer its nonenergy drinks to Coke.


Wall Street Eyes EPS Pop For Monster Beverage This Year
-------------------------------------------------------


Based in Corona, Calif., Monster Beverage battles privately held rival Red Bull for energy drink dominance. Monster's brands include Monster Energy, Reign, NOS Energy, Full Throttle, Predator Energy and more.


Last January, the company decided to take more than a sip of the alcohol business, announcing it would [acquire CANarchy Craft Brewery for $330 million](https://investors.monsterbevcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/monster-beverage-corporation-acquire-canarchy-craft-brewery). The transaction adds a slew of brands to the Monster Beverage portfolio, including Jai Alai IPA, Florida Man IPA, Dale's Pale Ale and more.


This month, Monster is on tap to roll out the first flavored malt beverage under its namesake brand, called The Beast Unleashed.


While sales growth for Monster Beverage has ranged from 13% to 22% over the last three quarters, earnings growth has struggled. But a turnaround may be in the works.


After reporting a 5% year-over-year decline to 60 cents per share in Q3, analysts expect a 5% increase when Monster reports Q4 numbers on March 1.


Although that would cap a 10% slowdown in earnings for 2022, consensus estimates call for a jump to 32% EPS growth in 2023.


MNST Stock Takes Swipe At Buy Point
-----------------------------------


With Q4 earnings on tap and strong estimates for 2023, Monster Beverage continues to work on its flat base showing a 104.75 entry. A breakout would push the stock more decisively beyond the long-term area of resistance noted earlier.


In a sign of solid institutional demand, MNST stock sports a 1.6 up/down volume ratio. Anything above 1.0 points to demand. Plus, 55 funds with an "A+" rating from IBD own shares in the stock.


With the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) back in an uptrend, look for Monster Beverage to pop into its [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) in [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) at least 40% above average.

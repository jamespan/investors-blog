**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), America's largest beauty retailer, is now accepting applications for its inaugural program dedicated to supporting early-stage BIPOC beauty brands. Meanwhile, Ulta stock has fashioned a fresh buy point.




Top money managers like what they see from the seller of cosmetics, fragrance, skin care and hair care products, as well as salon services. Ulta made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shun-tech-stocks-scoop-up-medical-defense-oil-stocks/). The Illinois-based retailer with over 1,300 stores nationwide also made the monthly update to this [stock screen](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/) back in May.


With a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Ulta Beauty earns top billing within the specialty retailers industry. Peer **Sally Beauty Holdings** ([SBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBH)) has been on a downward trajectory, slipping to a 40 Composite Rating. Rival beauty retailer Sephora is owned by LVMH, which is also home to brands such as Christian Dior and TAG Heuer. LVMH trades on the [Euronext Paris Eurolist](https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/paris).


Ulta Finds Its MUSE In Early-Stage BIPOC Brands
-----------------------------------------------


Starting this week, Ulta is now accepting applications for its [MUSE Accelerator](https://www.ulta.com/investor/news-events/press-releases/detail/153/ulta-beauty-launches-muse-accelerator-program-focused-on). This inaugural program focuses on supporting early-stage BIPOC beauty brands to launch and thrive in retail.


Standing for Black, Indigenous, and people of color, Ulta's BIPOC initiative aims to support a diverse group of entrepreneurs "so all guests can see themselves reflected at Ulta Beauty," said Monica Arnaudo, the company's chief merchandising officer.


Set for a September launch, eight BIPOC beauty brand applicants will receive $50,000 to propel brand development. To prepare each participant for long-term success, the MUSE Accelerator will provide expertise on retail-related subjects such as merchandising, supply chain, legal and marketing.


With Masks Off And Makeup Back On, Ulta Tops Estimates
------------------------------------------------------


During the pandemic, with people wearing masks and less makeup, Ulta and other beauty retailers took a hit. Shares in Ulta fell as low as 124 in March 2020. But the company and its stock bounced back with strong reports in recent fiscal quarters.


On May 26, [Ulta beat on earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-stock-attempts-makeover-ulta-earnings/) and raised its outlook. For the fiscal quarter (ended April 30), Ulta delivered double-digit comparable sales growth across all major categories.


Showing the health of the company, Ulta sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), boosted by a 15% annual pretax profit margin, 55% return on equity and 0% debt-to-equity ratio.


Ulta Stock Gets Ready For Its Close-Up And New Buy Point
--------------------------------------------------------


As the May 26 date approached, Ulta stock was getting ready for the spotlight. It rose over 2% in above-average and rising volume on May 25. The next day, Ulta gapped up to more than a 7% gain in volume 163% higher than normal.


After the report, Ulta Beauty gapped up again, soaring over 12%. Volume bolted 260% above average.


After such big moves, it's normal for a stock to ease back and digest its gains. Ulta has pulled back to form a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), creating a 426.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock briefly traded above that level earlier this week but has now pulled back within the handle as the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) come under pressure.


In what bodes well for the stock after its nice run off the 2020 pandemic lows, Ulta's current [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) is a first-stage base. Like a type of reset button, last month Ulta [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in its prior pattern.


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already hitting a new high, look for Ulta Beauty to decisively clear the 426.93 entry in volume at least 40% above average.

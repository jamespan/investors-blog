As fellow club retailer **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) soars to [new highs](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/), **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) goes shopping for a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) of its own. After a new partnership with **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), BJ's stock is now looking to clear a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




Categorized in different industry groups in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), BJ's Wholesale and Costco both earn top billing among their peers.

BJ's Wholesale Teams Up With DoorDash
-------------------------------------


Based in Westborough, Mass., BJ's Wholesale Club operates membership warehouse clubs in the eastern U.S. Retail outlets include 226 clubs and 158 BJ's Gas locations in 17 states.


Last month, BJ's Wholesale Club made two moves aimed at further streamlining fast delivery for customers.


At the end of March, BJ's announced the chainwide rollout of [Same-Day Select](https://investors.bjs.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2022/BJs-Wholesale-Club-Launches-Same-Day-Select-Expanding-Same-Day-Delivery-Offering-for-Members/default.aspx), a membership add-on to its popular Same-Day Delivery service, an upgrade option for BJ's Wholesale members. The offering allows customers to pay a one-time fee upfront for either unlimited or a set number of same-day grocery deliveries in as little as two hours. Annual costs for these delivery options range from $55 to $100.


Also in March, [BJ's partnered with DoorDash](https://investors.bjs.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2022/BJs-Wholesale-Club-Partners-with-DoorDash-to-Provide-Members-and-Non-Members-Convenient-Access-to-BJs-Products-On-Demand/default.aspx) to give club members and nonmembers access to BJ's products on demand.


BJ's is the first wholesale club available on the DoorDash marketplace, providing consumers with access to home essentials and grocery needs on demand. The discount retailer's products can be purchased directly on the DoorDash app.


BJ's Wholesale Vs. Costco
-------------------------


[Costco was featured on March 28](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/costco-enters-buy-zone-as-it-outpaces-target-walmart-and-top-funds-bet-on-cost-stock/) while trading in its most recent [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). [BJ's Wholesale was featured in this column on Aug. 21, 2018,](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/best-ipo-stocks-to-watch-bjs-wholesale-club-costco-walmart/) following a return to the public markets with an [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) after being taken private in 2011.


In terms of market cap and revenue, Costco dwarfs BJ's Wholesale.


For each of the last three quarters, BJ's Wholesale has delivered over $4 billion in sales, while Costco has generated over $50 billion in each of its last two fiscal quarters.


Costco has a market capitalization of $255 billion, compared with BJ's market cap of $9.3 billion. Both companies have seen their market caps shaved somewhat as the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) come under pressure.


While vastly different in size and scale, BJ's stock offers a potentially more actionable opportunity for investors.


BJ's Stock Sets Up After Costco Breaks Out
------------------------------------------


After breaking out in March, Costco remains slightly extended but has run into resistance around the 600 mark for its share price.


Looking to follow its larger retail rival, BJ's Wholesale is working on a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) showing a 71.10 entry. While technically in a [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), BJ's stock has re-energized after taking a breather from a 27% decline in its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


In a sign of market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has hit a new high ahead of BJ's stock's potential breakout. But the stock felt the pressure Friday as the market sold off.


While already well above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), BJ's Wholesale made a nice bounce off its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) within the [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) earlier in the week. But it slipped below that benchmark on Friday.


Also note that both BJ's Wholesale and Costco have earnings reports scheduled for late May.

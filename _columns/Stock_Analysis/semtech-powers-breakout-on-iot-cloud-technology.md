As cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) continue to drive anywhere, anytime access for mobile apps and data, **Semtech** ([SMTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMTC)) rides those trends. And SMTC stock is now powering a fresh breakout.




One key to the semiconduct provider's IoT and cloud innovations is it [LoRa](https://investors.semtech.com/websites/semtechcorp/English/2120/us-press-release.html?airportNewsID=4fa59cf5-dfa6-48a1-9e6a-e777e3c45081) and [LoRanWAN](https://www.semtech.com/lora/lorawan-standard) platforms. LoRa — short for long range — is the de facto wireless platform for IoT. It enables smart IoT applications that help address major challenges, such as energy management, pollution control and infrastructure efficiency.


LoRaWAN is a low power, wide area networking (LPWAN) standard managed by the LoRa Alliance, an nonprofit technology alliance. The platform is designed to wirelessly connect battery operated devices in regional, national or global networks.


As part of its global IoT and cloud computing push, on Sept. 9 Semtech announced a [collaboration with Cloud Energy](https://investors.semtech.com/websites/semtechcorp/English/2120/us-press-release.html?airportNewsID=4fa59cf5-dfa6-48a1-9e6a-e777e3c45081), a leading IoT solutions provider in Vietnam. The two companies will develop a network running on LoRaWAN for a wireless solar power system installed on facility rooftops. Semtech noted that a wired energy solution did not fit a rooftop solar power system due to higher hardware, installation and maintenance costs.

SMTC Stock Connects With New Buy Point
--------------------------------------


Semtech has just cleared a 79.54 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Volume on Wednesday's breakout was above average, as it was for Thursday's additional 1.4% price gain. The stock eased back Friday but ended the week with nearly a 4% gain.


In a sign that SMTC stock is outperforming the S&P 500, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has risen sharply higher over the last month.


SMTC stock is still within the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), which extends up to 5% above the entry.


While forming its latest [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), SMTC stock fell below a declining [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). But the IoT leader reclaimed that benchmark before the breakout. Plus, the 10-week line has begun trending in the right direction and is on the verge of getting back above the long-term 40-week line.

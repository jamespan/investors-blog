While the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group ranks a lowly No. 110, industry leaders **Duluth** ([DLTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTH)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) have all posted breakouts in recent weeks.


Is **Children's Place** ([PLCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLCE)) next in line?


Investors will likely get the answer on Wednesday, when the New Jersey-based operator of over 1,000 stores [reports Q2 earnings before the market open](https://www.investors.com/news/american-eagle-childrens-place-earnings-reports-stocks-near-highs/). (On Tuesday, [TJX fell sharply on disappointing guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/why-tjx-shares-are-falling-early-despite-a-q2-beat-and-raise/) for Q3 and the full year. Rival discounter Ross also fell.)


After a rocky couple of years, Children's Place has seen a rebound in profitability, with three straight quarters of rising EPS growth, including a 59% gain in Q1.


Sales growth remains tepid, but has edged higher, coming in at 4% in each of the last two reports. That followed three consecutive quarters of negative revenue growth.


Institutional demand for Children's Place has also been on the rise, as indicated by a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771), 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Earnings Pop Or Drop?
---------------------


Children's Place tried to clear an 85.01 entry in a second-stage [cup-shaped base](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787) on July 26, before immediately pulling back in the days that followed.


 But the stock found stock found support at the 50-day line, and is now back within striking distance of the buy point after getting a boost from two heavy-volume up days on Aug. 11 and 15.
On Tuesday, Children's Place ignored weakness in discount retailers like TJX, **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)),  managing to break out in volume 183% above average. All eyes now turn to Wednesday's earnings report.

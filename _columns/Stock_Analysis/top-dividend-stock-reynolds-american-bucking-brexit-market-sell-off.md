Most stocks head south in market sell-offs like the current one triggered by last week's Brexit vote. But here's one name that may avoid going up in smoke: tobacco giant **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)).


With Britain's decision to leave the European Union rattling global markets, fund managers and other institutional investors are looking for defensive stocks to help them weather the storm.


Cigarette companies such as Reynolds, **Altria** ([MO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MO)) and **Phillip Morris International** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) may fit that bill for two reasons: Each company pays a relatively strong dividend, and even in a weak economy, smokers are going to smoke.


Reynolds American's 94 Composite Rating earns the No. 1 ranking among its peers in the tobacco industry, ahead of Altria, **British American Tobacco** ([BTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTI)), Phillip Morris and **Universal** ([UVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVV)).


In terms of dividends, however, Reynolds' current 3.2% yield is below that of Phillip Morris (4.2%), British American Tobacco (3.8%) and Altria (3.3%).


But as the table below shows, Reynolds American's sales and earnings growth and its pretax profit margin are outpacing each of its rivals, partly due to last year's addition of the Newport brand of cigarettes through its $27.4 billion acquisition of Lorillard.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Company** | **3-Year Annual Sales Growth** | **3-Year Annual EPS Growth** | **Annual Pretax Profit Margin** |
| Reynolds American | 42% | 10% | 36.2% |
| Altria | 2% | 9% | 33.2% |
| British American Tobacco | -6% | 0% | N/A |
| Phillip Morris | -2% | 0% | 15.5% |
| Universal | -5% | -4% | 8.5% |


Can Reynolds Light Up New Breakout?
-----------------------------------


Reynolds American has a long track record of relatively tight trading with good support along its 10-week moving average.


The stock has moved steadily higher as it continues to work on a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) that stretches all the way back to 2013, with multiple consolidations along the way.


Its current pattern within that long-term formation is a flat base with a 52.64 buy point.


Despite the recent Brexit sell-off, Reynolds has held its ground, with its Relative Price Strength line trending higher.


While it's risky to buy any stock when selling pressure mounts in the general market, Reynolds American's recent chart action shows that, at least so far, it's faring better than most and may have the legs to keep climbing.

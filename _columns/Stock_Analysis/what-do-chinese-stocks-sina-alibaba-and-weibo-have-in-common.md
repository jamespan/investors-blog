Three top [Chinese internet stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) – **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) – have several things in common besides their home country, starting with ownership.









 
 
  Sina, one of China's largest online portals, spun off Weibo ahead of its 2014 IPO and still maintains a controlling interest in the so-called Twitter of China.
E-commerce giant Alibaba also owns nearly one-third of Weibo's shares.


Sina and Weibo also currently share another common trait: Both stocks are near potential buy zones ahead of their earnings reports on Aug. 9.


Alibaba has not set a date for its next quarterly report, but it's expected around the same time.


Will Q2 Earnings Drive New Climbs?
----------------------------------


Sina cleared a 95.59 buy point in a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at the end of last month, but has seesawed in and out of buy range since then. Volume has been lighter than you like to see on a breakout attempt.



On Wednesday, Sina fell back below the entry, but rebounded from the day's lows and found support at its 10-day moving average. Its relative strength line remains within striking distance of new high ground.


Weibo is working on a third-stage cup with an 82.38 entry. Such later-stage patterns entail more risk, but the stock has been finding support at both its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and 10-day moving averages, and the shorter term 10-day line has recently climbed back above its longer term cousin.


Strong Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------


Sina, Alibaba and Weibo all have been generating solid top- and bottom-line growth.


Over the last three quarters, Sina has averaged 491% earnings growth, followed by Weibo (179%) and Alibaba (35%).


In terms of annual sales growth over the last three years, Weibo leads with 43%, while Alibaba comes in at 21% — a solid number given its much larger revenue base. Sina has been growing revenue at a 15% annual clip, but posted a 40% gain in Q1.


Analysts expect triple-digit EPS gains from both Sina (111%) and Weibo (125%) in Q2 and a 26% rise from Alibaba.


Mixed Institutional Demand
--------------------------


Among the three stocks, only Alibaba made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/research/which-chinese-stocks-are-top-fund-managers-buying-alibaba-netease-autohome-yy/), which also included **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **New Oriental Education & Technologies** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)).


Sina has posted five consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership, but its D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate selling by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


The number of funds taking a position in Weibo has increased for eight quarters, but its D Accumulation/Distribution Rating also needs improvement. At a middling C, Alibaba has the best Accumulation/Distribution Rating among the three stocks and has posted seven quarters of rising fund ownership.


While it's risky to buy any stock just ahead of earnings, see if Sina and Weibo post strong numbers next week and clear their respective buy points in heavy volume.


On Thursday, Sina was up over 2%, pushing it back into the 95.59 - 100.37 buy range. But volume was well below average.


Trading was light for Weibo as well as it closed nearly 3% higher and about 2% below the buy point.


Alibaba showed resilience by recouping its morning losses to end the session over 1% higher.

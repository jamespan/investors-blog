Whether President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans repeal ObamaCare or not, health care providers will still need to improve efficiency and ensure accurate billing and payments. That's where **Cotiviti** ([COTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COTV)) comes in.


Proven to be one of the [best-performing IPO stocks of 2016](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), Cotiviti is a leading payment accuracy provider that works with eight of the top 10 U.S. health care payers and eight of the top 10 U.S. retailers.


The Atlanta-based company say it helps Medicare Advantage, private insurers, Medicaid Managed Care organizations and other clients capture over $3 billion annually through improved accuracy in handling claims and compliance.


Healthy, But Slowing Profits?
-----------------------------


After four straight quarters of triple-digit earnings gains, Cotiviti's growth has slowed to a more modest, but still respectable range of 24% to 31% over the last three reports.


Sales growth slowed from 19% to 14% in Q3.


When announcing third-quarter results on Nov. 9, Cotiviti raised its guidance for 2016.


The company now expects $615 million to $620 million in total revenue, up from $610 million to $615 million. It also raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast from $233 million to $235 million to $235 million to $237 million.


Consensus analyst estimates for 2016 were also recently revised higher to 61%.


While the Commercial Services-Health Care group ranks a lowly No. 124, Cotiviti holds the No. 2 spot, right behind **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)), a 2014 IPO that manages Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and has also made a nice run this year.


New Base After Big Post-IPO Run
-------------------------------


Just weeks after its market debut in May, Cotiviti cleared a 20.10 entry in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/), rising more than 80% until peaking in November.



During that run, the stock flashed a bearish reversal on Aug. 22, slicing through its 10-day moving average as it fell 9% in volume 402% above average.


When a highflying IPO breeches its 10-day line in volume like that, it can be viewed as a signal to lock in at least some of your gains.


Cotiviti entered a period of seesaw trading, eventually forming and breaking out of a flat base in early November. But the stock immediately reversed on Nov. 10, falling sharply below the 35.64 buy point.


While that breakout failed, Cotiviti has now formed another base — a first-stage pattern since the new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.


The Relative Strength line continues to float near new high ground, and two up weeks in above-average volume and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating point to accumulation within the base.


On Tuesday, Cotiviti closed a little over 3% below the 36.54 entry. See if the stock can clear the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal, but also keep in mind that newer IPOs can be volatile, as Cotiviti has shown recently.

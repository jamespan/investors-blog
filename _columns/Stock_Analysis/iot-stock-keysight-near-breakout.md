What do 78 of the Fortune 100 companies and 24 of the top 25 tech titans have in common? They're all customers of electronic measuring and Internet of Things (IoT) stock **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)).




Keysight traces its roots back to **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) founders Bill Hewett and Dave Packard and their early measurement devices.


After being spun off by HP in 1999, **Agilent Technologies** ([A](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=A)) announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, including the new Keysight Technologies. Keysight went public in November 2014.


Based in Santa Rosa, Calif., Keysight helps clients optimize and secure networks, as well as bring electronic products to market faster. Clients span a wide range of industries, including [aerospace and defense](https://www.investors.com/news/defense-and-aerospace-stocks-to-watch-and-industry-news/), [energy](http://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/), [semiconductors](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) and [automotive](https://www.investors.com/news/automotive-industry-news-self-driving-cars-and-stocks-to-watch/).


In June, Keysight announced the expansion of its handheld field measurement products with new Nemo IoT Meter and Nemo Handy IoT tools. These products enable network operators and service providers to actively test network performance for mission-critical and consumer-based IoT applications.


Last month, Keysight also announced it was extending its collaboration with MediaTek to accelerate 5G New Radio (NR) chipset development and the testing of 5G NR protocol stacks.

Rising Earnings Growth And Institutional Demand
-----------------------------------------------


For fiscal Q2 (ended April 30), Keysight posted a 30% spike in earnings, up from an 11% decline in Q1. Analysts expect a 29% rise in EPS in the third quarter. Revenue growth also accelerated in the second quarter, from 15% to 31%.


Keysight has seen two quarters of [rising fund ownership](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-new-buys-adobe-abiomed-macys-kohls/). A 1.6 up/down volume ratio and B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating also point to institutional demand.


The stock's modest 81 Composite Rating earns it the No. 4 spot within the scientific measuring industry group. **Vishay Precision** ([VPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VPG)), **Novanta** ([NOVT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOVT)), **IPGP Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) and **Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)) round out the top five leaders in the group.


Connecting Another IoT Stock Breakout?
--------------------------------------


On May 31, Keysight gapped up to a nearly 11% gain after reporting its latest earnings numbers. Volume spiked more than 1,000% above average. The move lifted Keysight past a 55.31 buy point.


Since then, the stock has been consolidating those gains and may now be setting up for a new breakout. It's working on a flat base as part of a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/). Note how the bottom of its current pattern formed right around the 10-week line and above the buy point in the prior pattern. Such behavior is a healthy sign of support and may mean the stock is forming steppingstones to keep climbing higher.


Keysight closed Thursday's session at 60.08, 4% below the 62.51 entry.

As an [IPO Analysis](http://news.investors.com/investing-ipo-analysis/030415-741962-rexford-industrial-zoes-forming-bases.htm) story noted this week, **Zoe's Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)) is part of a wave of restaurants that have had an IPO recently, including **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)), **Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) and **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)).

  

After debuting at 15 last April and closing at 24.72 on its first day of trading, Zoe's has taken investors on a bit of a roller coaster ride and is now approaching a potential new buy point.

  

The Texas-based company operates 138 fast-casual restaurants that offer "Mediterranean-inspired dishes delivered with Southern hospitality."

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Zoe's has posted 33% earnings growth in each of the last two quarters. Sales growth has been even more impressive, ranging from 36% and 59% over the last eight reports. The company is scheduled to report Q4 results on Mar. 11.

  

Zoe's has yet to deliver a profitable year, but it's expected to achieve that in 2015, with analysts looking for earnings to grow 500%.

  

One potential warning sign is the company's 178% debt-to-equity ratio, which could spell trouble if interest rates rise significantly.

  

Overall, Zoe's has an 89 Composite Rating, just below the 90 or higher score that is preferable. But it does have a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, and the number of funds with a position in the stock has been rising since it went public last year.

  

Another positive is the strength of the restaurants industry group, which currently ranks No. 4 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a bumpy ride since last April's IPO, Zoe's is hoping its third base will be the charm. Its current cup-with-handle is still considered an early-stage pattern since it's part of a longer, first-stage base-on-base formation.

  

Also note how the stock consistently found support at the 10-week line as it built the right side of the pattern. Several weeks of tight closes in the base, followed by a big pop in February, also showed healthy institutional support and accumulation.

  

The buy point is 35.75, 10 cents above the peak in the handle. On Tuesday and Wednesday, shares slipped below their short-term 10-day moving average during the trading session, but they found support and closed above it and near the top of the price range.

  

See if Zoe's Kitchen can break past the buy point on heavy volume, and keep an eye out for its Q4 earnings report.

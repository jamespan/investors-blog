Chipmaker **Allegro Microsystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) is testing a new breakout as it taps into and helps drive the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids. Having gone public in October 2020, the New Hampshire-based company has also earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) list of today's [top IPOs](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/).

Driving The EV And Hybrid Revolution
------------------------------------


Allegro Microsystems joins **Diodes** ([DIOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIOD)) and **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) in the [semiconductor](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) manufacturing industry group.


The industry ranks a strong No. 15 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. ALGM stock scores a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), meaning it is outperforming 93% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


The continued shift to hybrids and [EVs](https://www.investors.com/news/best-ev-stocks-buy-now-electric-cars/) helps drive [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/) for Allegro. In addition to three quarters of rising fund ownership, 50 top [mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-aapl-nvda-msft-googl-crm/) with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Allegro.


On Oct. 28, Allegro Microsystems reported a 122% rise in earnings growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, ended Sept. 24. For the current quarter, analysts expect 50% EPS growth and a 77% gain for the full fiscal year.


Allegro Microsystems Looks To Plug Into Fresh Breakout
------------------------------------------------------


After powering past an early 36.07 entry at the open, Allegro Microsystems has reversed and is now below that [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). As the enabler of EVs and hybrids tries to recharge, it also has eyes on a more traditional 36.95 entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has pulled off the highs it hit in September. Look for the RS line to rebound as Allegro stays above its [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


While the stock fell over 5% Thursday, it did manage to come off the day's lows and close above its 50-day line and right at its 21-day benchmark. On Friday, Allegro found support at its 50-day line.


Keep a close eye on trends in volume. After its stock jumped nearly 5% in volume 88% above average on Wednesday, Allegro fell in volume 78% above average on Thursday. The stock rose over 1% to end the week, but volume was below average.


See if volume on the upside picks up as Allegro Microsystems tries to gain traction and plug into a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

As the [stock market trend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/) turns positive but faces a test, **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) is on the starting block, set to launch a new breakout into an all-time high. It's also on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) watchlist, hoping to join **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and other top stocks to watch as full-fledged members on this premier screen.




Pool made a splash Thursday with news that it will replace **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)) on the [S&P 500](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3619179-pool-moves-to-s-and-p-500-cffnplus-9_6-agoplus-8_3-nrplus-3_4-on-index-moves). But as the stock market ran into resistance, Pool is also trading lower Friday.


While we did see a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Wednesday, investors should proceed with caution. Not all follow-though days lead to sustained new uptrends. Some will retreat and regroup before establishing an enduring upward move.


See how Pool, Alibaba, PayPal, ServiceNow and other leading stocks to watch perform as the new stock market rally tries to gain traction.

Pool, Alibaba, PayPal, ServiceNow Outpacing 99% Of All Stocks
-------------------------------------------------------------


To make the IBD Long-Term Leaders list, stocks must have a track record of stable earnings growth.


For the three-year Earnings Stability Rating, the lower the number the better. Pool (4), Alibaba (4), PayPal (2) and ServiceNow (7) all have solid ratings. Pool stock also joins Alibaba, PayPal and ServiceNow with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning each is outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Pool stock also joins Alibaba, PayPal and ServiceNow on IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buying-tech-stocks-including-amazon-zoom-nvidia-microsoft-alibaba-facebook/). (A new list comes out Friday.)


Pool Stock Swims To Head Of Leisure Industry
--------------------------------------------


Pool stock ties **Hibbett Sports** ([HIBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIBB)), **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) and **Sportsman's Warehouse** ([SPWH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWH)) for the No. 1 spot in the No. 8-ranked leisure products industry group.


Based in Covington, La., Pool is a global wholesale distributor of swimming pool equipment, parts and supplies, and related outdoor living products. With more than 4,500 employees, the company operates over 375 locations worldwide. Each of Pool's sales centers operate with full profit and loss responsibility, giving the organization an entrepreneurial spirit.


Over the last three years, Pool has generated average annual earnings growth of 22%. Analysts expect a 25% increase for 2020. The stock also sports a strong 75% return on equity.


Pool Stock May Splash Into New All-Time High
--------------------------------------------


Pool has retaken its 10-week moving average as it recovers from a short pullback in September. The stock is trying to clear a recent point of resistance, offering a potential entry at 342.25. Clearing that price point would mark a new all-time high for Pool.


Stock market history clearly shows that the best stocks to watch form bases during corrections, then break out and launch new runs when a new uptrend takes hold. While it is too soon to tell if Pool will trigger a new move from its current consolidation, it has been showing strength as a new nascent rally begins. It could offer a chance to gradually establish a new position or add to an existing one if Pool and the general market continue to rebound.


See how investors react to having Pool stock added to the S&P 500. Rather than get a bump, the stock has initially pulled back, but Pool found support at its 50-day line.

Boosted by a slew of acquisitions, a solid earnings beat and raised revenue guidance for the current quarter, **Extreme Networks** ([EXTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXTR)) has entered a new buy zone.









 
 
 Over the last year, the Silicon Valley-based firm has moved aggressively to beef up its ability to compete with larger networking rivals **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Hewlett-Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)).
Last September, Extreme Networks bought **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA))'s wireless LAN (WLAN) business, and in March of this year, the company announced it was purchasing the data center networking operations of **Brocade Communications Systems** ([BRCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCD)).


The latter deal came as Brocade was required to shed some assets before merging with **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).


Extreme Networks, which provides network infrastructure equipment for the education, health care and telecom industries, as well as government, across 80 countries, also announced in May that it had won the bid to buy Avaya's networking business out of bankruptcy.


112% EPS Growth, Raised Revenue Guidance
----------------------------------------


Extreme Networks beat analyst estimates with a 70% gain for fiscal 2017 Q4 (ended June 30), bringing its average EPS growth over the last three quarters to 112%.


Sales growth accelerated from 19% to 28%, and the company raised its revenue guidance for the current quarter.


Extreme Networks also sports a strong 52% return on equity.


As shown in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-extreme-networks-inc-extr.aspx), institutional demand for shares is reflected in the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership.


With a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Extreme Networks shares the top slot in the No. 18-ranked Computer-Networking industry group with **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)).


Connecting To New Buy Zone
--------------------------


The stock jumped over 11% on Aug. 15 after beating on earnings, with volume coming in 441% higher than normal.


Extreme Networks continued to edge higher from there, and on Monday, it managed to poke its head just above the 11.13 buy point in a cup without handle.


Volume was heavy and the relative strength line jumped into new high ground â€” a bullish sign of market leadership.


In early trade Wednesday, the stock was up around 2%, pushing it higher into the buy zone which extends to 11.69. Volume in recent days has been solidly above average.



Keep in mind that it's a third-stage pattern, and such later-stage bases entail more risk, since the stock has already made a big run by that point.


For example, Extreme Networks rose 182% from a first-stage breakout in July 2016 until it began forming its current third-stage base in June of this year.


But later-stage patterns can generate solid gains. Consider keeping such breakouts on a tighter leash, taking profits and cutting any losses sooner than you might do from an earlier stage move.

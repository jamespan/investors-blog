**Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) is the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), and it could be poised to make tasty gains as it flirts with a buy point.








The Chicago-based online and mobile food ordering company has carved out a niche by delivering meals from a wide variety of local restaurants.


Its ordering platforms allow diners to order from more than 80,000 takeout restaurants in over 1,600 cities in the U.S., while the company has branched out to cover the English capital of London. The firm's brands include Grubhub, Seamless, Eat24, AllMenus and MenuPages.


The stock was down 2.8% at 104.77 on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), dropping back below a 105.78 entry. Grubhub initially broke out from a [double bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/) last week, but volume was so-so. It also hit resistance at its prior high afterward.


While Grubhub set an intraday high of 113.61 on Tuesday, the stock finished well below that mark, and its Relative Strength line that day didn't hit a new high, a bearish sign. But if Grubhub can top its 113.61 high in big volume, that would be a buy signal.


Meanwhile, the stock boasts excellent fundamentals, which is reflected in its unbeatable [IBD Composite Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/composite-rating-cma--smartselect-rgr-) of 99. It also boasts a top notch [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99.


**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which has its own food delivery service, was down 0.4%. As well as smaller outlets, Grubhub also delivers from the likes of **Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)) and **Denny's** ([DENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DENN)). Back in February it signed a partnership with **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) to be its exclusive [online delivery partner for Taco Bell and KFC](https://www.investors.com/news/taco-bell-parent-yum-brands-serves-mixed-earnings-teams-up-with-grubhub/).

Grubhub's Cautionary Notes
--------------------------


However, the stock has already made mammoth gains in the last 12 months. Its value has risen by around 140% from its closing mark of 43.88 this time last year, reducing the odds for another big run-up.


The Relative Strength has also been lagging and has slid this week. Ideally, the line will hit a new high before the stock breaks out. But if not, then look for the line to at least follow the stock in tandem to a new high, confirming a buy signal.


In addition, the stock has been enjoying annual EPS growth above 25% for the past three years, a key [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) requirement. Analysts see EPS growing by 47% this year, but then slowing to 27% growth in 2019.

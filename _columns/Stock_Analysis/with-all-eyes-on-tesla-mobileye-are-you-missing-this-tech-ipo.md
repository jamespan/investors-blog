While there's no shortage of focus being put on Elon Musk's **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and driver-assistance technology innovator **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), investors should also keep an eye on another car-related tech stock: **CDK Global** ([CDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDK)).


Mobileye reported earnings before the market open Tuesday, beating estimates for both the top and bottom lines. But the stock fell sharply in early trading on reports its [relationship with Tesla](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mobileye-brakes-after-saying-its-no-longer-working-with-tesla/) would not go further than the EyeQ3 processor currently used in Tesla models. Tesla is scheduled to release its latest numbers on Aug. 3.


On July 18, CDK released preliminary results for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, ended June 30. CEO Brian McDonald said it was "an exceptionally strong" report, with year-over-year earnings increasing 75% on an adjusted basis. The company is scheduled to report final audited results on Aug. 3.


Self-Driving Don't Just Sell Themselves…
----------------------------------------


The emergence of electric vehicles, self-driving cars and Internet of Things (IoT) features is clearly revolutionizing the automobile industry, with Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and all the major car manufacturers joining Tesla in the race to market and market share.


But as innovative, connected and exciting as these new semi-autonomous and self-driving cars may be, they don't sell themselves. And that's where CDK Global comes in.


The Illinois-based company, which went public in October 2014 and has over $2 billion in annual revenue, is a leading provider of information technology and digital marketing solutions that help dealers navigate the changing car-buying landscape.


Last week, CDK launched a [Customer Experience Center](http://www.cdkglobal.com/company/media-center/cdk-global-officially-opens-new-cincinnati-based-customer-experience-center) in Cincinnati, which will "incorporate best-in-class technology and service models" to assist CDK's dealer clients. Earlier, the company launched CDK Connected Store, an online car buying solution for dealers that allows shoppers to select a down payment, determine trade-in value and get credit information.


Test-Driving New Buy Point
--------------------------


CDK Global broke out of an IPO base just four weeks after going public, rising over 80% in seven months.


The stock began pulling back in June 2015 to form what became a 50-week long, first-stage [cup-shaped base](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2).


CDK just barely poked its head above the 57.99 entry on June 9, but it immediately pulled back to start forming a [flat base](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=3) as the second element of a base-on-base formation.


The decline within the pattern was just 10%, and the stock found support at the 10-week line.


CDK is now testing a 58.26 ahead of its earnings report.

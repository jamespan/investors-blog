The rapid rise of smart devices, smart cars and smart homes is driving demand for **Akamai** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)), the pioneer of content delivery networks (CDNs). But the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has also created more competition, including that from cloud services giant **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).




Although Amazon has become the largest [cloud services provider](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Akamai remains the largest CDN with over 200,000 servers across 130 countries.


In addition to clients like **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) and **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)), many key government agencies rely on Akamai for both content delivery and security.


Akamai's government clientele includes the U.S. Army, Census Bureau, the Departments of State and Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Amazon also has its own content delivery network, known as CloudFront. Clients include Hulu, **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)), PBS and **TrueCar** ([TRUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRUE)).


Earlier this month, Akamai announced Akamai Connector, a new integration with Salesforce Commerce Cloud to enhance speed and reliability for Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) platforms.

Leading Stock In Highly Rated Industry
--------------------------------------


Akamai earns a 92 Composite Rating, putting it in the No. 3 spot within the Internet-Network Solutions industry group. **Tucows** ([TCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCX)) and **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) hold the top two rankings within the group.


In Q1, Akamai delivered a 22% spike in earnings growth, up from a 1% decline in the fourth quarter. Revenue growth also rose, from 7% to 11%.


Analysts expect earnings to rise again in Q2 to 29%.


A B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 up/down volume ratio and a rise in fund ownership last quarter all point to Institutional demand for Akamai's shares.


Cup-With-Handle Breakout Ahead?
-------------------------------


Akamai is working on an early-stage cup with handle showing a 77.69 entry. Since May 22, the stock has twice tried to clear that buy point, falling back below it on both occasions.


The relative strength line has been climbing, but remains below a new high.


On Wednesday, Akamai rose 0.3% to 76.08, putting it around 2% below the entry.



Rival Amazon has also recently formed a cup with handle. The e-commerce giant has already broken out and remains within the 1,568.62 to 1,647.05 buy zone. It closed Wednesday's session up 0.8% to 1,624.89.


Salesforce reported after Tuesday's market close, beating analyst estimates for both earnings and sales, but delivering mixed guidance. On Wednesday, Salesforce rose nearly 2% to retake the 128.97 buy point it initially cleared on May 9. Volume was more than double the stock's daily average, but Salesforce did give back a significant portion of the day's gains to close in the lower half of the price range.

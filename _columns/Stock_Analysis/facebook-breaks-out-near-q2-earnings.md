As Facebook's stock outperforms social media rivals **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), are the big bets placed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg about to pay off?

  

In 2014, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) bought virtual reality pioneer Oculus VR for $2 billion. At the 2015 E3 video game conference, [Oculus unveiled its VR gaming goggles](http://news.investors.com/technology-click/061115-756877-oculus-rift-vr-googles-due-out-in-q1-2016.htm), which are expected to go on sale in the first quarter of 2016.

  

Last February, Facebook spent nearly $22 billion to buy messaging service WhatsApp and paid $1 billion for Instagram in 2012.

  

The social media giant is still exploring ways to monetize both services, but a Cowen and Co. analyst thinks [Instagram could generate $5.8 billion in revenue](http://news.investors.com/technology/062915-759254-instagram-buy-it-button-risks-alienating-users.htm) by 2020.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Facebook posted mixed results for Q1, beating on earnings but missing on revenue. It's expected to release Q2 numbers on July 29.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 14%, followed by a 33% gain in 2016.

  

Facebook's 18% return on equity and 59% five-year average EPS growth rate help it earn a solid 96 Composite Rating.

  

The B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since breaking out of a cup-with-handle last summer, the stock has traded essentially sideways, hitting resistance around the 80 to 85 range.

  

On June 23, Facebook cleared the 86.17 buy point in a flat base on volume 114% above average.

  

While the breakout has struggled to gain traction, the stock has found support around the buy point and has been floating near or within the 86.17-to-90.48 buy zone in recent days. Also, the relative strength line remains near new high ground.

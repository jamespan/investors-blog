**Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) come from different industries, but they do have one thing in common: they were all featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-analysis/) this year before launching big price moves.


They also offer valuable lessons on [how to buy stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) and [when to sell stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) to lock in your profits.


**Weibo** was featured in the [March 24 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/two-factors-driving-explosive-growth-for-the-twitter-of-china/), just before it launched a 191% gain over the next six months. During that run, the so-called Twitter of China found support along the 10-week line, making it easier to hold than a more volatile stock. Weibo may now be forming the right side of a new double bottom pattern.


**Acacia Communications** is a leader in the fast-growing cloud computing space and nearly tripled in price from an IPO base formed after its initial public offering in May. Acacia was [featured on July 7](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/2016-tech-ipos-acacia-communications/), just as it was launching that run. The stock began flashing warning signs and selling off in September.


**Veeva Systems**, which develops cloud-based sales and marketing software for the lifesciences industry, was covered in the [May 19 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/veeva-systems-q1-earnings-cloud-software-lifesciences/) as it cleared a 28.05 entry.  It rose over 50% in three months before building a new base.



**Dave & Buster's** gapped up in huge volume on Dec. 7, after reporting 108% earnings growth for Q3. Prior to that, the restaurant chain was [featured on Nov. 17](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/restaurant-stocks-dave-busters-buffalo-wild-wings-jack-in-the-box-texas-roadhouse-near-buy-zones/) while forming a double bottom.


The stock has been consolidating those gains while finding support along its 10-day moving average.


**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) was testing an 87.72 buy point when it was [highlighted on Nov. 15](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/no-1-ranked-cloud-networking-stock-floating-near-buy-zone/). A week later, the maker of cloud networking software and hardware jumped over 7% in massive volume and has continued to edge higher.


Prepare To Profit
-----------------


Of course, not every stock featured in the IBD Stock Analysis or highlighted in the [IBD 50 or other IBD stock lists](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) will generate those types of gains. But Weibo and other top stocks of 2016 show money-making opportunities do emerge every year.

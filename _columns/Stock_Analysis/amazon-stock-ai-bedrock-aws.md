Much of the buzz around Magnificent Seven stocks like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) stems from the boom in artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stock continues to lay down an AI "bedrock" in collaboration with tech firms like **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) and even Meta to help a wide range of companies build their generative AI strategies.




At the heart of this approach is [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models through a single API, or application programming interface. Amazon Bedrock also enables a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy and responsible AI.


Expanding this strategy, [Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and SAP](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/5/aws-and-sap-unlock-new-innovation-with-generative-ai) unlocked a new integration last month. A generative AI hub in [SAP AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core) integrates with foundation models in Amazon Bedrock. The goal is to deliver generative AI-driven insights and streamline manual processes for enterprise customers.


An [impressive lineup of companies](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdxGUL7B_Gv45OG4-NECKcS), ranging from **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) to **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)), have tapped into the Amazon Bedrock platform.

Amazon Stock Lays Groundwork For Breakout
-----------------------------------------


While [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [Apple](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/), [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) and [Alphabet](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) all trade at or near all-time highs, [Amazon continues to work](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/is-amazon-stock-buy-now-amzn/) on a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) showing a 191.70 buy point. It popped back above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) Thursday and rose again on Friday. A breakout would lift the e-commerce and cloud computing giant to a record high of its own.


[Meta stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-buy-now/) continues to refurbish its own base following a sharp drop after its April earnings report. Plus, Microsoft has rebounded into buy range after clearing a 430.82 buy point in May. Shares of MSFT joined Google stock in teasing yet more record highs to end the week.


On Thursday, Nvidia stock blasted out to yet another record high, briefly hitting the 14o mark following its recent [stock split](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-gets-price-target-hikes-post-split/). But the AI chip giant then reversed lower to close down more than 3% in heavy volume. Nvidia fell again on Friday to post a 4% drop for the week. While Nvidia may shake off the recent pressure and resume its climb, investors should keep in mind the [eight "secrets" of selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks-nvidia-nvda-stock/). No. 2 is key.


On April 30, [Amazon reported 216% earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-gains-on-earnings-beat-strong-cloud-growth/). Sales grew 13% to $143.3 billion. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings to rise 87% to $1.22 per share leading to a full-year gain of 76%, to $5.10 a share. In 2024, Wall Street forecasts a 25% rise to $6.39 per share.


On Thursday, Amazon stock found support at and jumped off its 10-week line, closing with a nearly 2% in strong volume. Unlike Nvidia, Amazon refused to give back the day's early gains. Up again Friday, Amazon is now climbing farther above its 10-week line as it takes aim at the 191.70 entry.


Amazon's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has remained in a downward trajectory since the current flat base began forming, but has started to perk up. Look for the RS line to trend upward to show rising market leadership.

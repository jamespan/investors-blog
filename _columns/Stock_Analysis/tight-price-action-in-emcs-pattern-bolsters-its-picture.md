With the market making hesitant moves in recent months, many leading stocks are forming base-on-base patterns. **EMC Corp.** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)) is one of them.

  

The stock began carving a flat base in March and April 1. The start of the base in this case was vague, so some chart readers may regard February as the start of the pattern 2.

  

EMC broke out in heavy volume 3 as it reported strong quarterly results, but shares climbed just a little. They quickly got knocked back down.

  

EMC now seems to be forming another flat base 4.

  

Whenever a base forms right on top of another, that's considered a base-on-base formation. Even though the first breakout results in modest gains, this is still considered a bullish pattern.

  

To find the buy point, use the highest point in the base, then add 10 cents. That makes the potential buy point for this one 28.83.

  

The tight price action in several parts of the base is constructive.

  

A solid prior uptrend and a Relative Strength line near new highs 5 are other positive elements of this chart.

While **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)), **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are larger players in the customer relationship management space, **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) is a fast-growing provider of CRM solutions. And its new Slack integration and 400% earnings growth may lift HubSpot into a new buy zone.




Last week, HubSpot announced the launch of its [new Slack integration](https://ir.hubspot.com/investors/news-and-events/press-release-details/2018/HubSpot-Unveils-New-Slack-Integration-and-Plans-for-a-Deeper-Product-Connection/default.aspx), which turns conversations on the popular cloud-based collaboration tool into HubSpot CRM Tasks.


Slack, a cloud-based set of collaboration tools and services, currently has 8 million daily active users. Microsoft was reportedly interested in buying it for $8 billion in 2016. According to the privately held company, Slack is "the fastest-growing business application in history."


Last July, HubSpot acquired Kemvi, a startup focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to help sales representatives deepen relationships with potential buyers.


In September, HubSpot bought Motion AI, a top visual-chatbot builder whose technology allows anyone to create chatbots on Facebook Messenger, Slack and other platforms. Chatbots are programs designed to handle interactions with online users.

HubSpot Vs. Salesforce.com
--------------------------


Based in Cambridge, Mass., HubSpot was founded in 2006 and now has over 44,500 total customers, including [2015 IPO](https://www.hubspot.com/customers/shopify) **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). Earlier this month, HubSpot launched a new integration with the Shopify App Store.


Like industry leader Salesforce and its other larger rivals, HubSpot provides cloud-based CRM, marketing, sales and customer-service solutions.


In 2017, HubSpot posted $375.6 million in revenue, a 39% increase vs. 2016. By comparison, Salesforce generated $10.48 billion in sales for fiscal 2018 (ended Jan. 31), a 25% year-over-year gain.


While HubSpot doesn't share Salesforce's long-term track record of strong profitability, earnings growth has been rising sharply in recent reports.


In each quarter of 2017, HubSpot posted triple-digit earnings growth. While those gains were based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed a loss, HubSpot's Q1 2018 numbers were not. The company posted a 400% spike in earnings growth compared with last year's also-profitable first quarter.


Salesforce's earnings growth has ranged from 25% to 155% over the last four quarters.


Building A New Breakout Move?
-----------------------------


Hubspot was featured in theÂ [Sept. 22, 2017, IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/will-ai-chatbots-program-new-breakout-for-top-tech-ipo-hubspot/) as it was testing a 76.20 buy point. The stock broke out a few days later, rising more than 60% before pulling back in March to form its current base.


The somewhat sloppy consolidation is showing a conventional buy point of 124.55 and a more aggressive entry at 120.75. On Tuesday, HubSpot gained 1.4% to 119 in volume that was rising but still below average. The relative strength line is just shy of near new-high territory.


In another sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day moving average recently moved back above the longer-term 50-day line.



While HubSpot sports a lowly D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.2 up/down volume ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand. Look for the A/D Rating to improve to a C or better as HubSpot builds the right side of the base.


Salesforce, meanwhile, is trying to retake the 128.97 buy point it initially cleared on May 9. The stock briefly poked its head above the entry Thursday and again on Friday before retreating.


After the close Thursday, [Salesforce reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-earnings-saas-stocks-technology/), showing a 155% spike in earnings growth. The stock was up after hours, putting it on pace to retake the buy point if those gains hold through Wednesday's open.

Even tech titans like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) could use a lift in their [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) initiatives. [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **Jamf** ([JAMF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAMF)) is there to help.




Since going public in 2020, Jamf, along with 2021 IPO **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), has already established itself as one of the top [IPOs](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/). Jamf has also established its position as the standard in [Apple Enterprise Management](https://www.jamf.com/#why-jamf).


Solely focused on the Apple ecosystem, Jamf helps industry leaders around the world personalize Apple devices to meet specific needs and automate the entire life cycle of Apple management. Through its cloud platform, the Minneapolis-based company remotely connects, manages and protects Apple users and devices.


In addition to its relationship with Apple, Jamf already has an impressive list of clients, including Salesforce. In fact, seven of Fortune's Top 10 technology companies use Jamf. Forbes also reports that 23 of the 25 most valuable brands are Jamf clients. Plus, eight of the Top 10 largest companies on the Fortune 500 turn to Jamf for help with Apple Cloud issues, as do eight of the Top 10 global apparel companies as ranked by BizVibe.


Jamf operates in three core sectors: business, education and health care.

Apple Partnership Spurs Jamf Growth
-----------------------------------


Strength in Apple appears to be rubbing off on Jamf. After slipping earlier, [AAPL stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) came off its lows Friday as it continues to near a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and all-time high, while JAMF stock is floating its own [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) bid.


Sales growth for Jamf has been solid and steady. Over the last eight quarters, the company has posted revenue gains ranging from 29% to 39%.


As often happens for IPOs, earnings for Jamf are now kicking in on the heels of sales growth. The cloud IPO posted 50% EPS growth in Q2. Over the four quarters prior to that, Jamf delivered triple-digit earnings increases, three of which were based on comparisons to prior-year quarters.


For the full year, analysts expect 33% earnings growth followed by a 50% increase in 2022.


Jamf Among IPOs Near A Buy Point
--------------------------------


As AAPL stocks finds support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) as it sets up and [CRM stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-buy-now/) becomes extended beyond its [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), Jamf joins fellow cloud IPO Monday.com near a potential breakout. While Jamf is on [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), Monday.com, which was featured earlier this week on the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/ipos-to-watch-monday-com-nears-breakout-with-earnings-due/), earns a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for both stocks is at a new 52-week high, meriting a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/). Having now completed a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), which takes at least five days to form, the buy point for Jamf is 49.01. Volume came in well above average on Friday to close out the week.


The entry for Monday.com is 425.94. The stock has been finding support at its 50-day moving average.


Jamf reports earnings on Nov. 11, the day after Monday.com is set to release its latest numbers.


Keep in mind that earnings season can be risky. That's particularly true for newer IPOs, which don't have a long trading history to reference.

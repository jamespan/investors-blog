Led by companies like **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), [oil & gas stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) have been pumping out solid gains recently, and now 2016 IPO **Centennial Resource Development** ([CDEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDEV)) may be primed to launch its own breakout.









 
 
 Over the last six months, the Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group has moved up in IBD's industry rankings from No. 191 to No. 30.
Centennial Resource Development and Continental Resources both have a 91 Composite Rating and share the No. 11 ranking among their industry peers. Diamondback Energy holds the No. 2 ranking with a 96.


Triple-Digit EPS & Sales Growth
-------------------------------


Headquartered in Denver, Centennial Resource Development acquires and develops liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas.


The company's revenue growth has ranged from 290% to 309% over the last three quarters, and it has a three-year annual growth rate of 102%.


Earnings have also accelerated, with three consecutive quarters of triple-digit gains. But note that those numbers are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed a loss.


Institutional investors have taken note, and the number of funds with a position in Centennial has risen for six straight quarters. Plus, three typically top-performing funds own shares: Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)) and Fidelity OTC ([FOCPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCPX)).


Primed To Break Out?
--------------------


Centennial more than doubled in price in the eight months following its April 2016 IPO. It then pulled back to form a 46-week long consolidation, which it broke out of last November.


But that climb was short-lived, as the stock quickly reversed to form its current third-stage base.


The stock found support at the 50-day moving average while building the right side of the pattern, and the 10-day line has moved back above its longer-term cousin â€” a sign of renewed technical strength.


On Wednesday, Centennial came within pennies of the 22.21 buy point before reversing to close nearly 2% lower for the day and 3% below the entry.



Continental Resources, which rose 0.8% Wednesday, and Diamondback Energy, which fell 1.5%, are both currently out of buy range. See if they go on to form a new base and buying opportunity.

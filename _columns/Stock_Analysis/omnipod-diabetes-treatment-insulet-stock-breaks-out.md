As demand for insulin, a primary diabetes treatment, continues to grow, **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) has developed the Omnipod Delivery System, an innovative way to administer the glucose-regulating hormone. The Omnipod has also helped Insulet deliver explosive earnings growth and a new breakout.




Rather than using a needle to inject insulin, diabetes patients simply attach Omnipod to their bodies with adhesive. According to the Massachusetts-based company, the delivery platform automatically administers the drug for the patient's unique specifications, reducing the potential for missed or inaccurate dosing.


One disposable and waterproof Omnipod can provide up to three days of nonstop insulin delivery, without the inconvenience of using a needle. Insulet produces over 10 million Omnipods each year, serving over 100,000 insulin-dependent diabetes patients.


In 2018, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Insulet's Omnipod Dash system, which consists of a touch-screen personal diabetes manager (PDM) and Bluetooth-enabled tubeless pod.

Diabetes Treatment Drives No. 1-Rated Medical Products Stock
------------------------------------------------------------


With a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Insulet earns the No. 2 rating among medical products stocks. **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) and **Lantheus** ([LNTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNTH)) share top billing with a 97 rating. **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) is just behind Insulet with a 95 Composite Rating.


Over the last three years, Insulet has generated annual average sales growth of 25%. Annual profit margins (0.9%) and return on equity (1.8%) have been far less impressive, leaving the stock with a mediocre C [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-4/).


But for three straight quarters, Insulet has generated triple-digit earnings growth, albeit based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss. Look for that trend to continue in the second quarter, with analysts expecting 166% EPS growth, again compared to a year-ago quarter that had a loss. Analysts are looking for a 520% increase in earnings for the full year and a 168% rise in 2020. Estimates for both years were recently raised.


While reporting Q1 numbers on May 2, the company raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $667 million to $690 million, up from $662 million to $687 million.

Base-Count Reset, New Breakout For Insulet Stock
------------------------------------------------


While forming what became a 33-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) during last year's bear market, Insulet undercut the low in its prior chart pattern. That [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making the cup with handle a first-stage base.


After reporting another triple-digit EPS gain for Q1 on May 2, Insulet started to rise sharply in heavy volume as it approached a 102.04 buy point, clearing it on May 6. The stock moved beyond the 102.04 — 107.14 buy range, but it pulled back 2.1% in light volume Wednesday, leaving it just a penny above the upper limit at 107.15.


While it's best to avoid making new buys during a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/), Insulet stock may be one to watch given its innovative products, strong sales growth and emerging profitability.


Institutional investors seem to think so.


Insulet sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-is-key-in-a-base/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, three leading funds on the IBD Mutual Fund Index ([0MUTI) own the stock: Invesco Mid Cap Growth (VGRAX), Columbia Acorn (ACRNX) and Alger Small Cap Growth (ALSCX). In fact, Alger Small Cap Growth has approximately 2.6% of the fund's assets invested in Insulet.


In Monday morning trading, Insulet is continuing to show support at its 10-day moving average despite selling pressure in the general market. Its relative strength line remains near a new 52-week high, a sign of market-leading strength.


The stock has run into resistance around 110 in recent days, so look for Insulet to break through and stay above that price area in solid volume.

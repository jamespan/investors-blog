Founded in 2014 and with an [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) in 2019, **New Fortress Energy** ([NFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFE)) is a leader in liquefied natural gas, or LNG. NFE stock is now looking to generate a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in bear market where [energy stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) remain one of the few bright spots. The stock earns a spot on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/).




With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), NFE stock ties **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and several others for top billing in the integrated oil and gas industry. The group ranks No. 5 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


New Fortress Energy was founded with the belief that access to affordable, reliable, clean energy is a human right. The company notes that over a billion people lack access to electricity. Hundreds of millions more live with unreliable or expensive power.


New Fortress Energy has six operations in Latin America and four in the Caribbean. It also has a presence in the U.S., Europe and Asia.


It works with [partners](https://www.newfortressenergy.com/operations), such as **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), to provide LNG energy solutions to lower energy costs, reduce environmental footprints and improve energy efficiency.


New Fortress Energy Eyes Zero-Carbon Green Hydrogen
---------------------------------------------------


With a current goal of modernizing energy and power infrastructure in emerging countries, New Fortress Energy supplies more affordable and cleaner LNG. In the future, the company aims toÂ provide zero-carbon energy in the form of green hydrogen.


New Fortress Energy has generated impressive sales growth. Last quarter, the company delivered a 247% spike in revenue. It has generated average annual sales growth of 142% over the last three years.


Earnings growth has been more sporadic. On May 4, New Fortress Energy posted 638% EPS growth, but that was based on a comparison with a loss in the prior-year quarter. Also compared with a loss in the prior year, analysts expect the LNG company to notch 1,833% growth in the current quarter.


Although neither New Frontier Energy nor [Chevron](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/chevron-tests-support-as-oil-stocks-lead-troubled-market/) made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-aapl-brkb-pm-stock-in-market-correction-as-new-uptrend-awaits/), NFE stock has seen strong institutional demand.

Clean Energy Powers Support For NFE Stock
-----------------------------------------


New Fortress Energy is holding above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) and is forming a new consolidation. NFE stock has also just found support at its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The potential new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 49.40 in a [second-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


As energy sector trends power the moves of New Fortress Energy and Chevron, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for both stocks is right around a new high.

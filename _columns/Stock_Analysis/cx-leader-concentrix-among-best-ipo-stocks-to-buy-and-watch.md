Founded in 1983, **Concentrix** ([CNXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNXC)) is a global leader in CX â€” the design, development and deployment of customer experiences. Now the Silicon Valley-based company is trying to launch a new breakout and further establish itself as one of the [best IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) to buy and watch.




Formerly a subsidiary of IT systems and networking equipment distributor **Synnex** ([SNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNX)), Concentrix went public in December 2020.


The company is truly global in scale. Concentrix operates in 40 countries across six continents, managing CX development in more than 70 languages.


[Concentrix clients](/Users/galgani/Downloads/CNX-Fact-Sheet_MAY2021v1.pdf) include leading global brands, hailing from a wide range of industries. Four of the top five U.S. health care providers use its CX services, as do eight of the top 10 car brands. Five of the top 10 e-commerce players use Concentrix, as well as seven of the top 10 U.S. technology companies.


Helping to accelerate the CX digital transformation for clients, Concentrix offerings include Automation & Optimization, Customer Engagement Centers, Analytics & Consulting and Experience Design & Mobility.


CX Demand Drives 249% Earnings Growth For Concentrix
----------------------------------------------------


Last fiscal quarter, Concentrix delivered accelerating growth in both earnings (249%) and sales (28%). In its next quarterly report, analysts expect a 155% EPS gain. Consensus analyst estimates call for 100% earnings growth for the full fiscal year.


Over the last three years, Concentrix has averaged annual revenue growth of 34%.


Concentrix sports a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), meaning it's outperformed 98% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). Fellow enterprise software leader **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) tops the group with the highest-possible score of 99.


IPO Stocks To Buy And Watch: Concentrix Designs New Buy Point
-------------------------------------------------------------


Since its stock market debut on Dec. 1, Concentrix has quickly established itself as one of the best IPOs to watch. From the end of its first week of trading until starting to form its latest [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), the CX leader rose 61%.


Concentrix is now trying to break out of a [second-stage flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) showing a 163.38 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock briefly cleared that entry on June 29 but has since run into resistance.


In a sign of resilience, Concentrix has found support at its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) as it tries to recapture its original buy point. After rising 1.5% Friday, the stock ended the week just shy of that entry.


With CX demand helping Concentrix show technical power compared to the S&P 500, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) remains within striking distance of a new high.

Ten building sector stocks made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-fund-buys-portfolios-cemented-with-u-s-concrete-ulta-beauty/), indicating strong institutional demand for the industry.


**Universal Forest Products** ([UFPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UFPI)) was among the top-rated names making the grade, along with **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)), **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)), **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) and **Drew Industries** ([DW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DW)).


Spending Bills Boost Demand
---------------------------


Through 100 facilities in North America and Australia, Universal Forest Products manufactures lumber, composite wood and other building products for the retail, construction and industrial markets.


Like U.S. Concrete, **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) and other building products providers, Universal Forest Products is expected to benefit from increased infrastructure and transportation spending approved by Congress last year.


This month, the company has announced two acquisitions. It is purchasing Florida-based Robbins Manufacturing to enhance its presence in the preservative-treated market, as well as building products distributor Idaho Western to bolster its foothold in the manufactured housing and retail markets.


With a 97 Composite Rating, Universal Forest Products holds the top rating within the Buildingâ€“Wood Products industry group, which ranks No. 36 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


The Grand Rapids, Mich.-based company sports a strong 54% three-year annual EPS growth rate, while its three-year annual sales growth is a more moderate 10%.


Trying To Construct New Breakout
--------------------------------


While the stock yelled "timber" a few times along the way, Universal Forest Products rose over 50% from mid-July 2015 until pulling back to begin forming its current flat base in April.


The stock jumped higher on June 14 and 15, temporarily clearing the new 89.01 buy point in good volume before pulling back to close just below the entry.


Universal Forest Products found support at the short-term 10-day moving average line and poked its head above the buy point again on Monday, before closing below it once more.


The Relative Price Strength line has been trending higher and is near new high ground, meaning the stock is showing resilience in the face of an uncertain market.


Early Tuesday, Universal Forest Products was again testing the 89.01 entry.

**NQ Mobile** ([NQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NQ)) provides productivity software and security for mobile devices. It's based in China and was profiled in an Aug. 1 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/073113-665877-nq-mobile-stock-price-new-high.htm).

  

The firm's Mobile Security product protects users' mobile voice and data from malicious software, data theft and privacy intrusion.

  

Another product, Mobile Vault, uses active control encryption to make sure users' digital privacy is protected.

  

NQ also offers mobile games, advertising and other services.

  

Analysts say NQ has been accelerating its partnerships and geographic outreach. It has also broadened its market.

  

Last month NQ said it's buying the remaining stake in its Beijing NationSky Technology unit. NationSky provides mobile services to more than 1,000 enterprises in China.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•The company has scored a long string of triple-digit sales growth gains.

  

• Last week it weighed in with second-quarter sales and earnings results that topped views.

  

• In all, earnings growth has ranged from 46% to 86% during the past three quarters.

  

• Going forward, analysts predict earnings will climb 58% this year and 26% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-nq-mobile-inc-ads-nq.aspx) shows NQ is tied with **Sourcefire** ([FIRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIRE)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) for the best Composite Rating among the 21 stocks in its Computer Software-Security industry group. Sourcefire is being bought by Cisco.

  

NQ also has the group's best EPS, Relative Strength, SMR and Accumulation/Distribution ratings.

  

And the group itself is ranked No. 13 among IBD's 197 groups. So it's been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

NQ came public in 2011, then traded sideways for a few years. But it's scored some big gains this summer.

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows NQ broke out of a double-bottom base in mid-July and quickly invoked the eight-week-hold rule.

  

That rule says that if your stock surges at least 20% within three weeks of breaking out from a proper base, you should hold on for at least eight weeks.

  

But there are exceptions, for instance if your stock starts to flash sell signals, you may consider selling and locking in some gains.

  

The same is true if the market falls into a correction.

  

In NQ's case, the market did fall into a correction. But so far it hasn't flashed sell signals.

  

With stocks like that investors might hold on depending on how much of a profit cushion they have and their level of conviction about the company.

  

Something else to consider with NQ is that it's trading more than 100% above its 200-day moving average line and that can be a concern.

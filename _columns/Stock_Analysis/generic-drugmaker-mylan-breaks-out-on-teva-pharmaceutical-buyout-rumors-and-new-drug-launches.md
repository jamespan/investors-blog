**Mylan** ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)) shot up almost 7% Wednesday on rumors that it had hired an investment banker and might be sold to fellow generic drugmaker, **Teva Pharmaceutical Industries** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)). The stock also got a boost from the [launch of new drugs](http://news.investors.com/technology/031115-742968-mylan-stock-moves-as-pharma-firm-launches-drugs.htm) to treat pain and opioid dependence, and to manage sobriety for patients with chronic alcoholism.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After two quarters of single-digit growth, the Pennsylvania-based company has shown stronger earnings and revenue in the last two reports. Fourth-quarter EPS growth came in at 35%, while revenue rose 15%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to grow 16%, followed by a 13% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Mylan sports a stellar 46% return on equity and strong EPS Rating of 96, which means that, in terms of quarterly and annual earnings growth, it's outpacing 96% of all stocks. The Medical-Generic Drugs industry group has also shown strength, with a 99 Group RS Rating and a No. 3 ranking among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.

  

Overall, the stock earns a 98 Composite Rating and B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating. As you like to see, the number of funds with a position in Mylan has been rising in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After breaking out of a first-stage base-on-base pattern in July 2013, Mylan rose over 70% in just 32 weeks. The stock then fell into a long, 38-week consolidation.

  

It tried to break out last November but quickly pulled back to start forming its current, later-stage base. Mylan struggled to get above the 10-week line while building that pattern. The stock's uncertainty was reflected in the volume, with a mix of up and down weeks in above-average trading.

  

The buy point is 59.70, 10 cents above the peak on the left. Mylan cleared that entry during Wednesday's session but closed below it. Volume was huge, 268% higher than normal.

  

A stock's buying range is up to 5% above its ideal buy point. For Mylan, that's from 59.70 to 62.69. As of early Thursday morning, the stock was trading within that range.

After landing a spot on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-report-apple-googl-microsoft-under-pressure-while-vertex-lilly-weather-market-storm/), **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) is fighting to pin down a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). WWE stock is looking to retake an earlier buy point as it wrestles with a key [moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).




Earlier this month, [WrestleMania 38](https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2022/04-04-2022-140715499) became WWE's highest-grossing and most-attended event in company history. Over the course of two nights, 156,352 fans from all 50 states and 53 countries converged on AT&T Stadium in Dallas to witness the pop culture event. That beat previous gate and attendance records set by WrestleMania 32 in 2016.


In conjunction with promoting WrestleMania 38, WWE teamed up with **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)). The new partnership brings all of WWE's Premium Live Events to Dave & Buster's 140 locations nationwide.


Having already secured a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), WWE enters the earnings ring on May 5. After delivering 192% earnings growth last quarter, analysts expect the Connecticut-based company to post a 27% EPS increase for Q1.


Over the last three years, WWE has posted average annual earnings growth of 42%.

World Wrestling Entertainment Programs Global Powerhouse
--------------------------------------------------------


With its lineup of television programming, premium live events, digital media and publishing platforms, WWE is a leader in global entertainment. The company's family-friendly TV-PG programming can be seen in more than a billion homes worldwide in 30 languages.


Distribution partners include NBCUniversal, FOX Sports, BT Sport, Sony India and Rogers Media. WWE's massive video-on-demand library is available in more than 180 countries. In the U.S., NBCUniversal's streaming service, Peacock, is the exclusive home to WWE Network.


With a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), WWE stock earns top billing in the diversified media industry group. The company also earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


WWE Stock Holds 50-Day Line, Stares Down Buy Zone
-------------------------------------------------


In March, WWE stock moved past a 60.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/). But the current [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) put a chokehold on the stock, creating resistance right around that entry.


WWE had been shown resilience, but fell through its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) to close out the week.


Volume on down days in the post-breakout pullback has been mostly light, including on Friday's nearly 4% retreat. The one spike in downside volume on April 7 was actually a day of support. WWE stock bounced off its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and closed in the upper half of the price range.


With earnings due next week, see if WWE can bounce back like a wrestler off the ropes and retake its earlier buy zone.

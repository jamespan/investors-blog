After nearly a year of essentially sideways trading, is payment processing leader **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) ready to take a swipe at a new breakout? Perhaps its Q4 earnings report on Jan. 30 will provide PayPal stock with the boost it needs to break out and run.




With a 96 Composite Rating, PayPal shares the No. 2 spot among its payment processing peers with **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)) share top billing with a 97 rating. The group ranks a middling No. 70 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


In November, PayPal announced the completion of its $400 million [acquisition of Hyperwallet](https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paypal-completes-acquisition-hyperwallet). According to PayPal, which was spun off from **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), the purchase will strengthen its "payout capabilities and enhance PayPal's ability to provide an integrated suite of payment solutions to e-commerce platforms and marketplaces around the world."

PayPal Stock On IBD 50
----------------------


PayPal is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), which have a track record of [beating the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


The San Jose, Calif.-based company's earnings growth has ranged from 17% to 31% over the last eight quarters. Revenue gains have come in from 14% to 26% during the same period. But sales growth has slowed over the last three quarters, so look for that trend to reverse in Q4.


Although the number of funds with a position in PayPal stock fell last quarter, 225 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-reit-stocks-medical-stocks/) with an A+ rating own shares.


In December, a MoffettNathanson analyst said that if PayPal extends its partnership with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), it could mean as many as [60 million new members](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/paypal-could-get-big-boost-from-expanded-facebook-partnership-analyst.html) and $1.5 billion in incremental revenue for PayPal.


PayPal Stock Resets Base Count
------------------------------


Over the summer, PayPal formed a third-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). But it has since undercut the low in that consolidation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making its current chart pattern a first-stage base. That's a positive sign, since first-stage patterns are more likely to succeed than later-stage bases. The new buy point is 93.80.


As PayPal pulled back during the recent bear market, it fell below its 50-day moving average but has since recaptured it. That benchmark line also managed to stay above the longer-term 200-day line, a sign of technical resilience.


As the peer-to-peer payment processing pioneer tries to complete the right side of its new base, the relative strength line is already in new-high ground.


On Friday, PayPal stock traded essentially flat to close at 90.65, putting it 3% below the entry.

The latest monthly list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-axon-applovin-tesla-meta-google/) featured an array of fintech stocks, including **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)), **Sezzle** ([SEZL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEZL)), **Fiserv** ([FI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FI)) and China-based **Qifu Technology** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)). But these top money managers also invested more than $46 million into **Corpay** ([CPAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPAY)), which focuses on payment solutions for businesses.


Boosted by such institutional demand, shares of Corpay continue to test a new buy zone as the company expands its global footprint with the launch of multicurrency accounts. But trouble in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) has rattled Corpay and its fintech peers recently.




Headquartered in Atlanta, Corpay provides solutions to help businesses and consumers pay expenses. The S&P 500 member's platform helps customers manage vehicle-related expenses, travel costs and payments to vendors.


On Feb. 12, [Corpay launched its multicurrency accounts](https://www.corpay.com/corporate-newsroom/18346/corpay-cross-border-launches-multi-currency-accounts) system to help clients expand their global footprint with foreign currency management via a single point of access. Corpay aims to simplify the complex process of opening and managing foreign bank accounts, including navigating layers of red tape and language barriers, as well as rates and fees.


As an element of Corpay's existing cross-border business, the new multicurrency accounts system commenced with 12 major currencies.


Top Funds Buy Into Five Fintech Stocks
--------------------------------------


Ranking No. 27 out of the 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily, the specialty financial services industry showcases a slew of highly rated stocks.


In terms of IBD's Composite Ratings, [Sezzle](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-sezzle-sezl.aspx) leads its peers with the highest-possible mark of 99, followed by [Qifu Technology](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-qifu-technology-adr-qfin.aspx).


Corpay comes next with a [96 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-corpay-cpay.aspx). The score means it is outpacing 96% of all stocks in the Investor's Business Daily database in terms of key fundamental and technical factors.


In addition to joining [Coinbase](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-coinbase-global-coin.aspx), Sezzle, [Fiserv](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-fiserv-fi.aspx) and Qifu on the latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds, a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-up-down-volume-ratio-spots-underlying-demand-for-stocks/) points to demand for Corpay.




| Company | Symbol | Comp Rating | EPS Rating | RS Rating | A/D Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sezzle |  ([SEZL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEZL)) | 99 | 83 | 99 | B |
| Qifu Technology |  ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) | 98 | 89 | 97 | A+ |
| Corpay |  ([CPAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPAY)) | 96 | 91 | 84 | C+ |
| Fiserv |  ([FI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FI)) | 95 | 94 | 91 | B |
| Coinbase Global |  ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) | 91 | 82 | 80 | C |


Corpay Stock Retreats To Test Support
-------------------------------------


Since breaking out into buy range just before and after [reporting earnings on Feb. 5](https://www.corpay.com/corporate-newsroom/18321/corpay-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results), Corpay has floated in and out of its buy zone. The initial [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was 385.30 in a second-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle).


Showing some seesaw action in February, Corpay has made multiple tests of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). On Thursday, the stock fell below the 21-day benchmark, but managed to hold support at the 50-day moving average to close the week. So far, that has kept its latest breakout intact, barely avoiding triggering a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/). The stock fell as much as 6% below the 385.30 buy point but came slightly off the day's low to end Friday's session right at the 50-day line.


Among Corpay's fintech peers, Fiserv has shown the most resilience, holding near the top of its buy range. Qifu has pulled off its record highs, but continues to hold support at its 21-day line. Meanwhile, Coinbase has fallen farther below its 10-week line, falling nearly 8% on Friday. Sezzle is trying to steady the ship after a sharp drop off an all-time high in November. It remains above its 50-day line, which remains in a downtrend.

**Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) is up more than 130% since a November 2012 breakout, and is now facing a new test to show if it still has what it takes to keep on rolling higher. The North Carolina-based less-than-truckload carrier has been helped by lower fuel costs that have made truckers like Old Dominion, **J.B. Hunt Transportation Services** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) and **Covenant Transport** ([CVTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVTI)) more competitive with rail and other shipping options.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Old Dominion beat Q4 estimates with its third-straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth and fourth-consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue gains. Old Dominion sports a highest possible 99 Composite Rating and has shown rising fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Old Dominion broke out of a long consolidation in November 2012 and rose 147% by last December. Along the way, the stock generally showed tight trading and good support along the 10-week line.

  

That support was put to the test in October, when the stock fell below the 10-week moving average but managed to stay at about its 40-week line. It flashed a positive reversal by closing the week ended Oct. 17 at the top of the price range and right around the 10-week line. Volume was 89% above average, a sign that some large investors were stepping in to buy.

  

The stock rose for seven straight weeks before starting to form a new base in December. The current pattern is a riskier, later-stage formation, but when Old Dominion tested its 40-week line in February, it once again found support and flashed a positive reversal on heavy volume.

  

The current buy point is 81.58. If Old Dominion forms a handle, the entry would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) operates more than 4,200 auto parts stores in 42 states and is aggressively expanding in Florida. Its Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group has outperformed the broad stock market this year.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has been relatively slow, but steady, ranging from 4% to 10% over the past eight quarters.

  

Earnings growth has ranged from 18% to 37%, but has decelerated modestly the past two quarters. See if that turns around when the company reports second-quarter numbers July 23.

  

O'Reilly sports a stellar 33% return on equity and earns a 93 Composite Rating. Its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate institutional buying in recent weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a yearlong consolidation, O'Reilly started to edge higher in April 2013.

  

It broke out of a flat base in October, but quickly pulled back, reset its base count, and formed a first-stage cup-with-handle base.

  

In February, O'Reilly gapped up on heavy volume after releasing Q4 earnings. Two weeks later, it began work on a new cup with handle. The ideal buy point is 154.31.

  

On Wednesday, the stock moved above that price, but volume was just 19% above average. That's less than the 40% or more that volume should surge on a breakout.

  

O'Reilly pulled back Thursday to close just below the buy point. It has remained slightly below the entry, while holding above the 10-week moving average.

  

Note that the market outlook changed this week to "uptrend under pressure," so it's a time to be more cautious. If you do make new buys, be sure to keep them on a tight leash, selling quickly if the trade goes against you.

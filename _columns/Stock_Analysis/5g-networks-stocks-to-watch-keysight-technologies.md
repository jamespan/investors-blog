As the promise of 5G networks continues to generate increasing buzz, **Keysight Technologies** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)) has emerged as one of the top [under-the-radar 5G stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-wireless-top-stock-picks-goldman-sachs/).




[Telecom giants](https://www.investors.com/news/telecom-stocks-to-watch-and-industry-news/) **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **Sprint** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) and **T-Mobile** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) are aggressively developing so-called fifth-generation or 5G networks to handle the ever-expanding demand for cloud-based, always-connected smart technology.


To bring 5G networks and smart devices to market, wireless service providers and electronics makers turn to Keysight's design simulation and prototype validation technologies to test and optimize their designs and manufacturing processes.


Together with its 5G business, Keysight is also involved in the automotive, energy, defense and data center network security fields, generating $3.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018 (ended July 31).

5G Stocks To Watch: Keysight Expects 56% Growth
-----------------------------------------------


Keysight's role in helping to develop smart technology has attracted institutional investors. The stock has seen three quarters of rising fund ownership, including a spike from 789 to 900 funds last quarter. Plus, 109 mutual funds with an A or A+ rating own shares.


The Santa Rosa, Calif.-based company has seen a nice rebound in earnings recently. EPS growth has ranged from 30% to 46% over the last three quarters, and analysts expect a 56% rise in fiscal 2019 Q1.


Keysight has posted six straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth.


Earlier this month, the company announced a successful demonstration of an IP data transfer using Keysight's [5G network emulation solutions](https://about.keysight.com/en/newsroom/pr/2018/19dec-nr180137.shtml). The demo also involved a smartphone test device consisting of a 5G modem and antenna modules from **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)).


Will 5G Revolution Speed Up New Breakout?
-----------------------------------------


Keysight Technologies had its IPO in 2014. After an initial run, the stock entered a 13-month downtrend before finding a bottom in February 2016. From there, the stock more than tripled in two-and-1/2 years before pulling back in August.


The stock is now working on a new consolidation showing a 70.50 buy point. It's a first-stage base because Keysight undercut the low in the prior pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


In a sign of resilience during the current [market correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is already in new-high ground.


Keep in mind that it's best to wait for a new market uptrend to begin before making any new buys. But with good fundamentals and a leadership position in a potentially game-changing industry, Keysight is among the top stocks to watch in the New Year.


On the final day of trading in 2018, Keysight posted a 3.1% gain to close at 61.99. Early in the first day of trading in 2019, Keysight is off a little over 1% at 61.32. Volume is trending well below average.

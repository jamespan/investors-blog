When looking for [stocks to watch and buy](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), start by focusing on stocks that top mutual fund managers are buying. Mobile and wireless technology leader **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)) fits that bill.
The Delaware-based company made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/grubhub-delivers-food-profit-for-top-funds/), with 18 funds investing approximately $12 million from November to January.


InterDigital also sports an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 2.0 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Strong institutional demand doesn't guarantee success, but it's a [common trait among market winners](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), since it's the funds that fuel a stock's big move.


Triple-Digit Growth
-------------------


InterDigital says it's "creating the living network" through technology that enables faster and more efficient wireless networks and new mobile broadband capabilities.


Already a leader in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that expand industrial automation and health care innovations, the company is aggressively gearing up for the coming 5G revolution and next-generation networks.


In December, it bought sensor processing pioneer Hillcrest Labs, whose technology is found in smart TVs, gaming platforms, smartphones, virtual reality systems and other devices.


Rising demand for all-things-wireless has InterDigital plugged into profits.


It posted a triple-digit spike in earnings (340%) and sales (107%) in Q3, and analysts expect a 317% EPS gain for Q4 and a 157% rise for all of last year when the company reports before the Feb. 23 open.


Mobilizing A Breakout?
----------------------


InterDigital broke out last August, rising as much as 63% before peaking in December. Since then, the stock has been working on a cup base with a 98.10 buy point.



InterDigital has shown good support along its 10-week and 10-day lines, with its relative strength line near new high ground.


See if InterDigital can meet or beat the high expectations for its next report and break out in heavy volume.


**UPDATE:**


In early trade Monday, Feb. 13, InterDigital was breaking out in huge volume, trading at the upper range of the 98.10 - 103 buy zone. As you like to see on a breakout, the Relative Strength line was in new high ground.

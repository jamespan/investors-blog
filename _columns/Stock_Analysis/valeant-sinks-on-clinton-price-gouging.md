Valeant Pharmaceuticals found plenty of company for its market misery last week as drugmakers and biotech stocks sold off after [Hillary Clinton](http://news.investors.com/technology/092115-771997-clinton-drug-price-announcement-rattles-drug-stocks.htm)Â accused Big Pharma of price gouging.

  

**Valeant** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) closed nearly 18% lower for the week, and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) and **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) also fell.

  

As [Bloomberg reported](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-22/hillary-clinton-drug-plan-would-cap-consumer-costs-mandate-r-d-spending), Clinton's plan to cap out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions particularly targets companies like Valeant that rely more on acquisitions of existing drugs than internal R&D.  



  



**Key Numbers**

  

Despite this week's drop, Valeant still sports strong fundamentals.

  

Sales growth accelerated over the past two quarters, and earnings gains have ranged from 20% to 76% in the last eight reports.  



Valeant is expected to release Q3 numbers on Oct. 19. Estimates for full-year EPS growth were recently revised higher to 39%. 

  

The Quebec-based company has a stellar 55% return on equity and 39% annual EPS growth rate. 

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Valeant's current base highlights two important chart-reading concepts. 

  

First, the stock [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern. That makes the current consolidation a first-stage base. 

  

Second, Valeant's recent action highlights how the 10- and 40-week moving averages acts as first and second lines of defense. 

  

The stock fell below the 10-week line, and below the 40-week line last week.

  

See if Valeant can get back above both lines, complete its current base and punch through the former area of resistance, around 263, in heavy volume.

While **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) get the buzz when it comes to electric vehicles and self-driving cars, mutual fund managers are getting behind the wheel of 2014 IPO **CDK Global** ([CDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDK)), which provides IT and digital marketing solutions to auto dealers.


Institutional demand for CDK is reflected in its 2.3 up/down volume ratio, A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and four quarters of rising fund ownership.


On Thursday, while [Tesla skidded on safety concerns](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-skids-as-ntsha-probes-suspension-troublesome-nondisclosure-agreement/), CDK cleared a 57.99 entry in volume 47% above average. The buy zone extends to 60.89.


What Car Buyers Want In Online World
------------------------------------


The digital age is transforming the car buying process, and **CDK Global** ([CDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDK)) is helping auto dealers navigate the changing landscape.


In a recent survey, CDK found that nearly [90% of car shoppers](http://cdkglobal.com/company/media-center/survey-reveals-nearly-ninety-percent-car-shoppers-prefer-dealership-where-they) prefer to start the buying process online, with almost 60% saying they prefer to take those steps on the dealer’s own site, rather than use a third-party service.


The Illinois-based company recently launched CDK Connected Store, an online car buying product for dealers that allows shoppers to select a down payment, determine trade-in value and get credit information before they step onto the lot.


CDK has posted rising earnings growth for three straight quarters, with Q1 showing an EPS gain of 27%. The company has over $2 billion in annual revenue, but sales grew just 2% last quarter.


Will Funds Fuel New Run?
------------------------


CDK Global broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) just four weeks after going public in October 2014, rising over 80% by June 2015.


Since then, the stock has been working on a first-stage cup pattern, showing healthy trading in the right side of the base. During that time, the 10-week line has climbed back above the 40-week moving average, and the relative strength line has moved into new-high ground.

When looking for the [best stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/), start by seeing what the best mutual funds are buying. And right now, leading portfolio managers are pumping funds into leading car stock **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)).




While Ferrari didn't make IBD's latest list of [new buys by top funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-retail-stocks-macys-kohls-amazon/), 97 mutual funds with an A- or higher rating have reported positions in the stock. Ferrari also has eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership.


An A+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-helps/) and 1.8 up/down volume ratio further indicate strong institutional demand.


Ranging from A+ (best) to E (worst), the Accumulation/Distribution Rating measures buying and selling by professional investors. It does that by tracking large share purchases, rather than smaller buys by individual investors.


Ferrari's A+ rating means that over the trailing 13 weeks, fund managers have been aggressively scooping up shares.

No. 1 Ranked Car Stock
----------------------


With a 98 Composite Rating, Ferrari holds the [No. 1 ranking](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ferrari-n-v-race.aspx) within the automakers industry group.


**Fiat Chrysler Automobiles** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)) and **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) round out the top five leaders among car stocks.


Following its October 2015 IPO, Ferrari was spun off by Fiat Chrysler in 2016. Since forming a 47-week long, post-IPO base, Ferrari has zoomed higher. After closing at 55 on its first day of trading, the stock has risen around 170%.


Ferrari, which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), posted accelerating top- and bottom-line growth in its latest report. Earnings growth jumped from 16% to 37%. Revenue rose to 16%, marking a second straight quarter of increasing gains.


Racing Past New Buy Point
-------------------------


On June 13, Ferrari cleared a 141.66 buy point in a flat base, which is part of a longer base-on-base formation. As you like to see on the day of a breakout, the [relative strength line hit a new high](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/).


Ferrari closed the week at 148.88, just a tad above the 141.66 to 148.74 buy zone. While that means the stock is technically extended, see if it eases back into buy range in moderate volume.



Taking a look at Ferrari's fellow car stocks, GM, Ford and Toyota are all setting up new bases. Fiat Chrysler is also working on a new [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), but is trading below its 10-week moving average.


General Motors has been showing technical strength, and managed to bounce back into positive territory on Friday in a relatively volatile session. The stock gapped up to a nearly 13% gain on May 31 in massive volume. The move came as Japan's [Softbank Vision Fund invested $2.25 billion in GM Cruise](https://www.investors.com/news/gm-softbank-investment-cruise-self-driving-cars/), General Motors' driverless car company. GM's stock is now 4% below a 45.62 entry.

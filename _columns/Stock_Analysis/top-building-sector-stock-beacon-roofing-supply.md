The building sector is showing strength, and that may give **Beacon Roofing Supply** ([BECN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BECN)) the boost it needs to punch through its recent ceiling of resistance and break out.


Ten building-related stocks made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-fund-buys-portfolios-cemented-with-u-s-concrete-ulta-beauty/), indicating strong institutional demand for companies like **Universal Forest Products** ([UFPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UFPI)), which was featured in Tuesday's [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-building-sector-stocks-ufpi-us-concrete/), as well as **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) and **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)). Plus, building ranks No. 5 among the 33 sectors IBD tracks.


That bodes well for related suppliers and retailers like Beacon Roofing, **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Tile Shop** ([TTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTS)), which broke out Wednesday after being [highlighted by IBD](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/home-depot-rival-the-tile-shop-raises-outlook-nears-new-buy-zone/) last week.


Raising The Roof
----------------


After several quarters of negative earnings growth, Beacon has rebounded, posting average EPS growth of 76% over the last three quarters, including a 114% spike in its latest report on May 2.


Over the last three quarters, revenue gains have risen from 8% to 64% and then to 99%.


With a 98 Composite Rating and an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, Beacon holds the No. 1 ranking within the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products industry group, ahead of Lowe's and Tile Shop. Home Depot ranks No. 8.


Beacon Roofing Supply operates 369 branches throughout 46 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada.


The Virginia-based company has made three acquisitions recently, including Woodfeathers, a distributor of primarily residential roofing and related products headquartered in Portland, Ore. More buyouts may be on the way, as CEO Paul Isabella has said "the acquisition pipeline is more robust than ever."


Testing Ceiling Of Resistance
-----------------------------


Beacon Roofing is working on a flat base as part of a first-stage base-on-base formation.


The stock has consistently received support at the 10-week line within the pattern, and its Relative Price Strength line has entered new high ground ahead of a possible breakout past the 45.82 entry.


During the week ended May 20, Beacon saw a huge spike in volume when it announced a secondary offering of 8.5 million shares. The stock dipped lower during the week, but it bounced back to close right around the 10-week moving average.


Look for the Beacon Roofing to clear the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal, and watch the general market to see if the current uptrend regains strength.

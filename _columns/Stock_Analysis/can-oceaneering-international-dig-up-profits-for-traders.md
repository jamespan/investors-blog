While oil and gas drillers on land have gotten most of the attention recently — particularly those drilling in shale formations — there's also been a lot of action under the ocean.

  

And **Oceaneering International** ([OII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OII)) is one of the key players in offshore drilling. The stock was featured in a recent [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/103113-677437-oceaneering-international-eyes-offshore-oil-market.htm). They offer a variety of products and services, like diving and vessel support.

  

But they're probably best known for their remotely operated vehicles — also called ROVs. Those are large, unmanned robots that are tethered to a ship and controlled by people onboard. They can be used to take pictures or to move and place items as deep as two miles below the ocean's surface.

  

Oceaneering had 302 ROVs in their fleet at the end of September, up from 285 a year earlier. And they expect to add 30 to 35 next year.

  

They're a major player in that niche of the business. Analysts note they won 17 of 20 contracts on new floating rigs.

  

They also estimate oil drillers will increase their spending on ROVs about 80% between 2013and 2017. In all, they expect that spending to total nearly $10 billion.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Last week Oceaneering weighed in with their third-quarter results. 

  

• Sales growth was up 16% year over year, though you'll notice the pace of growth has slowed since last quarter. So watch to see if that can improve. • Earnings growth has also cooled and stood at 23% last quarter. 

  

• Looking ahead, analysts expect earnings to climb 28% this year and 19% next year. Stock Checkup [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-oceaneering-intl-inc-oii.aspx) shows Oceaneering carries a 96 Composite Rating, which ties it with **Matrix Service** ([MTRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTRX)) for the No.1 spot in its Oil & Gas-Field Services industry group.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 63 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Oceaneering formed a flat base, broke out and climbed a little then pulled back and carved out a cup-with-handle base.

  

Because this second base formed within 20% of the buy point in the previous base, the pattern is called a base-on-base.

  

And since they're so close together, the entire pattern is counted as a single base in the stock's base count.

  

The 84.74 ideal buy point for that pattern is the same as the buy point in the most recent base. You can calculate it by adding 10 cents to the peak in the handle.

  

Oceaneering broke out past that buy point in mid-Oct., hit a new high, then slipped back. As of early Tues. a.m. it's within about 2% of that ideal buy point.

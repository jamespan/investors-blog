While fears of identity theft fill the headlines around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, cyber attacks are a constant concern — and a growing source of demand — for **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).


Since its IPO in 2012, Palo Alto has continued to grow rapidly, outpacing fellow cybersecurity stocks such as **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)).


Palo Alto's next-generation WildFire firewall has also been taking market share from tech giant **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)).


![Markup_PANW](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Markup_PANW.jpg)After reporting another earnings beat on Nov. 23, CEO Mark McLaughlin said "we continue to beat Cisco handily quarter after quarter as we've done this quarter."


**Key Numbers**


Palo Alto has topped analyst expectations for six consecutive quarters, and has delivered triple-digit earnings growth in each of the last three reports.


Sales growth has come in above 50% for the last six quarters.


For fiscal 2016, analysts expect earnings to rise 106%, followed by a 51% rise in fiscal 2017.


Palo Alto's 74% annual EPS growth rate has attracted the attention of professional investors and the number of funds with a position in the stock has been rising in recent quarters.


Also, four typically better-performing funds have reported a position in Palo Alto, including Fidelity Contrafund and T Rowe Price New Horizons .


That's helped give the Silicon Valley-based firm a 96 Composite Rating and the No. 1 ranking within the Computer Software-Security industry group.


**Chart Analysis**


After breaking out of a double bottom pattern in May 2014, Palo Alto gained as much as 176% over the next year, finding consistent support at the 10-week line.


But then the stock started showing more volatile action this summer and has continued to work on a rather sloppy, second-stage consolidation.


The stock got a boost from latest earnings report, lifting the stock to a nearly 9% gain last week, on volume 51% higher than normal.


See if Palo Alto Networks can clear a 189.82 entry on volume at least 40% above average.

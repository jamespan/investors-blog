No one knows what all the ramifications of the coronavirus stock market crash will be. But accelerating use of online meetings, opportunities to work from home, and even streaming services like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are driving demand for **Cogent Communications** ([CCOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCOI)).




Based in Washington, D.C., Cogent is a global internet service provider, or ISP.


According to the company, Cogent ranks as one of the top five internet backbone networks in the world.


Cogent's network stretches across more than 205 markets throughout 45 countries in North America, Europe and Asia. The ISP owns and operates 54 data centers in North America and Europe.

Coronavirus Scare: Social Distancing Goes Viral
-----------------------------------------------


Fears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered the cancellation of major sporting events, business conferences, and virtually all venues where large numbers of people gather. Even the Big Three automakers — **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), and **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) — have temporarily shuttered factories.


As the new reality of "social distancing" tries to curb growth of the coronavirus, Cogent is attempting to meet the increasing demand on its networks.


Companies like [online meeting leader](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/zoom-stock-ipo-leads-coronavirus-stock-market/) **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) are benefiting from that trend. And Cogent has also become one of the top stocks to watch in what has become the coronavirus stock market.


Viewed on the weekly chart, the [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for Cogent stock and Zoom stock have bolted sharply higher, a sign of exceptional market leadership. Cogent has earned a spot on [IBD Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/), while Zoom is featured on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


Will Coronavirus Keep Lifting Cogent Stock?
-------------------------------------------


The sudden and sharp demand for online meeting leaders like Zoom and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix is unmistakable. The question now is, how enduring will this shift be?


Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the potential for online services in general — and for Netflix, Amazon and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), in particular — were well known.


Demand for Cogent stock among [institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) has also been strong. Cogent sports a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-key-to-investment-success/) and four quarters of rising fund ownership. The company also pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.1% on an annualized basis.


With the coronavirus correction taking hold and Cogent stock extended, now is certainly not an ideal time to buy. But favorable trends and strong institutional sponsorship put Cogent among the top stocks to watch.


On Friday, Cogent stock in pulled back over 6% in heavy volume. It came off its lows to end the session right around its 10-week line.

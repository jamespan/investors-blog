When will corporate America return to the office? It's a particularly important question to real estate and investment management leader **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)). While work-at-home trends have certainly impacted the real estate and work space markets, JLL stock is trying to close the deal on a new breakout to an all-time high.




On Oct. 7, JLL will hold a public webinar to offer insights on the U.S. office market recovery in the second half of 2021. The company believes the Delta variant has [delayed but not derailed a recovery in the office space market](https://www.us.jll.com/en/newsroom/delta-delays-re-entry-decisions--not-derailing-office-recovery).


JLL acknowledges that the Delta variant has pushed back decisions and added near-term uncertainty. But it believes the office market will recover and remain a critical part of the workplace, and of investment portfolios.


Based in Chicago, JLL is a world leader in real estate services with operations in over 80 countries. The company has a global workforce of nearly 93,000 people.


JLL buys, builds, occupies and invests in a variety of assets including industrial, commercial, retail, residential and hotel real estate. From tech startups to Fortune 500 firms, clients span industries including [banking](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansachs/), [energy](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/), health care, law, life sciences, manufacturing and [technology](https://www.investors.com/technology/).

Office Space Recovery Boosts JLL And Real Estate Industry Peers
---------------------------------------------------------------


JLL joins office space and industry peers **CBRE Group** ([CBRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBRE)) and **Landmark Infrastructure** ([LMRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMRK)) in the real estate development and operations group. At No. 16, the group ranks within the Top 20 of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), JLL stock ties CBRE stock. The rating shows both companies are outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of [key stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


JLL posted 492% earnings growth last quarter and analysts expect the company to generate a 64% gain for the year.


Indicating [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-i-in-can-slim-make-sure-top-fund-managers-are-backing-your-stock-picks/), JLL and CBRE both made the latest monthly list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-on-tech-stocks-msft-shop-fb-googl-stock/).

JLL Stock Looks To Close Deal On Fresh Breakout
-----------------------------------------------


After breaking out in July, CBRE stock is now extended. JLL stock is looking to ride an office space rebound into a fresh [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) of its own.


JLL stock is showing a 254.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). In a sign of market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is at a new high ahead of the potential breakout, earning a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/).


On Friday, JLL stock broke out and closed the week 2% above the initial buy point.


The action in CBRE and its own RS line further confirm that strength in both of these office space leaders. But keep in mind that current market trends make it difficult for stocks to launch sustained climbs.

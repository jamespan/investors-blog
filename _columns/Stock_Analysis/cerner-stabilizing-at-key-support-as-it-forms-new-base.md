**Cerner** ([CERN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CERN)) has been in a steady uptrend since breaking out in November, although now it is forming a new base. 

  

The stock has held up well in this market correction. So far, it corrected 9% from its May 19 peak. By comparison, the Nasdaq fell as much as 10% from its May 2 high.

  

Cerner has pulled back to its 10-week moving average, where it seems to be finding support 1. Volume has been mostly tame 2.

  

With the stock nearly five weeks into its correction, Cerner can be considered to be forming a flat base. Tight price action in the consolidation is encouraging.

  

Back in May, the stock broke out of a three-weeks-tight pattern 3. The market was in a correction at the time, and Cerner's a good example of why buying during corrections can be dangerous.

  

After small gains, the stock fell more than 7% below the three-weeks-tight buy point. So it would have forced those who bought at that time to sell shares.

  

Being shaken out of a position is never fun, but following selling rules once a stock falls 7% or 8% below your buy point is one of the best ways to protect your portfolio.

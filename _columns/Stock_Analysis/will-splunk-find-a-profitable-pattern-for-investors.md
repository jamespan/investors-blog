Today we're going to look at **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)), which was featured in the Jan. 30 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/012914-688070-splunk-crunches-big-data-as-enterprise-software-provider.htm).

  

The firm makes software that collects vast swaths of data from many sources, meshes the information with other data sets, then organizes and analyses the patterns.

  

Analysts say Splunk has a very innovative product lineup and demand is growing robustly.

  

The company has made a name for itself helping clients' information technology and security departments — two areas ripe for ongoing investment — predict service degradation problems before they happen. That saves time and money, and prevents disruptions to productivity.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth has been up and down in past quarters. Last quarter, earnings totaled a penny a share vs. a 1-cent loss a year earlier. 

  

• Sales growth has been more steady, ranging from 50% to 54% the past four quarters. 

  

• Analysts think the company lost a penny a share in the 2014 fiscal year, which ended in Jan. And they predict the firm will earn 13 cents a share in fiscal 2015. 

  

• Splunk is scheduled to post its latest results Feb. 24, so keep an eye out for those. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-splunk-inc-splk.aspx) shows that the firm's spotty earnings track record is weighing on its EPS Rating.

  

And it's also a drag on its Composite Rating, which is only 73.

  

On a more positive note, the stock is a member of the Computer Software-Database group, which is ranked No. 28 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith weekly chart on this page, the stock broke out of a third-stage, flat base last month. Late-stage bases like that have a greater risk of failing.

  

Splunk climbed a little, then pulled back to the 10-week moving average line, where it seems to be finding support.

  

With a bounce up from a moving average line the best time to buy is as close the line as possible once a stock starts to climb on heavy volume.

  

But with the broader market in a correction, buying stocks can be risky. So for now this may just be one to keep on your watch list.

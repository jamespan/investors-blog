When the financial crisis hit a few years ago, private equity fund manager **Blackstone Group** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) had a portfolio of debt-laden leveraged buyouts. And that dragged down performance.

  

But, as this May 2 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/050113-654275-blackstone-group-grows-with-stocks-real-estate.htm) noted, Blackstone kept raising money from its institutional investors and wisely put that money to work in real estate and other markets beyond its traditional leveraged buyouts of companies.

  

And now nearly 35% of the company's $218 billion under management comes from new products, new strategies and new regions.

  

The company has benefited from the Fed's low interest rates and gains in stocks, real estate and credit markets.

  

And the amount of assets they manage has also risen, climbing 15% last year.

  

Analysts say that Blackstone is also poised to harvest assets from its huge real estate portfolio, which has holdings in hotels, offices commercial real estate and houses.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings jumped 164% last quarter.

  

• Sales grew 31% last quarter.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts expect earnings to climb a hefty 456% this year, but just 20% the following year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-blackstone-group-lp-bx.aspx) shows Blackstone's 96 Composite Rating is the eighth highest in its Finance-Investment Management industry group.

  

**Fortress Investment Group** ([FIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIG)) carries the group's highest rating.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Blackstone's shares suffered during the financial crisis a few years ago. Since then the stock has worked its way back.

  

More recently, as the MarketSmith daily chart above shows, in early Jan. Blackstone broke out of a long cup-with-handle base and began to climb. That base began back in Feb. 2012 and it's too long to show completely on this daily chart. But you can see the handle portion of it.

  

After that breakout it scored some nice gains. Then last month it paused and pulled back to the 50-day moving average line, where it found support.

  

When you're buying on a rebound up from the 50-day line, the ideal time to buy is as close to that benchmark line as possible once you see heavy volume start to kick in.

  

And although Blackstone is now too far extended to get into safely, with its earnings growth prospects it may be worth a spot on your watch list.

  

Also remember that many stocks that have big price climbs will give investors multiple chances to get on board during their price runs.

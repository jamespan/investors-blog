 With explosive top and bottom line growth in recent quarters and a 6.1% dividend, New York-based **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) may be one to add to your Wall Street watch list as we wait to see how market holds up.
After a 2-1/2 year slump in both earnings and sales, Apollo has come back with a vengeance, averaging 1,534% EPS growth over the last three quarters. Revenue gains have accelerated from 88% to 254% during the same time.


The company's 53.8% annual pre-tax profit margin and 54.3% return on equity are two key ingredients driving that growth.


Institutional investors have taken note, as reflected in the stock's A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


On the downside, Apollo carries a heavy 256% debt-to-equity ratio, which could become costly if interest rates rise significantly.


Also note that analyst earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 were recently revised lower to 8% and 21%, respectively.


No. 1 Rank In Industry
----------------------


As self-described "contrarian, value-oriented investors in private equity, credit and real estate," Apollo Global Management earns the top rank within the Finance-Investment Management group, ahead of **Financial Engines** ([FNGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGN)), **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), **Stellus Capital Investment** ([SCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCM)) and **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)).


The group itself ranks just No. 101 out of 197 industries.


Follow The Funds – And Earnings
-------------------------------


In a weekly chart, you can easily see the correlation between the rise in Apollo's earnings and the rise in its share price.


The stock has been moving higher since February of last year as investors suspected – correctly – that the company's fundamentals were on the verge of a rebound.


Apollo is now working on a flat base with a 24.10 buy point.



It's technically considered a first-stage formation since the stock undercut a prior low back in October. But it clipped the old bottom by mere pennies – not exactly the clean break often seen when a stock [resets its base count](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-how-to-count-bases).


Although Apollo sold off in volume for two weeks to start the current pattern, it found support at the 10-week line and has shown accumulation and tight trading in the right side of the base.


On a rough day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Apollo Global Management showed resilience, slipping only fractionally as its Relative Strength line moved higher, a sign it was outperforming the general market. Volume was up sharply for the day, but the stock didn't give up much ground and remained above its 10-day line at the close.


While Apollo has been showing technical and fundamental strength, keep in mind that it is difficult for any stock to move higher when the indexes are facing increasing selling pressure. Breakouts in this type of environment are more prone to failure.

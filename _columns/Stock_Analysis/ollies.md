While it's been a trying week for **TJX Companies** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), fellow discount retailer **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) has managed to hold its ground and trade at the upper end of a buy zone.


Since its July 2015 IPO, Ollie's has proved to be a favorite among mutual fund managers, making several appearances on IBD's monthly list of [new buys by top-performing funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-mutual-funds-put-ollies-and-five-below-on-their-shopping-lists/). The stock has also seen three straight quarters of rising fund ownership, and highly rated **Fidelity Contrafund** ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) owns approximately 3.5% of shares.


Potential To Expand
-------------------


Founded in 1982, Ollie's Bargain Outlet offers "good stuff cheap" in its 218 "semi-lovely" stores across 19 states. The company says it has the potential to expand to 950 locations throughout the country.


A 97 [Composite Rating](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771) earns the stock the No. 2 spot within the discount retailers industry group, behind Five Below and ahead of **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), Dollar General and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).


Ollie's three-year EPS growth rate is a strong 59%, while sales have grown at an 18% annual clip during the same period. The company is set to release fiscal Q2 numbers on Aug. 31.


Rising Demand
-------------


After clearing a 26.65 [double-bottom](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2) entry last month, Ollie's pulled back but found support at the 10-week line.



The stock has a history of fairly wide daily price swings, so any investor buying the stock should be ready for some patience-testing volatility.


Ollie's closed lower for two days, then bounced back into a 26.65-27.98 buy zone on Wednesday and added to those gains in rising volume on Thursday.


Daily trading has generally been below average recently, but the Up/Down Volume Ratio has improved from 0.7 earlier in the week to 1.3, pointing to increasing demand for shares.

There’s no mystery to what **Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) is all about. The Pennsylvania-based retailer of closeouts and excess inventory offers “good stuff cheap” in its 203 self-described “semi-lovely” stores in 16 states.


Ollie’s opened its first location in 1982 and went public last July. While it remains thinly traded and current market conditions make it hard for any stock to climb higher right now, Ollie’s shares certain traits with past IPO stocks that went on to make solid gains.


Leading Stock In Rising Industry Group
--------------------------------------


First, the stock’s 97 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot among its peers within the discount retailers industry group, behind **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and ahead of **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).


Discounters tend to do well in a weak economy. And with fears of a recession starting to emerge, the group’s ranking has jumped to No. 47, up from No. 165 three months ago.


Strong Demand Among Fund Managers
---------------------------------


Another plus for Ollie’s Bargain Outlet is strong demand for the stock among mutual fund managers and other large investors. That’s reflected in the B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership since Ollie’s went public last year.


Also, two typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock: Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Wasatch Micro Cap (WMICX).


Profitable Track Record
-----------------------


A third trait that Ollie’s shares with top IPO stocks is a track record of solid earnings growth, including EPS gains of 38% to 40% over the last three quarters.


Although sales growth slowed to 16% in its latest reported quarter, last month the company raised full-year guidance for fiscal 2015, which ended Jan. 30. Ollie’s expects net sales to increase 19% to $760 million, with comparable store sales growth of approximately 5.5%. The retailer is expected to report earnings in early April.


Working On First Post-IPO Base
------------------------------


Ollie’s Bargain Outlet’s stock got off to a rough start after going public, but it’s now working on the right side of its first base.

Although it has pulled back this week along with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, a prior streak of six consecutive up weeks, mostly in heavy volume, was a sign of buying by institutional investors.


The rising Relative Strength line is another sign of market leadership.


So while its prudent to be cautious about buying any stock at the moment, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet may be one IPO stock watch. See if the general market can establish a more stable uptrend and if Ollie’s can break past its 23.09 buy point in heavy volume.

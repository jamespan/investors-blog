Boosted by an average earnings beat of 17% over the last four quarters, **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) has more than doubled in price since its June 2014 IPO. But it's been a bumpy ride for investors and as the stock tries to break out, it's also facing a long-term point of resistance.


No. 1 Among Cloud Network Stocks
--------------------------------


As a provider of networking software and hardware for cloud service providers and next-generation data centers, Arista Networks holds the No. 1 rank among computer networking stocks, followed by **Brocade** ([BRCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCD)) and **Silicom** ([SILC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SILC)).


Fellow 2014 IPO **Zayo** ([ZAYO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZAYO)) and tech giant **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) are also among the industry's top five leaders.


Arista's sales growth has been strong and steady, ranging from 33% to 53% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has ranged from 36% to 100% during the same period.


The Silicon Valley-based firm sports a strong 26% return on equity and 27.8% annual pretax profit margin.


Mutual fund managers have taken note, driving eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, Arista Networks made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/new-stock-buys-of-top-mutual-funds-netflix-zions-bancorp-chip-stocks/).


Is Resistance Futile Or Fierce?
-------------------------------


On Monday, Arista just cleared an 87.72 entry in an early-stage flat base, as its Relative Strength line headed into new high ground. Volume came in 79% above average.


A 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio and B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating confirm institutional demand further confirm demand for the stock.



But by looking to the left on a weekly chart, you can see that Arista Networks is now approaching an old area of resistance around 88, which it failed to clear in June and July of last year.


On Monday, Arista reached a high of 88.88 before edging lower to close just above the buy point.


See if the stock can break out decisively in heavy volume and clear its prior ceiling of resistance, turning it into a floor of support from which to launch a new climb.

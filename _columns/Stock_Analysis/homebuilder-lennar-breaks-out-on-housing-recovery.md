Top-rated homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) is trying to break out as the housing market shows continued signs of recovery.That's welcome news after the lackluster, choppy performance in recent years of most homebuilder stocks, including **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Ryland Group** ([RYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYL)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and newer IPOs **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) and **New Home Company** ([NWHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NWHM)).


Miami-based Lennar hopes to get an additional boost by monetizing its interest in a trio of California real estate communities managed by [Five Point Holdings](http://news.investors.com/business/070815-760710-lennar-investment-five-point-could-go-public.htm), which is reported to be in the process of filing for an IPO.


Through an agreement between the two companies, Lennar could exchange its interest in Five Point subsidiaries for 30% to 40% of Five Point's common stock when it goes public.


**Key Fundamentals**


While earnings growth slowed in Q2, the 30% rise easily beat analyst estimates. The company also beat on revenue, showing a jump from 21% to 32%.


For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 16%, followed by a 17% gain in 2016.


While homebuilder stocks like Lennar have shown new signs of life, the industry group is ranked just No. 96 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. See if that improves.


Overall, Lennar earns a 95 Composite Rating, and its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio point to institutional demand for the stock.


**Chart Analysis**


Lennar [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) last summer when it undercut the low in its prior pattern. It's now working on a cup-with-handle as part of a first-stage base-on-base formation.


In the right side of the pattern, Lennar showed tight weekly closes as it climbed back above its 10-week line, then shot higher after reporting earnings on Jun. 24. Volume for the week spiked — a healthy sign that large investors were picking up shares.


The buy point is 52.60, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.


On Tuesday, Lennar rose over 3% to close above that price on volume 62% above average. But on Wednesday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 headed lower, Lennar fell back below the buy point.


On Thursday morning, the stock moved back above the entry and was trading within the 52.60 — 55.23 buying range.

Having already journeyed well beyond their 2020 [coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) lows, are travel stocks like **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) ready to take flight in 2022? Joining **Hilton Worldwide** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)), **Wyndham Hotels & Resorts** ([WH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WH)) and **Hyatt Hotels** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)), Marriott is packing its bags for a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).




Marriott, Hilton and the others all hail from the same lodging industry group, which ranks No. 26 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. The strong group ranking shows how forward-looking Wall Street has an eye out for blue skies and reduced travel restrictions on the horizon.


The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) for the group leaders reflects that. With a 92 Composite Rating, Marriott trails Hilton (98 rating) and Wyndham (95). Hilton and Wyndham secure a spot among the top tier of companies in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) with a 95 or higher Composite Rating.


But Marriott earns a still solid 92 rating, meaning it is outpacing 92% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).

Marriott Looks To Unpack 1,539% Earnings Growth
-----------------------------------------------


Based in Maryland, Marriott has a portfolio of more than 7,900 properties under 30 brands. Spanning 138 countries and territories, it operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts around the world.


After several quarters of slowing earnings growth as the pandemic hit, Marriott came back in Q3 with a 662% increase to 99 cents a share. With earnings due on Feb. 18, analysts expect the company to post 750% EPS growth in Q4 and a 1,539% spike for the full year.


Showing why it leads among lodging and travel stocks, Hilton locked in a 1,200% EPS spike in Q3. For its next report on Feb. 17, analysts call for 900% increase in Q4 and a 2,100% gain for the full year.


Sales growth for both companies has also impressed. In the last two quarters, Marriott has generated sales growth of 75% (Q3) and 115% (Q2). Hilton has booked similar numbers, with a revenue gain of 136% in the second quarter, followed by an 87% gain in Q3.


Top Travel Stocks Explore New Buy Zones
---------------------------------------


Fewer travel restrictions for both business and pleasure would obviously bode well for stocks like Marriott and Hilton. And it shows in their [stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


Marriott is building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 171.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). As you like to see, volume in the pullback within the handle has been light. That shows mutual funds and other large investors are not selling aggressively.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has fallen off the highs it hit in February 2021, but has started to perk up. On Thursday, Marriott gave back its early gains in light volume. On Friday, it slipped1% but came off its lows to close at its 21-day line and 5% shy of a breakout.


Hilton broke out of a cup with handle on Dec. 22. After rising to a [new high](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/) on Jan. 4, the stock pulled back as the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) ran into selling pressure. Hilton is below its earlier [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) but has found support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


With earnings due next month for both companies, see if Marriott and Hilton can deliver on their big earnings estimates â€” and if the stock market can keep building on its rebound.

When the general market sells off, keep an eye on stocks showing resilience in the face of that pressure since they're the ones that could take off when a stronger rally returns. Energy drink giant **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) so far fits that bill.









 
 
 On Tuesday, Monster reported Q2 earnings, showing rising growth for both earnings (18%) and sales (10%). The California-based company topped analyst estimates for sales, but missed on EPS by a penny, which the company said was [due to production shortages with its coffee and protein drinks](https://www.investors.com/news/monster-beverage-stock-is-in-a-buy-zone-ahead-of-earnings/).
The outlook for the rest of the year remains strong, with several new products in the pipeline for release this year.


Plus, boosted by its global distribution partnership with **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), Monster's international sales showed strong results for the second quarter and look well-positioned for continued growth in the second half of the year.


While unfavorable currency exchange rates have affected quarterly net sales, Monster has been gaining market share across Europe, South America and Asia, including in Great Britain, Australia, Brazil and South Korea.


Leading Stock In Highly Ranked Group
------------------------------------


With a 97 Composite Rating, Monster Beverage holds the No. 3 slot within the No. 13-ranked nonalcoholic beverage group. **National Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)) earns top billing.


Institutional demand for Monster is reflected in its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.2 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Re-Energizing New Run?
----------------------


Monster first cleared a 52.51 buy point in a cup with handle during the week ended July 28. It continued to test that entry in the days that followed, then fell more sharply below it on Wednesday.


But Monster showed resilience that day by rebounding to close near the top of the price range and above its 50-day line.



The stock also fought off Thursday's decline in the indexes with a 1% rise in heavy volume. On Friday the stock moved back into the 52.51-55.14 buy range with a gain of more than 2%, again in above-average trade.


While Monster's chart action and outlook are both positive, also keep an eye on the major indexes to see if Monday's rebound holds.


On Monday, Monster Beverage gave back much of the morning's gains to close just fractionally higher, ending the day 3% above the buy point.

Although natural gas prices may be low **Cabot Oil and Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)) has location on its side.

  

As a May 24 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/052313-657342-cabot-oil-range-resources-big-in-marcellus.htm) noted, it operates in one of the most prolific shale gas regions in the U.S., the Marcellus formation in northeast Pennsylvania. In fact it's secured 200,000 acres in the "sweet spot" of Susquehanna County in that state.

  

The price of gas is important, because if it drops too low, it's not worth it for companies to extract it.

  

And Cabot owns one of the lowest-cost gas plays in the U.S. That means it can make money on its output even when gas prices drop to as low as $1.50 to $2 per million cubic feet. Prices are now around $4.

  

Also, unlike some of its rivals, cash flow isn't a problem.

  

In fact analysts estimate Cabot will have a cash flow surplus of $60 million in 2013 and at least $300 million in 2014, if gas prices are in the $3.60 to $4 range.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

So let's see how that shakes out in terms of the company's fundamentals:

  

• Sales grew 37% last quarter.

  

• Earnings growth has been accelerating, coming in at 86% last quarter.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts predict earnings will climb 129% this year and 72% next year.

  

• Remember that good cash flow we mentioned earlier? That's reflected in Cabot's cash flow, which was $2.84 cents a share last year.

  

• When you're sizing up cash flow you like to see it be at least 20% higher than the earnings per share during the most recent fiscal year.

  

• Cabot more than meets that threshold. Its cash flow was more than four times its earnings last year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cabot-oil-and-gas-corp-cog.aspx) shows Cabot's Composite Rating is the third highest among the 102 stocks in its industry group. Only **Bonanza Creek Energy** ([BCEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCEI)) and **EPL Oil and Gas** ([EPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPL)) have higher ratings.

  

And the industry group itself is ranked No. 119 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On the MarketSmith daily chart above you'll notice that Cabot broke out of a flat base May 20.

  

But volume was only about 29% higher than normal and you like to see volume that's at least 40% above average on a breakout.

  

The stock went on to hit a new high, but as of early Tues. a.m. had fallen back below the ideal buy point in its recent base.

  

So watch to see if it can find its footing and resume its climb. Or if it continues to pull back and can find support at the 50-day moving average line.

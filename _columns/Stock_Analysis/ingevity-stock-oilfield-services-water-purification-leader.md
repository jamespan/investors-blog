Tracing its roots back to 1846, today you'll find products and technology from specialty chemicals maker **Ingevity** ([NGVT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NGVT)) all around you — in your food, water, roads, soap, fabrics, automobiles and more. But should Ingevity stock also be in your investing portfolio?




The company began life as Ellin, Chaflin & Co. in 1846 and later changed its name to the Mead Paper Company. Starting out viewing the byproducts of its papermaking process as an opportunity rather than waste, Ingevity today has evolved into a leading chemical producer whose mission is to help "purify, protect and enhance our world."


With approximately 1,750 employees across 25 locations around the world, Ingevity operates in a wide range of fields, including oilfield services, water purification, engineered polymers, adhesives, textiles, agricultural chemicals and asphalt.


Ingevity stock began trading as a stand-alone company in 2016, after being spun off by **WestRock** ([WRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRK)), formerly known as MeadWestvaco. Last month, Ingevity was [added to the S&P MidCap 400](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ingevity-set-join-p-midcap-215100240.html), replacing Esterline Technologies, which was recently purchased by **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)).

Ingevity Engineers 138% Earnings Growth
---------------------------------------


After a string of quarters showing single-digit sales growth, Ingevity has delivered revenue gains ranging from 18% to 21% over the last three reports. Earnings growth has been even stronger, ranging from 32% to 138% over the last six quarters. Analysts are looking for a 22% rise in EPS when Ingevity reports after the market close on May 1.


With a 20.6% annual pretax profit margin and 58.5% return on equity, Ingevity earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE as a whole. Note, however, that the South Carolina company also carries a heavy debt load, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 219%.


Ingevity holds the No. 2 slot among specialty chemical stocks with a 94 Composite Rating, behind 2017 [IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure** ([SOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOI)). The group ranks a middling No. 93 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.

New Breakout For Ingevity Stock After 300%-Plus Run?
----------------------------------------------------


Ingevity has been climbing steadily since its post-spinoff IPO in May 2016. From the closing price on the day of its debut until now, the stock has risen well over 300%.


As the general market went into a correction in Q4 of last year, Ingevity stock formed a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) base with a depth of 30%, an acceptable decline during a bear market. While forming that pattern, the stock undercut the low in its prior consolidation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


Ingevity is now working on a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) as part of a first-stage base on base. The [ideal buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 116.37.


Following its Q4 earnings report on Feb. 13, Ingevity stock gapped up to an 11.2% gain to clear the 104.92 buy point. Volume was 336% above average. While the stock soon pulled back to start forming its current cup with handle, notice how the stock [found support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) around the 104.92 buy point and the 50-day line.


Another positive sign was how the drop within the cup with handle (16%) was much shallower than the prior base's 30% decline. This could mean the stock is building stepping-stones on its way to an even higher climb.


As **iRobot** ([IRBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRBT)) showed this week, it can be [risky to buy a stock just before earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/irobot-stock-buy-point-flat-base/). But if Ingevity reports strong numbers and jumps past the entry in heavy volume, it could offer a lower risk buying opportunity.


On Thursday, Ingevity erased most of the day's earlier decline, and managed to close right at its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/). On Friday, the stock successfully retested its 50-day line and temporarily cleared the buy point. Ingevity closed the day with a 2.3% gain, but in light volume and below the entry.

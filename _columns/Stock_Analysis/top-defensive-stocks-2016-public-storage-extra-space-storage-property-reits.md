While it's risky to buy any stock during a market correction, savvy investors closely track stocks showing resilience and bucking the downtrend. One such name is **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates over 2,250 self-storage facilities in 38 states and nearly 200 locations in Europe.


**Institutional Demand For REIT Stocks**  

Mutual funds have been shifting money into Public Storage, **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)), **CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)), **National Storage Affiliates Trust** ([NSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSA)) and other rivals in recent months, lifting the Finance-Property REIT industry group from No. 66 three months ago to No. 12 today.


![011916_ISA_PSA](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/011916_ISA_PSA.jpg)Demand for shares in the property REITs is also reflected in IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing stock funds](http://news.investors.com/PDF/mutbuys_010816.pdf).


In Q4, 60 top funds picked up $282 million worth of shares in Public Storage, topping five other property REITs that also made the list, including Extra Space Storage (42 funds, $107 million in shares), **Equity Lifestyle Properties** ([ELS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELS)) (14 funds, $39 million) and Store Capital (11 funds, $7.1 million).


**Key Numbers**


While Public Storage hasn't been posting exceptionally strong numbers in recent quarters, it has shown the steady and consistent growth that fund managers like to see, especially in an uncertain, rocky market. Plus, the storage business generally holds up better than many other industries in a weak economy.


Funds from operations (FFO) growth — the equivalent of earnings-per-share for REITs — has ranged from 6% to 12% over the last eight quarters, while revenue gains have come in between 8% and 11% during the same period. Public Storage is expected to report Q4 numbers on Feb. 7.


The Glendale, CA-based firm also pays a dividend currently yielding 2.7% and earns a solid 98 Composite Rating.


**Chart Analysis**


Several [telltale clues](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/how-to-find-stocks-to-watch-during-market-downturns-ibd-investing-show-excerpt/) reveal how well a stock is holding up in a down market.


One is the trajectory of the Relative Strength line. For Public Storage, that key line has continued to trend higher despite the stock market sell-off that kicked off the new year. That shows the stock is outperforming the price action of the S&P 500, which serves as a benchmark for the general market.


Another sign of strength for Public Storage is the tight trading and support at the 10-week line. The stock recently posted five straight weeks of very tight closes, indicating that institutional investors were not dumping shares — and were likely quietly adding to their positions — as the rest of the market sold off.


If that behavior continues, it may mean that Public Storage and fellow property REITs will be among the top defensive stocks to watch in 2016.

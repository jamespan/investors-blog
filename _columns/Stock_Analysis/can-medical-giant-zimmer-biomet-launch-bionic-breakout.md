**Zimmer Biomet** ([ZBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBH)) is closing in on a new buy zone, as its Medical-Products industry group rises in the rankings, from No. 124 six weeks ago to No. 44 today.


The maker of orthopedic reconstructive products has a 98 Composite Rating, earning it a spot among the industry leaders such as **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)), **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) and **Vascular Solutions** ([VASC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VASC)).  


Mega Merger Creates Global Giant
--------------------------------


Zimmer Biomet was born from last year’s $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet, creating a global leader in musculoskeletal health care doing business in over 100 countries.


The stock has a market cap of over $23 billion and is a member of the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/despite-market-drop-a-few-big-cap-stocks-set-up/).


Zimmer Biomet develops products to treat disorders and injuries of the bones, joints and supporting soft tissues. Approximately 36% of revenue, which hit $6 billion in 2015, comes from knee-related treatments, with another 25% generated by hip replacements. Products and systems related to surgical, sports medicine, extremities and trauma make up 21% of sales.


In April, Zimmer Biomet announced it would acquire Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings. 


Earnings growth has risen in each of the last four reports, jumping from -2% to 30% during that period. Sales have increased by 58% to 68% over the last three quarters. The company beat estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.


For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 16%, followed by a 10% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher. 


Rising Estimates Drive Rising RS Line
-------------------------------------


Zimmer Biomet is working on a long, 63-week cup-with-handle with a 117.87 entry.

Also note how the 10-week moving average has climbed back above the 40-week line, and how the stock showed tight closes in the prior four weeks.


Look for the stock to clear the buy point in heavy volume, but also keep an eye on the general market, which has faced selling pressure in recent weeks.

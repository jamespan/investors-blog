Just as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has profited from CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive move to mobile beginning in 2012, creative software and marketing analytics leader **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is benefitting from its shift to a business model based on "software as a service" (SaaS) and cloud computing.


Also like Facebook -- which has spent heavily on acquisitions including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR -- Adobe has used buyouts of Omniture, Fotolia and others to expand market share and functionality for its three core offerings: Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Marketing Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud.

The latest move came Tuesday, when Adobe announced the acquisition of [audience engagement firm Livefyre](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-systems-acquires-livefyre-to-strengthen-marketing-cloud/). Livefyre will be incorporated into the Adobe Experience Manager, allowing marketers to better engage customers by bringing together content from **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms.


Adobe’s focus on the cloud and SaaS has sparked a turnaround in its fundamentals, with earnings growth averaging 67% over the last three quarters, whiles sales have risen 21% to 25% during the same period.


Floating Near New Buy Point
---------------------------


After resetting its base count in February, Adobe tried to break out March 18 after reporting earnings, gapping up in volume 198% above average.


But the stock gave back much of those gains the same day, and soon retreated to begin forming its current flat base, as part of a base-on-base formation.


Trading has been tight, with good support along the 10-week moving average. Also note how the relative strength line is approaching new-high ground as the stock tries to close in on the 98.10 entry.


See if Adobe can clear the buy point on volume at least 40% higher than normal. And make sure you have a defensive plan in place since several breakouts have stumbled or stalled in this market.

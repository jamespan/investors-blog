After reporting earnings and renewing a multiyear contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation ahead of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) has rebounded into buy range. Visa stock has shaken off turbulence in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) and a brief post-earnings drop. Rival **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) looks to build on its own recent breakout.




Last month, [Visa and the U.S. Soccer Federation](https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2023/07/visa-and-us-soccer-announce-multi-year-partnership-extension-ahead-of-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023) renewed a multiyear partnership to remain the exclusive payment services partner for both the women's and men's soccer teams. The deal also provides unique benefits to cardholders through 2028. The extension again ensures at least 50% of Visa's investment going toward soccer programming will be directed to the Women's National Team and women's soccer initiatives.


On June 28, [Visa announced it would acquire Pismo](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.19751.html) for $1 billion in cash. Pismo is a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe.


The deal positions Visa to provide core banking and issuer processing capabilities across debit, prepaid, credit and commercial cards for clients via cloud native APIs. Pismo's platform will also enable Visa to provide support and connectivity for emerging payment rails, like Pix in Brazil, for financial institution clients.


Mega Cap Visa Stock Top Rival Mastercard

Visa, headquartered in San Francisco, is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.


The market capitalization for the financial giant easily tops that of its industry peers, including Mastercard and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)).

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visa | V | 445.2 | 15 | 87 | 91 | 72 | A |

| Discover Financial Services | DFS | 25.5 | -17 | 71 | 68 | 51 | A |


The Finance-Credit Card/Payment group ranks a lowly No. 138 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Aside from **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)), none of the other group leaders earn a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?) above 90.  [Shift4](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/shift4-payments-paypal-partner-sets-up-as-industry-peer-sq-stock-peer-looks-to-cash-in-with-breakout/), profiled in this column on July 21, earns top billing with a 91 rating.


Visa outpaces Mastercard and AmEx with an 87 Composite Rating, showing it's outperforming 87% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


In Q2, Visa posted earnings per share of $2.16, a 9% year-over-year gain. Revenue rose 12% to clear the $8 billion mark at $8.12 billion.


In a sign of demand among large money managers, 68 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares of Visa stock.


Visa Stock Holds Support In Buy Zone As Market Takes Hit
--------------------------------------------------------


While the major indexes fell in heavy volume Wednesday, Visa fared relatively well. Visa stock held support at its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) to close the session in buy range from a 235.57 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). Visa slipped early Thursday, but rebounded as the Nasdaq also bounced off its lows. Visa rebounded to close the week above the 21-day line and still in buy range.


Mastercard has dipped below its buy range, while AXP stock has lost support at its 50-day line. Shift4 Payments also fell below that benchmark.


After reporting earnings late Thursday,  [SQ stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-earnings-q22023/) sank below its 50-day line on Friday. The stock declined nearly 13% in massive volume.

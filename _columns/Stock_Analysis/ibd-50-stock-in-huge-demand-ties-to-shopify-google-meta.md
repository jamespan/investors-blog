Unmistakable Demand
-------------------


Sporting a [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-globale-online-glbe.aspx) of 94 out of a best-possible 99, Global-e Online continues to flash unequivocal signs of demand.


The stock earns the highest-possible A+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/), indicating heavy buying by large investors over the last 13 weeks. It also merits a stellar 2.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), where anything above 1.0 points to demand.


Plus, Global-e Online is riding eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Global-e Online Charging Higher
-------------------------------


After reporting third-quarter earnings on Nov. 20, shares of Global-e blasted nearly 12% higher in a single day. Instead of retreating, it managed to hold that gain and move higher, a clear sign of strong demand.


The stock also found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) earlier this month as it continues to craft a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). The buy point is 57.85.


Although Global-e fell Thursday, it rebounded off early lows and found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). On Friday, the stock held tough to close the week just 2% shy of a breakout.


Partners Meta and Alphabet are also showing strength. Google stock is extended, while Meta popped into buy range from a new base. As Shopify tries to recapture its 10-week line, it may be crafting a new late-stage consolidation.

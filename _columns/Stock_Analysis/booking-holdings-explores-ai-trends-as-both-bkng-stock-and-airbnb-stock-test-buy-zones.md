This is not your grandparents' concierge. **Booking Holdings** ([BKGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKGN)) — the company behind Priceline.com, Kayak and OpenTable — would like to introduce you to [AI Trip Planner](https://ir.bookingholdings.com/news/news-details/2023/Booking.com-Launches-New-AI-Trip-Planner-to-Enhance-Travel-Planning-Experience/default.aspx). As a resurgent travel industry boosts companies like **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) and **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), Booking taps into machine learning and artificial intelligence trends. And that — along with 197% earnings growth — has BKNG stock looking to book a breakout.




AI Trip Planner just launched in beta for select U.S. travelers. It builds on Booking.com's existing machine learning models, which recommend destination and accommodation options to millions of travelers each day. AI Trip Planner is also partially powered by large language model (LLM) technology from OpenAI's ChatGPT API. The combined technology creates a new conversational experience for people to start their trip planning process.


It also takes the trip planning process one step further by providing travelers with a visual list of destinations and properties. Travelers can go back and forth between their chat with the AI Trip Planner and the Booking.com app interface as they explore options for their trip. With just a tap, users can complete a reservation. Since AI Trip Planner is integrated into the accommodation booking experience, users can complete a reservation with just a tap.


Booking Holdings: Big Cap With Big Earnings
-------------------------------------------


Like [Airbnb](https://www.investors.com/research/airbnb-abnb-stock-buy-now/), Booking has a global footprint. Operating in over 220 countries in more than 40 languages, the company has more than 28 million listings of hotels, homes, apartments and other places to stay.


Booking extends beyond Priceline.com, Kayak and OpenTable. It also owns Asia-focused Agoda and Rentalcars.com.


The company posted 197% earnings growth last quarter.  Analysts forecast a 50% EPS increase when Booking next reports on Aug. 3. Wall Streets expects 38% earnings growth for the full year.


The Connecticut-based firm generated $3.78 billion in sales in Q1, a 40% year-over-year rise. Booking Holdings sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. One blemish is the high debt-to-equity ratio of 431%.

BKNG Stock Looks To Book A Room In A Buy Zone
---------------------------------------------


Booking Holdings is working on an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 2,786.85. BKNG stock has shown tight, healthy trading right along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). But the Nasdaq has encountered resistance just under the 14000 mark, putting some pressure on Booking as well.


The stock slipped below its 50-day line to end the week. Note tha volume on recent down days has been below average. That shows investors are not selling aggressively.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has also dipped while forming Booking's current base. Look for the RS line to climb toward a 52-week high as a potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) nears. Also keep an eye on the [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). Look for volume at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a breakout to show demand for a stock.


Airbnb is also exploring a new buy zone, while facing the same headwinds as Booking Holdings and the general market. On Thursday, ABNB stock found support above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The stock rose just under 2% Friday.

With the 2016 stock market off to an inauspicious start, what might be in store for the big names from 2015? Known as the FANG stocks, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) were among the top performers of 2015.


But when the Nasdaq kicked off the New Year with a sharp drop on Jan. 4 — and gapped down following China's sell-off on Thursday — these closely watched stocks also came under pressure.


**Facebook**


When signs of trouble emerge, see how a stock behaves around the 10-week and 50-day moving averages.

Time will tell if fund managers and other large investors step in to support the social media giant.


The 10-week line is still well above the longer-term 40-week line, and the stock has stayed above its prior buy point as it works on an early-stage flat base. Also note how the Relative Strength line continues to hover near new high ground.


**Amazon**


Amazon also fell below the 10-week line on Monday in volume 107% above average. While trading was higher than normal again as the stock declined slightly Tuesday and Wednesday, volume was trending lower. Also, the daily closes have been fairly tight, although Amazon did fall lower after the Chinese stock market was closed early for the second time this week.


See if the e-commerce and cloud leader can rebound to close in the upper half of the price range for the week.


**Netflix**


Netflix has had the most impressive rebound among the FANG stocks since falling below the 50-day line on Monday. It gained over 9% on Wednesday and closed above the 50-day moving average. Volume was 109% higher than normal, and much heavier than on the prior down days.


While Netflix isn't out of the woods just yet, see if that trend continues.


**Alphabet**


Alphabet has been spent the first few days of the New Year testing its 50-day moving average. It's not clear yet if that benchmark is acting as a floor of support or potentially becoming a ceiling of resistance.


But watching how Alphabet and the other FANG stocks behave around the 10-week and 50-day moving averages will give you an objective look at how the 2016 stock market is shaping up. It also allows you to keep the latest headlines on China, oil prices and other market-moving factors in perspective by seeing what is actually happening with the leading stocks.

As investors look ahead to the New Year, many market watchers expect **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) to be one of top growth stocks in 2016. Several factors are driving the positive outlook for the social media giant, including what you could call the "5 M's":


• **Mobile Ad Revenue:** [Spending on mobile ads](http://news.investors.com/technology/121115-784947-facebook-google-ad-spending-to-rise-in-q4-analyst-says.htm) is expected to jump 38% to $42 billion in 2016. Facebook and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google are poised to pull in the lion's share of that gain, as the Internet icons battle for supremacy in mobile video.


• **Margins:** Facebook's 57.1% annual pre-tax profit margin allows the company to pursue aggressive growth opportunities and tops the margins for Internet rivals Alphabet (33%) and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) (17.6%).


• **Moments:** Facebook may have its next killer app in the form of Moments, a private photo-sharing service. As [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/14/facebook-is-killing-photo-syncing-asks-users-to-download-its-moments-app-instead) reported, starting Jan. 10, users who want to continue accessing synched photos will be required to do so by downloading the Moments app.


• **Messenger:** Facebook's popular Messenger app has become a platform unto itself, with over 700 million monthly active users.


While CEO Mark Zuckerberg hasn't laid out exactly how they'll monetize the app, like with its other properties Instagram and WhatsApp, Messenger has the potential to add significantly to the company's coffers.


Also, in August Facebook launched M, a virtual assistant for Messenger users, similar to Siri from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


• **More Growth Drivers:** 2016 is expected to be the year when virtual reality finally takes off, and Oculus VR, the industry pioneer Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, is set to release its Rift headset in Q1 2016.


According to Juniper Research, overall VR HMD (head mounted display) headset shipments could jump from 3 million units globally in 2016 to nearly 30 million by 2020.


Plus, Facebook continues to successfully monetize Instagram, which it bought for $1 billion in 2012.


In July, eMarketer projected that the photo- and video-sharing social networking platform will generate $595 million in global mobile ad revenue this year and hit $2.81 billion by 2017.


**Key Numbers**


In Q3, Facebook posted earnings growth that more than doubled, from 16% to 33%. Sales growth also improved, from 39% to 41%.


For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 23%, followed by a 32% gain in 2016.


The stock sports the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, while the Internet-Content group earns a 99 Group Relative Strength rating and ranks No. 3 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


But the D Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a good reminder of the selling pressure we've seen in the market in recent weeks. See if that can improve to at least a C or better as we wait for a new uptrend to emerge.


**Chart Analysis**


Facebook cleared a 96.59 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern in October.


It gained less than 20% before pulling back to form a new consolidation, so the current flat base is part of a larger, first-stage base-on-base formation.


In a tough market, Facebook has shown resilience by finding support at its 10-week line. And its Relative Strength line has been moving into new high ground.


The buy point is 110.75, 10 cents above the peak on the left.


While it's risky to make purchases during a correction, keep an eye on stocks like Facebook that are showing strength in a weak market.

 The big-buzz IPO from **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) has so far failed to live up to the hype, but **Athene** ([ATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATH)) is a more under-the-radar new issue that could launch a run when it reports Q1 earnings on Monday.
Founded in 2009, Athene reinsures and acquires fixed annuities and other retirement savings products for individuals and institutions seeking to fund their retirement needs.


The Bermuda-based company has attracted solid institutional demand since going public in December, with 149 funds taking a position in the stock. Athene also sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.2 up/down volume ratio.


By contrast, approximately 42 funds own shares in Snap, which sports a 1.5 up/down volume ratio.


The parent of Snapchat has not yet traded long enough to have an Accumlation/Distribution Rating, since that measures institutional buying and selling over the last 13 week. But the stock is showing signs of a possible rebound, closing the week nearly 8% higher.


No. 2 Rank In Industry
----------------------


Athene holds the No. 2 spot in its industry group with an 87 Composite Rating, just behind **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)).


Since the end of 2015, the company has posted solid quarterly earnings growth, with a 52% rise in Q4. Analysts expect a 36% gain Q1.


Signs Of Technical Strength
---------------------------


Athene has been a steady climber since its IPO, showing consistent support along the 10-week moving average.


The stock is now trying to clear a 55.10 entry in a first-stage base, showing signs of support and demand within the pattern, including a gap-up in heavy volume on April 17.



In another sign of technical strength, the 10-day line has moved sharply back above the longer-term 50-day moving average.


The relative strength line is also near new high ground ahead of the potential breakout — a bullish sign of market leadership.


The stock fell during Thursday's session, but found support at the 10-day line and recouped much of the earlier losses.


Athene dipped again on Friday and closed just below the that short term benchmark. But volume was light and the stock managed to close positive for the week.


While Athene is certainly an IPO to watch, keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports quarterly results.

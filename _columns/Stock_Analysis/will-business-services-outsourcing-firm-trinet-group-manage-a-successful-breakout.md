Today we'll look at TriNet Group (TNET), which went public in March.

  

They help small and midsize companies manage the administrative side of their businesses, such as payroll, human resources, health insurance and retirement plans.

  

Earlier this month, the California-based firm announced the launch of TriNet Hire, a complete hiring and recruiting solution for small and medium-sized businesses.

  

As the [IPO Analysis](http://news.investors.com/investing-ipo-analysis/102714-723602-trinet-small-business-human-resources.htm) noted this week, it's getting harder and more time-consuming for smaller firms to stay in compliance with the growing number of regulations, and that's driving demand for TriNet and similar companies.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Although sales growth has edged slightly lower in recent quarters, TriNet's revenue gains have come in between 44% and 83% over the last eight reports.

  

Earnings growth has been more sporadic, but the company posted a solid 50% rise in Q2.

  

TriNet is scheduled to report third quarter numbers on Nov. 4.

  

For the full year, analysts see EPS growth of 474%, followed by a more modest 25% gain in 2015.

  

The stock's Commercial Services â€” Outsourcing industry group is ranked No. 22 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. That's up from No. 108 just six weeks ago.

  

Overall, the stock earns a 92 Composite Rating and a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating moderate institutional buying over the last 13 weeks.

  

Other signs of demand include the stock's 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio, and the rising number of funds that own shares. Plus, one typically better-performing fund has a stake in TriNet: T Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public in March, TriNet rose steadily until it began forming a cup-shaped base in June. The right side of the pattern was fairly sharp and somewhat V-shaped, rather than smooth and round. Such formations have a higher likelihood of failing and that's what happened with TriNet.

  

The stock broke out in August, but quickly pulled back to form a new consolidation. The current pattern has more of the smooth, rounded shaped you prefer to see in a cup.

  

On Sept. 12, TriNet priced a public offering of 12 million shares of common stock at $25.50 a share. That caused volume to soar 1,684% above average for the week.

  

The stock is now back above its 10-week line, and its Relative Strength line has been trending higher.

  

If TriNet does not form a handle, the ideal buy point would be 30.06, 10 cents above the peak on the left. If it does form a handle, the buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

With the [market back in a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), investors should be on the lookout for top stocks breaking out in heavy volume above proper entries. Casino operator **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) is nearing a potential buy point.




Last week, Macau [gaming revenue growth](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/macau-gaming-revenue-strong-casino-stocks-near-buys/) came in better than expected in March. The reported 22% growth was much higher than the expected 13% to 18% figure. The Chinese gaming hub is the top revenue driver for Wynn Resorts. The casino operates the Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau resorts in the region.


In the most recent quarter — reported on Jan. 22 — earnings growth surged 180% vs. the year-ago period. Revenue growth came in at 30%.


Analysts expect the company's earnings to grow 43% in 2018 and another 19% in 2019, but those estimates have been revised lower.

The gaming and related equipment group is [ranked No. 52 out of 197 groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-apr-12-2018/) and has been in the top 40 groups within the last six weeks. Within the group, Wynn is the top stock, with a 95 out of highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics designed to gauge a stock's leadership ability.


The Stock Chart
---------------


Wynn Resorts is trading within the handle portion of a cup with handle that shows a 192.85 buy point. The cup is a bit lopsided, given the [stock's sharp sell-off](https://www.investors.com/news/wynn-stock-dives-as-ceo-steve-wynn-faces-sexual-misconduct-claims/) on Jan. 26 and Jan. 29, when then-CEO Steve Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct. He stepped down as CEO in early February.


The stock's relative strength line — painted in blue on every [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) and [IBD daily and weekly chart](https://www.investors.com/videos/whats-in-ibd-charts-and-can-you-use-them-to-make-money/) — is nearing a new high. [Shares were mostly steady](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stock-market-top-stocks-near-buy-points/) during the recent market correction, as indicated by a sharply uptrending RS line.



According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), the stock has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating amid a solid rebound in early March. During the six-day win streak, the stock regained its 50-day line in heavy volume.


Keep in mind that the current base is a third-stage base, so it is later in the move. Later-stage bases have less upside potential and are more likely to fail.

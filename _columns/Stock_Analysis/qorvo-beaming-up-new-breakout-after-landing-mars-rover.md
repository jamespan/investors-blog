In February, **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) played an integral role in successfully landing the [Mars Perseverance rover](https://www.qorvo.com/newsroom/news/2021/qorvo-technology-enables-perseverance-rover-safe-descent-to-mars) on the Red Planet. Now Qorvo stock is trying to launch an ascent into a new buy zone.




As a leader in radio frequency (RF) technology, Qorvo explores the frontiers of connectivity through [5G networks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/), [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) and the Internet of Things (IoT).


The North Carolina-based company has now gone interplanetary. It is working with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on mission-critical radar. This radar can help safely guide the descent of the Mars rover.


With the Mars rover ready to roam the Red Planet, Qorvo stock has set its sights on taking off on a new launchpad from its 191.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Qorvo Stock Lands Spot Among Best Large Caps
--------------------------------------------


Qorvo joins fellow [semiconductor sector stocks,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) including chip equipment makers **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


A leader in the semiconductor manufacturing industry group, QRVO stock earns a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), meaning it's outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of [key stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


AMAT stock leads the semiconductor equipment group with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. LRCX stock and KLAC stock are just behind with ratings of 98 and 95, respectively. Teradyne stock gets a 94 Composite Rating, just shy of earning a passing grade in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


In a sign of solid [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), 54 [top mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-growth-stocks-pins-schw-pypl-etsy/) with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Qorvo stock. Highly rated Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) is among those with a position in Qorvo.


Qorvo has posted two quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a 66% increase in Q4. Sales growth came in at 26% in Q4, a slight dip from 31% revenue growth in Q3.


Analysts expect 55% EPS growth in Q1 and a 50% increase in 2021.


QRVO Stock Has New Breakout On Radar Screen
-------------------------------------------


After building multiple [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) since finding renewed strength in March 2020, Qorvo is closing in on a new breakout past its 191.92 buy point in a second-stage base.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is aiming at a new 52-week high as Qorvo moves back above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). On Friday, Qorvo found support at its 50-day line and is now 7% below the new entry.


Look for Qorvo to clear the buy point in volume at least 40% above average. That would show conviction for a new launch.

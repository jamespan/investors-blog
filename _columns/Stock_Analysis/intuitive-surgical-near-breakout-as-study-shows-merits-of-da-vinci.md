Results of a new study, announced Monday, showed patients undergoing procedures with the da Vinci robotic surgical systems from **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) experienced fewer complications than subjects undergoing conventional abdominal and other operations.


The California-based medical device maker noted that “these better outcomes were observed despite the increased complexity of patients in the robotic-assisted group.”


The welcome news helps settle the long-running debate about the merits of the minimally invasive -- but quite expensive -- da Vinci equipment compared with traditional surgery.


Investors liked what they heard, pushing Intuitive’s stock within striking distance of a new buy point.


The [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) member is the established global leader in robotic-assisted surgery, but well-heeled rivals may be on the horizon.


Last year, Google Life Sciences -- now known as the Verily division of **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) -- teamed up with **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) to launch the [Verb Surgical joint venture](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/intuitive-surgical-making-a-comeback-as-robot-surgery-gains-ground/), which will focus on advanced surgical robotics.


**Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) also jumped into the business last year with its purchase of surgical giant Covidien.


Da Vinci Shipments And Procedures On The Rise
---------------------------------------------


Intuitive Surgical’s earnings growth has ranged from 20% to 34% over the last three quarters, with sales growth ranging from 7% to 14% during the same period.


In Q4, worldwide da Vinci procedures -- a key metric for the company -- grew 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. Intuitive shipped 158 da Vinci Surgical Systems, compared to 137 in Q4 2014.


Intuitive Surgical has a solid 19% return on equity, no significant debt and sports a strong 40.4% annual pre-tax profit margin.


Overall the stock earns a 96 Composite Rating, giving it the No. 3 ranking within the Medical – Systems/Equipment group, behind **Cantel Medical** ([CMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMN)) and **Fonar** ([FONR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FONR)).


Rising Volume Ahead Of Potential Breakout

The stock has flashed a number of false starts since trying to launch a new move last April.


Since posting another failed breakout in January, Intuitive Surgical has been working on its current flat base as part of a longer, first-stage base-on-base formation.


The buy point is 580.10, 10 cents above the peak on the left.


Since establishing a bottom in early February, the stock has closed higher for 13 of the last 16 days, with volume rising in recent days as the stock nears a potential breakout.

Today we're going to look at **D.R. Horton**  ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)). It's based in Texas and as a March 28 [New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/032713-649542-aggressive-land-buyer-and-building-bigger.htm) article noted, it does things big.

  

Last year it sold more homes than any other builder. And it's been an aggressive land buyer in recent years. Analysts say that will allow the company to outperform the competition in terms of orders and sales.

  

Horton used to focus on first-time home buyers. But now move-up buyers are its preferred target market.

  

And Horton's homes have become bigger than they used to be because that's what move-up buyers are looking for.

  

The company also has more pricing power on their larger units than on their smaller units and that helps bolster Horton's bottom line.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•After slowing with much of the rest of the housing industry a few years ago, Horton has scored triple-digit earnings growth gains in recent quarters.

  

• Sales growth has been accelerating.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts see earnings rising 54% in 2013 and 46% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-d-r-horton-inc-dhi.aspx) shows Horton's 91 Composite Rating is the sixth highest in its industry group.

  

Other stocks in the group include **Ryland Homes** ([RYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYL)) and two China-based home builders, **Xinyuan Real Estate** ([XIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XIN)) and **China HGS Real Estate** ([HGSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HGSH)).

  

And the group itself is ranked No. 76 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The daily chart above from MarketSmith shows Horton broke out of a cup-shaped base in Jan., climbed a little and then pulled back to the 50-day moving average line.

  

The stock rebounded up from that line and went on to hit a new high.

  

Now it seems to be pulling back again. So watch to see if it can find support at that benchmark line and rebound higher.

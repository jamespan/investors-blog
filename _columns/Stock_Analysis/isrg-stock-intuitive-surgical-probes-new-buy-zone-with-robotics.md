**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), the pioneer in robotic-assisted surgery, is below a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) after a recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). As the market tries to fight off some recent pressure, ISRG stock is now finding support at its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).




Based in Silicon Valley, the robotics leader's offerings include the [da Vinci](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/products-and-services/da-vinci) and [Ion](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/products-and-services/ion) platforms.


For over 21 years, the da Vinci platform has transformed the field of minimally invasive surgery, supporting over 8.5 million operations. As a robotic-assisted endoluminal platform, Ion enables minimally invasive peripheral lung biopsies. Endoluminal refers to a tubular organ or structure, such as a blood vessel or gastrointestinal tract.


While Intuitive Surgical did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-on-tech-stocks-nvidia-salesforce-microsoft-google-netflix/), 332 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in ISRG stock. The stock also sports a strong 2.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


With a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), ISRG stock is outpacing 93% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). That earns it a spot alongside **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and **Omnicel** ([OMCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMCL)) among leaders in the medical systems and equipment industry group.


Over the last three years, the company has posted average annual earnings growth of just 4%, but analysts expect a 46% increase this year. Intuitive Surgical drove 30% sales growth last quarter, helping it earn an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


Intuitive Surgical Looks To Mend After Pullback From Breakout
-------------------------------------------------------------


On Nov. 1, ISRG stock cleared a 362.40 buy point in a [second-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). But since then, the stock has pulled back below the entry. It remains above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) as it so far holds support at its shorter-term 21-day line. Volume on the pullback has been below average on the weekly chart but is starting to rise on the daily chart.


Early Friday, Intuitive Surgical is up nearly 1% in volume trending below average. The stock is now 2% below its latest target entry.


After testing new high-ground around the time of the breakout, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has slipped. See if Intuitive Surgical can shake off the current pressure and resume its climb.


Look for the stock market indexes to show similar action and return to their recent highs.

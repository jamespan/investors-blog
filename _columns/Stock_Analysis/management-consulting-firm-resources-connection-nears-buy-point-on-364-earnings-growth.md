Management Consulting Business Drives 232% Growth
-------------------------------------------------


Founded in 1996, Resources Connection bills itself as a next-generation human capital firm. Named one of Forbes' Best Management Consulting Firms for 2022, the company specializes in helping clients streamline critical business issues, from transactions and regulations to corporate transformations.


Having worked with over 88% of the Fortune 100, Resources Connection annually engages with over 2,500 clients around the world. The company has approximately 5,000 employees, establishing a footprint in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In addition to more than 40 physical locations, the management consulting firm has multiple virtual offices.


In April, Resources Connection announced the expansion of its [HUGO program](https://www.hugobyrgp.com/) into California and Texas. The move follows a successful pilot phase in the New York Tri-State Region.


HUGO is an on-demand staffing platform which directly matches businesses with top-tier accounting and finance talent. Backed by live support, the all-in-one app lets clients view top matches, set rates, communicate directly, and get unprecedented control over end-to-end staffing workflow.

Resources Connection Nears Breakout With Soaring RS Line
--------------------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) soaring to new heights, RGP stock has shot past a 19.52 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/).


Having fared better than most stocks throughout the [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/), its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) has stayed above its 200-day line. The stock remains well above its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


On Friday, the stock spiked nearly 12% in massive volume, pushing it right past the buy point. The stock closed the week slightly extended from that entry.


Making new buys during a bear market or [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) is risky, but stay on the lookout for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to spark a new uptrend.


As the market indexes look to recover, see if Resources Connection can continue to build on recent growth and its rising relative strength.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has no shortage of massive rivals, from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) on the retail front to **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) in cloud computing, to **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) in streaming. And don't forget the battle for voice-control technology and smart devices with Alphabet and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).




As these battles rage, Amazon stock may stage a new breakout.


Through its business rivalries on multiple fronts, Amazon is competing with those companies and others for leadership in a range of categories, from market share and revenue to market capitalization.


Amazon's growth has generally been outpacing that of its rivals, and as a member of the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), Amazon stock is the only one of the names mentioned above to earn a spot on one of IBD's [S&P 500-beating screens](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/). The stock is also on the Leaders Near A Buy Point list on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).

Sales Supremacy: Amazon, Walmart, Apple
---------------------------------------


Walmart remains the largest retailer, generating $123.9 billion in revenue in its most recently reported quarter. Amazon's total sales in Q1 were $59.7 billion, just above Apple's latest quarterly revenue of $58 billion.


When it comes to annual growth rates, Amazon is clearly outpacing its rivals. The Seattle-based retail giant has grown revenue at an impressive average annual clip of 30% over the last three years. Annual increases for Walmart (2%) and Apple (7%) have been in the single digits for the same period.


The difference in the pace of earnings growth has been even more stark. Average annual EPS growth rates for Apple (15%) and Walmart (2%) pale in comparison to Amazon's average gains of 93%.


Before the market open Thursday, [Walmart beat on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q1-2019-walmart-stock/), but missed on overall revenue. It's since found support at the 50-day line and trying to break past a new buy point.

Market Cap Masters Of The Universe: Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Last summer, Apple became the first company in history to hit a $1 trillion market capitalization. Amazon quickly followed suit, but like Apple, it soon fell from the $1 trillion tree.


Today, the world's most valuable company is Microsoft, sporting a market cap of around $989 billion. Amazon is second with $933 billion, followed by Apple ($870 billion) and Alphabet ($812 billion).


By comparison, fellow [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) Netflix ($156 billion), Disney ($202 billion) and Alibaba ($437 billion) are far behind.


Cloud Computing Market Share: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
----------------------------------------------------------------


According to [Synergy Research](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/chasing-pack-gain-market-share-q1-amazon-maintains-clear-lead), the global cloud computing industry grew 42% in Q1, compared to the first quarter of 2018. For the eighth straight quarter, Amazon's AWS cloud services business grew faster than the overall market. Synergy estimates that worldwide revenue for quarterly cloud infrastructure service in Q1 was $21 billion.


As of the end of 2018, research firm Canalys estimates that Amazon Web Services (32.2%), [Microsoft Azure](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-q3-2019-earnings/) (13.7%) and Google Cloud (7.6%) accounted for nearly 54% of the [global cloud computing market](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/cloud-market-share-q4-2018-and-full-year-2018). Other top cloud services players include Alibaba, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)).


In Q1, [revenue for Amazon's AWS unit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-amazon-stock-q1-2019/) was $7.69 billion, up 41% from the year-ago period, with operating income of $2.2 billion.


Kings Of Content Streaming: Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney
---------------------------------------------------------


Amazon has now passed a milestone by having [over 100 million Prime members](https://www.statista.com/chart/5232/amazon-prime-members/). Membership in Amazon Prime offers a wide range of benefits, including video streaming. Rival Netflix has over 139 million members worldwide, while Hulu had 25 million members at the end of 2018.


As participants in a key battlefield in the streaming wars, Amazon and Netflix are both investing heavily to develop an ever-expanding library of original content.


Disney is in the process of taking [full control and ownership of Hulu](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-hulu-streaming-service-comcast-deal/), buying out shares currently controlled by **Comcast** ([CMSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMSA)).


Amazon Stock Nears New Buy
--------------------------


As these battles rage, Amazon stock is closing in on a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The stock is working on the handle within a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), showing an entry at 1,964.50. It's a first-stage base because Amazon undercut the low in its prior pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). The relative strength line is within striking distance of a new 52-week high, a sign of market leadership.


As shown in IBD's latest report on [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-facebook-amazon-netflix-microsoft-alibaba/), Amazon was one of 10 stocks getting over $1 billion each in investments from February to April by these top fund managers. Netflix, Alibaba, Microsoft, and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also made the $1 Billion Club.


On Friday, Amazon stock fell just over 2%, leaving it 4% shy of the buy point. Volume was slightly above average.

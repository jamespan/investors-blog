Why hasn't **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) launched its own AI chatbot? As speculation around the rumored "Apple GPT" grows, [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) has shot into buy range.




**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) has Google Bard. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) powers Bing with ChatGPT. And **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) Chairman Elon Musk's xAI has launched the Grok AI chatbot.


Apple — the largest of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) by market capitalization — is far from new to [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-news/). The iPhone maker puts its focus on weaving AI into its suite of devices. Siri, Apple's virtual assistant, is just one example. Apple also uses AI to enhance and organize photos taken with its cameras.


According to [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/) and other outlets, the famously tight-lipped Apple could have a generative AI feature — internally known as Apple GPT — available on the iPhone and iPad sometime late next year.

Apple Stock Breaks Out On Supplier News
---------------------------------------


While featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day on Dec. 5](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/apple-stock-breaks-out-as-key-supplier-raises-outlook/), the King of Cupertino cleared a 192.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). A positive report by top supplier Foxconn appeared to spark the move.


Apple remains in buy range, showing resilience Thursday as it came off the day's lows to close in positive territory. Apple stock closed the week 3% above the initial entry. The ideal [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/) extends up to 5% above the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


Strong institutional demand has also given Apple stock a boost. In this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shun-nvidia-amazon-embrace-fellow-magnificent-seven-stocks-ai-darlings-apple-microsoft-stock/), top money managers scooped up nearly $4 billion worth of shares in Apple. They also invested $4.18 billion in [MSFT stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/).


Showing intense, but somewhat sporadic demand for the Magnificent Seven stocks, [AAPL](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/dow-jones-tech-titan-apple-ai-giants-nvidia-snowflake-near-buy-points/), [MSFT](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/msft-stock-in-buy-zone-as-microsoft-ignites-artificial-intelligence-innovations-and-fresh-breakout/), [TSLA](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/), [GOOGL](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) have all made appearances on this monthly list in recent reports.


Last month, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) topped the list, raking in a whopping [$16.2 billion](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/amazon-stock-palantir-oracle-and-this-auctioneer-lead-list-of-new-buys-by-the-best-mutual-funds/).


While certainly not the only factor, the [AI lovefest](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/meta-stock-tesla-google-panw-lead-ai-stocks-to-watch-as-best-mutual-funds-fuel-artificial-intelligence-lovefest/) has stoked much of this feeding frenzy.


More Signs Of Demand For Apple Stock
------------------------------------


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-aapl.aspx) points to further signs of demand for Apple. In addition to a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), Apple stock sports eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Overall, Apple earns a 91 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), meaning it is outperforming 91% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Showing the impressive performance of Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple, Meta and Nvidia all trade within buy range. MSFT stock pulled back to test its 366.78 buy point Thursday, moving back into buy range on Friday.


Alphabet continues to encounter selling pressure as it works on a cup-with-handle base.  Google stock remains locked below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


[Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-makes-decisive-move-from-key-level-is-this-a-buy-signal/) has just made a decisive move above its 10-week line in above-average and rising volume. On Friday, Tesla market a fifth straight up week.

As **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) gets ready to report earnings, the stock for the narcolepsy drugmaker may be starting to wake up.

  

One of the most devastating symptoms of narcolepsy is cataplexy — sudden temporary muscle weakness. While there's currently no cure for that rare disorder, [Jazz Pharmaceuticals' Xyrem](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/072815-763793-jazz-pharmaceuticals-grows-xyrem-sales-and-more.htm) is the only FDA-approved product to treat it.

  

Jazz acquired the drug in 2005 and it remains the Ireland-based firm's largest revenue source and its fastest-growing product.

  

Jazz is a member of the Medical — Ethical Drugs industry group, which currently ranks No. 7 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. Other top-rated drugmaker stocks in the industry include **Horizon Pharmaceuticals** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) and **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Jazz's revenue growth has come in between 25% and 68% over the last eight quarters.

  

Earnings growth has ranged from 25% to 43% in the last four reports.

  

The company is expected to report Q2 numbers on Aug. 5.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 15%, then climb 21% in 2016.

  

Jazz sports a strong 39% return on equity and a 63% annual EPS growth rate, helping it earn a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

The 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio shows demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After nearly tripling from a breakout in May 2013, Jazz began correcting in February 2014.

  

Since then, it's formed multiple bases and hit several points of resistance as it failed to gain traction.

  

But trading has generally tightened up with each subsequent base. And the lows within those patterns have been higher than the previous low. That points to a shoring up of institutional support for the stock.

  

Plus, the Relative Strength line is near new high ground.

  

The buy point in Jazz's latest base is 191.11, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

Jazz cleared that entry on Tuesday, rising over 4% for the day on volume 70% above average.

  

The stock slipped back below the buy point on Wednesday, but rebounded to recoup a good portion of the intraday decline.

  

Keep in mind that it's risky to buy a stock just before it reports, but see if Jazz Pharmaceuticals can reclaim the buy point on strong volume, and see what kind of numbers it reports on Aug. 5.

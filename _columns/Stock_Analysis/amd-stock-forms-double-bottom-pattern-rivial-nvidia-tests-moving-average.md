Driven by average earnings growth of 151% the last three quarters, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is designing a breakout to a new all-time high. AMD stock is just 2% below a [double-bottom buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).




AMD stock joins fellow [semiconductor industry](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). Both AMD stock and Nvidia also made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/fang-stocks-best-mutual-funds-buy-amazon-google-parent-alphabet-facebook/).

'EPYC' Innovation For AMD Stock
-------------------------------


In addition to making the list of new buys by the best mutual funds, 272 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning shares in AMD stock. Not to be outdone, 488 A+ funds have shares of rival Nvidia.


Like Nvidia, AMD is a key player in [machine learning, Big Data and AI technology](https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/servers-radeon-instinct-deep-learning). For more than 50 years, AMD has been driving innovation in high-performance computing and, more recently, graphics and visualization technologies.


Among those innovations is EPYC, a new breed of server processors for data centers. Working with companies such as **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)), AMD helps enterprises with cloud computing, human-computer interaction (HCI) and data analytics. The technology partnership between [Dropbox and AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/case-studies/dropbox) helps drive game-changing advances in online storage services.


Earlier this month, AMD also announced the world's fastest high-performance computing GPU and the first x86 server GPU to surpass the 10 teraflops (FP64) performance barrier. AMD has also developed the Ryzen 5000 Series processors to power immersive experiences and accelerate tasks like 3D and video rendering and software compiling.


AMD Among Fastest-Growing Stocks To Watch
-----------------------------------------


All that processing speed has helped Advanced Micro Devices power exceptional growth. In addition to four quarters of triple-digit EPS gains, AMD has generated sales growth ranging from 26% to 56% in its last four reports.


Over the last three years, Advanced Micro Devices has generated average annual earnings growth of 108%. Analysts expect AMD to close out 2020 with 92% EPS growth.


AMD Stock Advances Toward Buy Zone
----------------------------------


Double bottoms are common during times of stock market volatility. AMD's current base is showing 88.82 entry. It's a late-stage pattern which entails more risk.


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) has been trending sideways while the base forms, but is starting to tick higher.


See if AMD can shake off any selling pressure in the general stock market and clear the buy point in strong volume. A breakout would mark a new all-time high for AMD stock.


After breaking out from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) earlier in November, Nvidia has pulled back and is now testing support and resistance at its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). AMD stock is already trading above that benchmark.

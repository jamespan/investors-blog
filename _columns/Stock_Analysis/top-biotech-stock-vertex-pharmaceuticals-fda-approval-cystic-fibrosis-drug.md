Top-rated biotech stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is trying to set up a breakthrough move after getting new U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco.









 
 
 On Aug. 1, Vertex announced the [FDA approved Kalydeco](http://investors.vrtx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1035299) for use in people with cystic fibrosis who have certain residual function mutations.
Based on the approval, Vertex raised its 2017 guidance for Kalydeco revenues from $770 million to $800 million. The company now expects to generate $1.87 billion to $2.1 billion in total revenue for its lineup of cystic fibrosis drugs, which also includes Orkambi.


Leading Stock In Top-Ranked Group
---------------------------------


With the highest possible 99 Composite Rating, Vertex shares top billing in the No. 5-ranked biotech group with **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)), **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) and **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)).


Vertex has averaged 171% earnings growth over the last three quarters. For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 88%, followed by a 95% gain in 2018. Analysts have revised higher estimates for both years.


Institutional demand for shares is reflected in the A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership. An impressive 179 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own the stock.


Biotech Breakout Ahead?
-----------------------


On July 19, Vertex soared over 20% to a record high on [Phase 1 and 2 trial data for triple-pill regimens](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vertex-hits-record-high-on-results-of-cystic-fibrosis-trial/) that one analyst said should have cystic fibrosis patients "breathing easy."


Since then, the stock has been forming a base, which has now turned into a cup with handle with a 163.74 buy point.



On Monday, Vertex closed lower, but found support at its 10-day moving average and its relative strength line is still withing striking distance of new high ground. The stock ended the day about 4% below the entry.


Look for the biotech rally to continue and for Vertex Pharmaceuticals to break out in volume at least 40% higher than normal.


Celgene recently entered a new buy zone, while Supernus, Ligand and Corcept are already extended from prior breakouts.

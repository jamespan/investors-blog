Boosted by an [earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-google-stock-news-q12024/), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) gapped up Friday and earns a spot on [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) just fell off the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) after the stock got slammed on its Q1 report, while fellow [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) no longer makes [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), our most stringent screen. Meanwhile, **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) stands as the only artificial intelligence leader to pull off a trifecta to land on all three of these premier stock lists




The continued buzz around artificial intelligence has driven much of the demand — and growth — for [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [Meta](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-buy-now/) and [Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/). But through its [HubSpot AI](https://www.hubspot.com/products/artificial-intelligence) platform, the company has also emerged as one of the top [AI stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).


Before the Nasdaq took a new hit as shares of [Meta sank on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-slides-despite-q1-earnings-sales-beat/) Thursday, HubSpot stock stood poised to pop back into buy range after finding support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). HubSpot fell over 2% Thursday, but held support at that benchmark. HubSpot held its ground Friday.


Alphabet has now blasted out to more than a 10% gain Friday, propelling Google stock beyond its buy zone.


HubSpot is on deck to report earnings on May 1. Analysts forecast earnings growth of 25% to $1.56 per share. For the full year, they expect an 18% increase to $6.97 a share, followed by a 20% rise to $8.38 per share in 2025.


Although HubSpot did not join Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet or fellow enterprise software stock **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-uber-msft-google-meta/), it shows clear signs of institutional demand.


HubSpot sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Plus, 76 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own the stock. It sports a [98 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-hubspot-hubs.aspx), meaning it is outpacing 98% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).

Will Google Buy HubSpot? Rumor Vs. Reality
------------------------------------------


HubSpot provides a unified platform aiming to seamlessly connect customer-facing teams using AI-powered engagement hubs. The Cambridge, Mass.-based company provides Smart CRM (customer relationship management) and a connected ecosystem with over 1,500 [App Marketplace integrations](https://www.hubspot.com/partners/app), a community network and educational content.


As of the end of last year, HubSpot had about 205,000 customers across more than 135 countries.


On April 4, Reuters reported that [Google was in talks to buy HubSpot](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hubspot-stock-rises-on-report-google-eyeing-bid-for-company/). But in an April 7 report, Jefferies analysts wrote that they "see an acquisition by GOOGL as unlikely given probable regulatory scrutiny and the fact that HUBS uses AWS (Amazon Web Services from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN))), among other reasons."


After an initial spike on the report of the Google-HubSpot talks, HubSpot stock quickly retreated.


HubSpot Stock Looks To Regenerate Buy Point
-------------------------------------------


After sliding off an all-time high toward the end of 2021, HubSpot found a bottom in October of 2022. Since then, the stock has remained in a general upward trajectory, although it had to weather a 20-week long, 30%-deep decline from August to December of last year.


HubSpot went on to form a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) with a 660 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It briefly cleared that entry in heavy volume on the Google buyout report, but soon slipped back below it.


Showing resilience, HubSpot quickly found support at its 50-day line, keeping its new base and buy point intact. As Meta sinks and Alphabet soars on earnings, that resilience is getting put to the test. HubSpot continues to weather the market storm, closing the week above its 10-week line.


On Friday, Nvidia shot back above its 50-day line. Featured April 17 on the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/nvidia-nvda-stock-google-ai-deal/), its 974 buy point remains intact.


Amazon, which reports on April 30, also retook its 50-day line on Friday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted a 2% gain.

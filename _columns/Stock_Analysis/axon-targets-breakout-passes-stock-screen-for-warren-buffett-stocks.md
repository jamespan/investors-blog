With a 17% sustainable earnings growth rate, the security and safety firm passes muster for a new screen of [Warren Buffett stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks-investing-strategy-stock-screen/).




The sustainable earnings growth rate is computed by multiplying a company's return on equity (ROE) by the earnings retention ratio, which is the percentage of earnings not paid out as dividends.

The maker of nonlethal Taser guns is joined on this list by peers **MSA Safety** ([MSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSA)) and **APi Group** ([APG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APG)) in the Security/Safety industry group.

Axon Taps Public Demand For Police Oversight
--------------------------------------------


Based in Scottsdale, Ariz., Axon offers security and safety solutions for a range of industries, including [law enforcement](https://www.axon.com/industries/law-enforcement), [corrections](https://www.axon.com/industries/corrections), [campus](https://www.axon.com/campus-safety-solutions), [personal safety](https://taser.com/) and more.


In addition to its line of market-leading body cameras and accompanying software, Axon also boasts a cloud-based digital evidence platform. Credit Suisse has named Axon a Top Pick for 2023 and is holding an outperform rating.


Axon has embraced a moonshot goal of [cutting gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% in 10 years](https://www.thisisourmoonshot.com/). In 2021, there were 1,118 such fatalities.


In December, the safety technology leader locked down an upgrade to the [highest security level](https://investor.axon.com/2022-12-20-AXON-CLOUD-UPGRADED-TO-HIGHEST-LEVEL-OF-SECURITY-STATUS-BY-US-GENERAL-SERVICES-ADMINISTRATION) by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ([FedRAMP](https://www.axon.com/fedramp)) Joint Authorization Board for its cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. The upgrade will allow Axon's government customers to store the most sensitive, unclassified data handled by federal civilian agencies.


Earnings Growth Set To Rebound This Year
----------------------------------------


Axon's sales growth has ranged from 31% to 34% over the last three quarters. with revenue of just under $312 million in Q3.


Earnings growth has ranged from stellar to spotty over the last eight quarters. In the third quarter, Axon posted a 49% slowdown in EPS growth to 0.60 cents a share. When the company reports at the end of February, Wall Street expects a 10% earnings increase for Q4 but a 15% slowdown for the full 2022.


Analysts see Axon bouncing back to a 34% earnings increase in 2023.


Axon Stock Flashes Support And Demand
-------------------------------------


After breaking out in October, Axon continued to rise, then bolted out to more than a 23% gain in the week ended Nov. 11.


The stock then pulled back to form what became its current base, a [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-cup-without-handle-amazingly-easy-to-spot/). While forming that base, Axon fell below but quickly recaptured its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


The [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) sold off midweek, but the new uptrend remains intact as the Nasdaq bounced above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Axon also retreated, but is showing resilience. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) merits a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/), indicating 52-week high territory — a sign of market leadership.


In addition to that bullish indicator, Axon's spot on the IBD 50, the list of new buys by top funds and the Warren Buffett screen bode well for the stock. Plus, its "A-" [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a strong 2.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) point to demand.


That could mean Axon stands ready to launch a new breakout if the market uptrend gains steam.

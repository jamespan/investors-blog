Rising and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats have **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) securing impressive growth. Now CRWD stock aims to lock down a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) after finding support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).




CrowdStrike did not join cybersecurity peers **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) or **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/tesla-stock-revs-up-demand-alongside-msft-stock-axon-oracle-and-more/). But the Austin, Texas-based company has garnered institutional demand. In addition to a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), 15 funds with A+ rating have reported a position in CRWD stock.


Over the past three years, CrowdStrike has generated average annual earnings growth of 175%. In its most recent quarterly report, the company posted earnings of 57 cents a share, an 84% year-over-year gain. When CrowdStrike next reports in late August, Wall Street forecasts 55% growth. Analysts expect a 55% EPS rise for the full fiscal year and a 29% gain in fiscal 2025.


CrowdStrike has also safeguarded strong top-line growth. It produced $692.6 million in revenue, a 42% gain over the prior-year quarter. Over the past three years, the 2019 cybersecurity IPO has driven average annual sales gains of 63%.

AI And Cybersecurity Threats Mean Global Opportunities For CrowdStrike
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Claiming the world's most advanced cloud-native cybersecurity platform, CrowdStrike focuses on protecting and enabling the people, processes and technologies that drive modern enterprise. Powered by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud, the CrowdStrike Falcon platform leverages real-time indicators of cyberattacks. Simultaneously, it also provides threat intelligence on evolving adversary tradecraft.


In June, CrowdStrike [unveiled 1-Click XDR](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-unveils-1-click-xdr-automatically-identify-and) capability to automatically identify and secure unmanaged cloud assets.


While cloud-based apps provide people and their devices with access to data anytime and anywhere, they also create equally ubiquitous and omnipresent threats and vulnerabilities. The rise of artificial intelligence across the cloud only heightens the challenges for networks. With 1-Click XDR and its other services, CrowdStrike offers protection across GPU-intensive applications such as generative AI.


According to the [CrowdStrike 2023 Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/), 36% of cloud environments had insecure cloud service provider default settings. Plus, cases involving threat actors specifically targeting cloud environments have nearly tripled. To help organizations stop breaches from endpoint to cloud, CrowdStrike expanded its cybersecurity platform with Falcon Cloud Security.


CRWD Stock Looks To Follow PANW Stock And Break Out
---------------------------------------------------


Fellow cybersecurity powerhouses FTNT and PANW stock launched breakouts in May and have now climbed beyond buy range. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike looks to punch through recent resistance and clear a 162.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a first-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). A positive for CRWD stock is that such early stage patterns are more likely to launch successful new runs.


Note how CrowdStrike just found support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and also trades above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The stock edged 1.8% higher Friday, closing the session with more than a 3% gain for the week.


Having slipped while forming its current flat base, look for the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) to continue to perk up and approach a 52-week high as CRWD stock sets up a new move.

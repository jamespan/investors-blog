Parsons Lands Satellite And Missile Defense Contracts
-----------------------------------------------------


Founded in 1944, Parsons enables sustainability and national security solutions across a [wide range of industries](https://www.parsons.com/markets/). Areas of operation include Energy, Cybersecurity, Aviation, Federal Infrastructure, Smart Cities and Missile Defense.


This week, the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.parsons.com/2022/10/noaa-awards-parsons-team-16-million-contract-for-polar-operational-environmental-satellites-operations/) (NOAA) awarded a contract to a team led by Parsons to provide engineering, flight operations support and other services related to the Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19.


The agreement represents new work for Parsons. The $16 million definitive contract has a one-year performance period and two one-year option periods.


Last month, [the defense contractor secured a $104 million contract](https://www.parsons.com/2022/09/parsons-continues-delivering-engineering-support-for-the-missile-defense-agencys-modern-sustainable-infrastructure-under-104-million-contract/) with the Missile Defense Agency. The deal calls for Parsons to continue engineering support for the agency's modern and sustainable infrastructure.


The Virginia-based firm has supported the Missile Defense Agency for many years. The collaboration includes everything from systems modeling and simulation to command, control, communications and battle management.


Propelling Accelerating Growth
------------------------------


Earnings and sales growth have rebounded in recent quarters after a period of deceleration.


Parsons has been fueling a top-line turnaround since a 10% slowdown in Q2 2021. Revenue grew to a minor 1% decline in Q4 2021 and picked up to positive 9% growth in Q1 2022 and 15% in Q2.


Earnings growth has also picked up steam, improving each quarter, lifting from a 23% Q3 2021 slowdown to a healthy 28% spike in Q2 2022.


The company reports third-quarter results before the opening bell on Nov. 2. Analysts forecast 16% EPS growth for the quarter and a 14% increase for the full year.


Parsons Fuels New Buy Point, Stoking RS Line High
-------------------------------------------------


Ahead of earnings and a potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), Parsons' [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has already hit a new high. In this volatile market, the stock continues to work on an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 43.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


In addition, the stock has retaken its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) and the [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) is edging back above the 50-day line, a sign of improving technical strength.


On Friday, jumped nearly 2%, putting it just 1% shy of the buy point. Volume came in just above average and higher than Thursday.


While Parsons' fundamentals and [technicals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) show promise, volatility in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) and Q3 earnings on the horizon call for caution.


See how the company reports — and how Wall Street reacts — to its earnings report on Nov. 2. And look for strong volume on any breakout attempt to provide the sustainable boost needed for the stock to rocket higher.

Today we'll check in on **Kapstone Paper & Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)), which we last featured on Feb. 6. They make unbleached kraft paper and corrugated products for the food, chemicals and other markets.

  

While it's not perhaps the most exciting industry, it has been a profitable one for Kapstone recently.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Although growth slowed somewhat in the first quarter, both earnings and sales have shown strength.

  

EPS growth ranged from 71% to 221% over the last three quarters. And revenue growth has come in between 72% and 87%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 55%, followed by a 17% gain in 2015.

  

Kapstone has a 3-year annual EPS growth rate of 56%, which has been helped by the company's solid 23% return on equity.

  

And its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B indicates moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

  

As you like to see, the number of funds that own shares has been rising in recent quarters, and two typically better-performing funds have reported a position in Kapstone: Allianz AGIC Opportunity C (POPCX) and Turner Emerging Growth Investor (TMCGX).

  

**Daily Chart**

  

Kapstone got a big boost back in June, when it announced its purchase of Longview Paper & Packaging for just over $1 billion and continued higher from there.

  

When we last featured the company in the IBD Stock Analysis on Feb. 6, it was forming a flat base as you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page.

  

The next week, it reported earnings and shot lower, before bouncing back above the buy point in the base.

  

The stock managed to move higher for a few weeks, but then pulled back sharply to start forming its current base.

  

Note how the low in the current formation undercut the low in the prior pattern. That makes it a first-stage consolidation.

  

Also note how its Relative Strength Line has been trending higher, positive sign.

  

You can see how the stock recaptured its 50-day line on Monday, and how the green 10-day line just got back above the 50-day. That's another sign of renewed strength.

  

If the base ends up being a cup-without-handle, the ideal buy point would be 32.92, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

So see if the overall market can rebound into a new uptrend, and if Kapstone can complete its base and break past its buy point on heavy volume.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-kapstone-paperandpackaging-ks.aspx) shows Kapstone carries a 96 Composite Rating, the best among the 21 stocks in its Paper & Paper Products industry group.

  

Less impressive is the ranking for the group itself, which is No. 119 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.

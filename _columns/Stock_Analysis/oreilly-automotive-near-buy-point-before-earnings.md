Analysts expect [Q3 earnings for the S&P 500](http://news.investors.com/investing-ibd-industry-themes/100715-774522-consumer-discretionary-seen-as-winner-in-q3.htm) to fall 5.1%, but profits for the consumer discretionary sector are slated to rise 11.8%. While companies like **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are obvious beneficiaries of that outlook, auto-parts retailers also stand to gain. And **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is the top-rated stock within that group.


Cheaper gas has meant more driving, which leads to more pit stops for maintenance and replacement parts.


That's helped drive the auto-parts retail and wholesale industry group higher in the rankings, from No. 75 three months ago to No. 20 in Friday's IBD.


Like O'Reilly, **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), **Pep Boys: Manny, Moe & Jack** ([PBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBY)) and **Monroe Muffler Brake** ([MNRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNRO)) also have cleared buy points.


**Key Numbers**


O'Reilly Automotive has shown steady growth, with revenue gains ranging from 8% to 10% over the past eight quarters.


Earnings growth has come in at 18% to 28% during that period.


The company is scheduled to report Q3 numbers on Oct. 28.


O'Reilly's 39% return on equity and 25% annual EPS growth rate have helped earn it the No. 1 spot on the IBD Big Cap 20.


Its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 up/down volume ratio and rising fund ownership reflect institutional demand for the stock.


**Chart Analysis**


O'Reilly Automotive's stock has a long track record of tight trading with good support along the 10-week moving average.


In recent weeks, the stock has once again found support at that key benchmark as it works on a flat base with a 258.25 [buy point](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/how-to-determine-a-stocks-ideal-buy-point/).


See if O'Reilly can clear that entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

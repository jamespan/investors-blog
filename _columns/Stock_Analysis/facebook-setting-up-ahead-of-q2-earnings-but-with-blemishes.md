With Q2 earnings due July 27, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is near a potential breakout from an early-stage base. But while the social media giant sports stellar fundamentals, its technical strength is not without flaws.


Facebook has solid three-year annual growth rates for both earnings (68%) and revenue (53%), as well as an annual pretax profit margin of 55.6%. The Silicon Valley-based company has also posted three consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a jump from 46% to 83% in Q1. Can Team Zuckerberg keep the streak alive when the tech titan reports second-quarter numbers next week?


For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 56%, followed by a 30% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


4 Blemishes, But Not Deal Breakers
----------------------------------


Facebook's 96 Composite Rating earns a passing grade and the No. 2 spot within the Internet-Content industry group, behind **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), but ahead of **WebMD Health** ([WBMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBMD)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) -- recently acquired by **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) -- and **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)).


But one blemish for Facebook is the rank of the group itself. It comes in at a lowly No. 116, well below the No. 40 or higher ranking you look for.


The stock also gets failing grades with its D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 0.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio. Look for the Acc/Dis Rating to improve to a C or better, and see if Facebook's Up/Down Volume Ratio can get above 1.0 to show rising demand for the stock.


A fourth flaw is that Facebook's Relative Price Strength line is still well below new high ground, as the stock closes in on a 121.18 buy point. You'd prefer the RS line to be at or near a new high at the time of a breakout.


On the positive side, the stock is back above its 50-day moving average, and volume rose on Monday as Facebook gained over 2%.


Look for volume to come in at least 40% above average on any breakout attempt and see how Facebook reports next week.

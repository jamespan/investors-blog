**Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Restaurants and Uber Eats are driving demand for food delivery services. Now leading potato products supplier **Lamb Weston** ([LW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LW)) has cooked up a solution for a problem plaguing the delivery industry: limp French fries.




Lamb Weston notes that the restaurant industry expects a 20% increase in delivery traffic by 2020. But 30% of consumers placing an order for delivery are not ordering fries due to quality concerns. And their top concern is not having crispy fries.


In February, Lamb Weston launched [Crispy on Delivery](https://www.lambweston.com/crispy-on-delivery-fries) French fries to address those concerns. Using a special coating and unique packaging, Lamb Weston says Crispy on Delivery fries help ensure quality when delivered within 30 minutes.


The innovation could help increase orders, particularly from burger joints and fast-food restaurants, for Grubhub, Amazon Restaurants, Uber Eats and similar services.

2016 IPO Spinoff
----------------


Founded in 1950, Lamb Weston is a global supplier of frozen potato, sweet potato, appetizer and vegetable products to restaurants and retailers. The company had its IPO in November 2016 as it was spun off from **ConAgra Foods** ([CAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAG)).


The Idaho-based company sports a stellar 91% return on equity and a solid 15.2% annual pretax profit margin. For fiscal 2018 Q3 (ended Feb. 25), revenue grew 12% to $863 million, marking the first double-digit gain in at least eight quarters.


After four consecutive EPS declines, earnings growth jumped to a 54% increase in the latest report.


Lamb Weston has shown strong signs of institutional demand, including an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rating-detects-institutional-buying-and-selling-in-stock/), a 1.6 up/down volume ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 150 mutual funds with an A- or higher rating have a position in the stock.


Delivering New Breakout Move?
-----------------------------


Lamb Weston picked a good time to go public — right after the November 2016 election, which spurred a strong stock market rally. Lamb Weston has climbed steadily higher, rising around 130% from the 29.89 closing price of its first week of trading.


The stock is now testing a new 68.80 buy point in a flat base. The pattern is part of a second-stage base-on-base formation.


On Tuesday, Lamb Weston closed at 68.65, just below the entry that it cleared earlier in the day. As you like to see on a breakout attempt, the relative strength line is in new high ground. Look for heavier volume to kick in to show conviction for the move.


On Wednesday, Lamb Weston again poked its head into the 68.80 to 72.24 buy zone. But as the general market pulled back, the stock slipped back below buy range to close at 68.21.


Note that with the [current market outlook](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) at "uptrend under pressure," it's best to proceed with caution and be very picky about making any new buys.

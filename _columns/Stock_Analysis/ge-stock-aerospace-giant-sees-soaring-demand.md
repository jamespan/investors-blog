**GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) has just done something that **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) or any other [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) has not pulled off. Plus, despite a recent stumble, GE stock offers two more reasons for investors to take a look.




1. Demand For GE Stock
----------------------


GE Aerospace just made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-broadcom-stock-avgo-palantir-nvidia/). In fact, GE stock has made this screen [each month](https://www.investors.com/tag/best-mutual-funds-buys-and-sells/) since August. None of the Magnificent Seven stocks have achieved that feat.


Only Meta Platforms comes even close. The Facebook and Instagram parent made the screen this month and in [October](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-meta-stock-ignore-nvidia-other-magnificent-seven-stocks/). Google stock last made the list in [July](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-microsoft-stock-topples-nvidia/), while Nvidia has been [AWOL since June.](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-netflix-cmg-aapl/) Tesla last made an appearance in [August of 2023](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/meta-stock-tesla-google-panw-lead-ai-stocks-to-watch-as-best-mutual-funds-fuel-artificial-intelligence-lovefest/).


In addition, [GE stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ge-aerospace-ge.aspx) sports a 1.3 up/down volume ratio. Any number above 1.0 points to net demand. The defense and aerospace powerhouse also boasts seven quarters of rising fund ownership.


On Oct. 22, shares of [GE fell sharply on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-earnings-ge-stock/), dropping below the 50-day moving average. But the company maintained its 2024 adjusted revenue forecast of high single-digit growth and retook the 50-day benchmark earlier this month. However, it has since slipped back below that line.


Analysts expect GE Aerospace to generate 32% earnings growth this year to $4.32 per share. They see the company delivering a 21% gain to $5.24 a share in 2025.


2. Reset Helps Clear Runway For GE Stock
----------------------------------------


GE stock has made a massive run since hitting a bottom in July of 2022. Starting with a breakout from a first-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) in January of last year, shares rose as much as 118% until notching a new high in July of this year.


Along the way, GE formed three bases. By the time a stock forms a third-stage base, it runs the risk of getting a little long in the tooth. Such [late-stage patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/) can deliver solid gains, but they entail more risk.


GE stock helped mitigate those fears by resetting its base count in August. A reset happens when a stock undercuts the low in the prior pattern, as GE did on Aug. 5. That technically made GE's subsequent consolidation pattern first-stage, giving it a clearer runway for a continued climb.


But the undercut was brief, as GE stock quickly regrouped. So while the new first-stage is a positive sign, investors should still keep in mind the massive run GE Aerospace has already made.


Another reason for caution is GE's breaching of the 50-day line. The stock lost support at that benchmark on Thursday and retreated farther below it on Friday.


3. Clinging To Buy Range
------------------------


In addition to resetting its base count, GE stock has shown other signs of resilience but has come under pressure.


From July to September, the jet engine and aerospace vehicles manufacturer built a base with a 177.20 buy point. GE cleared that entry on Sept. 13, continuing to rise until the sharp pullback on earnings in October.


But shares quickly recovered, propelling GE stock back into buy range. It closed Wednesday's session at 183.56, near the top of its buy zone, which extends to 186.06. But on Thursday, GE stock encountered selling pressure and that has continued on Friday. It managed to close the week right around the initial 177.20 buy point.


Meanwhile, those Magnificent Seven stocks that did not join GE stock on the list of new buys by top funds are feeling pressure of their own as the tech-heavy Nasdaq gets hit.


Like GE, Nvidia had been floating around the top of its buy range, but has now pulled back. The AI powerhouse fell 3% Friday, but found support at its 21-day line.


Google has pulled back after [teasing a breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/google-stock-alphabet-nvidia-breakout-stocks-index/) earlier in the week. But its [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-how-to-spot-a-good-one/) remains intact as it holds above its 21-day benchmark. Meta Platforms — [Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/meta-stock-q3-2024-results-trump-election-zuckerberg/) — continues to work on a third-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) but has retreated below its 21-day and 50-day lines.


And as people [wonder if Mr. Musk is going to Washington](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-elon-musk-donald-trump/) after President-elect Donald Trump's win, Tesla has come off the 52-week high it reached on Monday. After several days of sharp gains, it has pulled back but still trades 20% above a 264.88 buy point it first cleared on Oct. 25. Bucking the market troubles, Tesla stock rose 3% on Friday.

**Mohawk Industries** ([MHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHK)) got its start marking carpet for houses. And in recent years it's become a global leader in the flooring business, making ceramic tile, wood and laminate flooring, as well as carpet.

  

As an Aug. 19 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/081613-667815-mohawk-industries-owns-marazzi-pergo-spano.htm) noted, earlier this year it acquired Marazzi, Pergo and Spano.

  

The companies significantly expand Mohawk's market share in the ceramic tile arena and in Europe.

  

In fact it's now the world's largest manufacturer of ceramic tile and the second-largest carpet maker.

  

Analysts say that's important because it helps them stay in step with consumer preferences. And people aren't using carpet as much anymore as they are putting in hardwood flooring, ceramic tile, vinyl or laminate.

  

In all about 38% of Mohawk's 2012 sales came from carpet, 37% from ceramic and 25% from laminate and wood.

  

Also, about half their sales come from the repair and remodel market, rather than new home construction. So Mohawk is poised to take advantage of the long-awaited recovery in the remodel market.

  

**Key fundamentals**

  

•Earnings growth has been accelerating, coming at 61% in the second quarter.

  

• Sales growth has also picked up, hitting 34% last quarter.

  

• Looking ahead analysts predict earnings will rise 64% this year and 25% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-mohawk-industries-inc-mhk.aspx) shows Mohawk's 93 Composite Rating is the fourth best among the 33 stocks in the Building-Construction Products industry group.

  

**Caesarstone** ([CSTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTE)), which makes quartz countertops, has the group's highest rating.

  

The group has a whole is ranked No. 94 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows Mohawk broke out of a flat base Aug. 1 on volume that was about 48% above average.

  

The next day it got a big boost when it released its second-quarter results, jumping to a new high.

  

Since then it's pulled back to the 50-day moving average line.

  

Watch to see if it can rebound up from the 50-day line on heavy volume. In a market uptrend, that could provide a buying opportunity.

  

But with the market currently in a correction, buying stocks can be risky. So for now this may just be one to keep your eye on.

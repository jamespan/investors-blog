The rivalry between Google, an **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) company, and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is heating up, as both tech giants make increasingly aggressive moves into each other's traditional turf. The goal is to capture an ever-larger share of the fast-growing mobile ad market, and the result could mark a shift in how we find and consume content.


Google continues to dominate online search. According to comScore, it handled 63.9% of U.S. desktop searches in November. And Statista says Google had just under a 90% share of the worldwide mobile search market, as of October.


Through its YouTube unit, Google also remains the undisputed king of online video.


But Facebook's sheer numbers present a growing challenge for Google, particularly in mobile video — the fastest growing area within online advertising.


In addition to over 1 billion monthly active Facebook users, the social media giant's ecosystem also includes over 900 million WhatsApp users and over 700 million users of its Messenger app.


One way Alphabet-owned Google is countering that threat is by building [a new messaging app](http://news.investors.com/technology/122315-786673-new-alphabet-messaging-app-takes-on-facebook.htm), which will likely compete with an **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) Siri-style virtual assistant called M that Facebook is testing within its Messenger service.


Both companies are in the No. 1 ranked Internet — Content industry group, with Alphabet coming in just behind No. 2-ranked Facebook.


**B Is For Breakout**


Following a strong Q2 earnings report, Alphabet jumped 25% during the week ended July 17. It then formed another base that reflected the volatility seen in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


But it found support at the 10-week line before breaking out in October.


Since then Alphabet has shaken off selling pressure in the general market and continued climbing, with its Relative Strength line trending higher.


The stock formed a three-weeks tight pattern in late November, early December, creating a 793.15 buy point. Alphabet cleared that entry Thursday morning and was still trading within the 793.15 to 832.81 buy zone.


The three-weeks tight pattern is primarily viewed as an opportunity to add to an existing position. It's riskier to use the three-weeks tight as an initial purchase, especially in the type of uncertain market we've seen recently.


But the stock's resilience and the continued growth of Google's core business could mean Alphabet is in for a happy New Year.

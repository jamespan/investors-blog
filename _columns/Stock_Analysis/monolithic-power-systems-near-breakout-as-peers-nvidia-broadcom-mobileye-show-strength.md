Fabless semiconductor designers like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **Lattice Semiconductor** ([LSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSCC)) continue strong moves as [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) and other technologies drive demand. Now **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) has etched a new buy point, boosted by impressive growth.




Top-performing money managers have taken note. As the [best mutual funds shoveled $4.5 billion into AVGO stock](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shovel-billions-into-these-five-sectors-including-semiconductors-led-by-avgo-stock/), they also scooped up over $210 million worth of shares in MPWR stock. Peers LSCC ($199 million) and MBLY ($207 million) also took in significant investments from leading funds.

Monolithic Power Systems and fellow [semiconductor](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) companies score an unmistakable presence on IBD's premier [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). MPWR earns a spot on the IBD 50 alongside Mobileye, Broadcom and Lattice Semiconductor. Monolithic Power Systems has also gained entry into the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), joining both Mobileye and Broadcom.


Plus, after recently falling off [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), MPS has reclaimed a spot on the watchlist of companies with strong earnings stability.


A stellar rise in [NVDA stock](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-is-it-a-buy/) earns it placement on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/).


The fabless semiconductor group ranks an impressive No. 9 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Powering AI, Cloud Computing, Smart Homes, Autos And More

Monolithic Power Systems is also working on powering the [next sophisticated artificial intelligence system](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/powering-the-next-sophisticated-ai-system), addressing the multifaceted challenges of AI technology.


Monolithic Power Systems Drives Potent Growth
---------------------------------------------


Over the last three years, Monolithic Power Systems has generated average annual earnings growth of 67%, including a 50% increase in the [fourth quarter](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/about-mps/investor-relations/press-releases.html?pressrelease=414).

MPWR stock earns stellar marks in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-monolithic-power-systems-mpwr.aspx). It earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


AI Leader Eyes Real Breakout
----------------------------


Monolithic Power Systems continues to build a deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) showing aÂ 530.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


As last year's [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/) ravaged tech stocks like Nvidia and others, MPWR stock saw a 44% decline within its base. But it has fought back and has flashed positive chart action amid increased selling pressure in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?).


Monolithic is testing support at its 21-day exponential moving average, while its 50-day line has moved back above its 200-day benchmark.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has jumped while the stock formed the right side of the base and has now hit a new 52-week high ahead of the potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-using-flat-base-chart-pattern/).


But keep an eye on the general market, as the S&P and Nasdaq undercut key moving averages. MPWR, AVGO, LSCC, MBLY and NVDA stock have held up better than the major indexes, but caution is in order as we wait to see how the current turbulence plays out.

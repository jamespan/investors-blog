A key starting point for finding winnings stocks is to look for top-rated leaders in top-ranked industry groups. With a "Best in Group" score for multiple [IBD SmartSelect Ratings](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771) within the No. 3-ranked biotech industry group, **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) fits that bill.

  

The California-based firm develops therapies for HIV and AIDS, liver diseases, oncology, hematology, and other conditions.

  

Along with fellow drugmakers **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), and **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), Gilead made the latest [IBD Big Cap Leaders, a screen at Investors.com](http://news.investors.com/technology/060315-755487-valeant-gilead-celgene-actavis-big-caps.htm).

  

On May 31, the company announced promising phase-three trial results for Zydelig, which helps treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After four quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, Gilead broke its streak when Q1 EPS slipped to a still-robust 99%. Sales growth eased to 52%, snapping a string of three straight quarters of triple-digit gains.

  

Gilead's 99% return on equity helps it earn a solid 98 Composite Rating, and its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.1 up/down volume ratio point to institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Last December, Gilead's share price dropped sharply on news that pharmacy benefits manager **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)) would not cover the high price of Gilead's hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, which costs $94,500 for a 12-week treatment.

  

But the stock found support at the 40-week line and trading has tightened up as Gilead works on the right side of a new base.

  

The relative strength line has been trending higher as the stock nears the 116.93 buy point.

When thinking about the [best financial stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansachs/) or fintech stocks to buy and watch, payment processors like **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), and big banks like **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) may come to mind. But here's another company to have on your radar: **Q2 Holdings** ([QTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QTWO)).




Like PayPal, Square and other [big-buzz IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-dropbox-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/), Q2 took a while to find its footing following its 2014 IPO.


But since breaking out of a double-bottom base in November of that year, Q2's share price has more than tripled. And the banking and financial software firm may now be setting up a new breakout move.

Top Financial Stocks To Watch
-----------------------------


Based in Austin, Texas, Q2 provides cloud-based virtual banking software to regional and community financial institutions (RCFIs). In May, it launched [Biller Direct](http://investors.q2ebanking.com/investor-relations/news/investor-news/investor-news-details/2018/Q2-Launches-Biller-Direct-Enhancing-the-Bill-Pay-Experience-with-Card-Payment-Capabilities/default.aspx), a card-enabled payment solution that offers a new revenue model for financial services providers.


With a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Q2 earns the No. 9 ranking among financial software stocks. **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) holds the No. 1 spot with a 98 rating. The industry group ranks No. 11 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.


Over the last eight quarters, Q2 has delivered revenue gains ranging from 23% to 39%. It also boasts a three-year annual revenue growth rate of 34%. But its 0.4% annual pretax profit margin and 1.1% return on equity are far below the [CAN SLIM Investing System](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) bench marks.


But Q2 has been showing signs of a surge in profitability. The company has delivered three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings gains, albeit based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss. Analysts expect that streak to continue with a 133% increase when Q2 reports second-quarter numbers on Aug. 7. That's also from a year-ago loss.


In a sign of strong institutional demand, 130 funds with an A or higher rating owned shares in Q2, including Columbia Acorn (ACRNX) and Alger Small Cap Growth (ALSCX).


Next Breakout Among Fintech Stocks?
-----------------------------------


After a nice run from a [cup-with-handle base breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in February, Q2 is now working on a second-stage flat base showing a 63.65 entry. Within the pattern, the stock found good support at its 10-week moving average, although it may test that bench mark again.


On Tuesday, the stock briefly poked its head above the buy point, but closed below it as the Nasdaq also retreated from its intraday highs. Q2 has since eased lower, closing the week 4% below the buy point.



Square is out of buy range from its prior breakout, while PayPal has given back the gains it made after clearing an 87.65 buy point. PayPal gapped down Thursday after it reported earnings the day before and [missed on sales guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-earnings-estimates/). JPMorgan is working on a later-stage consolidation. Intuit fell 2% Friday, but remains 48% above a cup-with-handle breakout from last September.

From **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), the titans of tech have their bots and thoughts focused on [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/). Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is certainly no exception. Buoyed by a fresh slate of AI initiatives. [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) has soared into a fresh [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) and beyond.




While announcing artificial intelligence moves at the Google I/O 2023 developers event this week, Alphabet stressed that the business that put Google on the map — advertising — is here to stay.


But as [IBD explains](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/googl-stock-pops-on-ai-news-at-google-io-2023/), questions remain on how an AI alliance between Microsoft and OpenAI will impact Google's core digital ad business.


Google Stock Among 5 AI Stocks To Watch
---------------------------------------


Last year's [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/) ravaged most stocks, particularly tech names. Along with Alphabet, [AMZN](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-buy-now/), [MSFT](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/), [AAPL](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) and [NVDA stock](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-is-it-a-buy/) all took a beating.


With the exception of Amazon, the [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) for each of these companies now stands at 93 or higher.


Reflecting [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-track-institutional-demand-to-find-winners/) for these leading AI stocks (which, of course, have massive footprints beyond artificial intelligence), Alphabet and the others have a B or better [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/). This unique rating tracks big-lot buying and selling by mutual funds and other large investors over the last 13 weeks.


Microsoft topped the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-bet-billions-on-these-10-stocks-including-microsoft-salesforce-broadcom/), with top money managers scooping up over $10.2 billion worth of MSFT stock. Still hampered by last year's shift away from tech, none of the other AI stocks shown here made the cut, including Alphabet.



 


| Company | Symbol | Comp Rating | EPS Rating | RS Rating | Ind Group RS | A/D Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nvidia | NVDA | 97 | 63 | 97 | A- | A |
| Microsoft | MSFT | 95 | 90 | 91 | B+ | A- |
| Alphabet | GOOGL | 94 | 75 | 89 | A+ | B |
| Apple | AAPL | 93 | 80 | 89 | A- | B+ |
| Amazon | AMZN | 74 | 41 | 81 | A- | B |


Alphabet Maps Out A Rebound
---------------------------


As tech tumbled last year, so did the cloud and search giant's earnings and sales growth. Alphabet's revenue growth fell into the single digits, ranging between 1% to 6% the past three quarters. Earnings growth also dried up, showing quarterly EPS slowdowns for the entire year.


Alphabet kicked off 2023 by [topping Q1 earnings and sales estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/googl-stock-google-earnings-news-q12023/). Analysts forecast 7% earnings growth in current Q2 and a 16% jump for the year.


After last year's slump, the company's [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/) slipped to a B, but Alphabet maintains a solid 26.2% annual pretax profit margin and 24.5% annual return on equity.


While its core digital advertising business, the [Google Cloud platform](https://cloud.google.com/developers/corp-eng), the promise of [generative AI](https://ai.google/discover/generativeai) and other initiatives continue to spur growth for Alphabet, the competitive landscape with Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and others is guaranteed to heat up.


Google Stock Turbocharges Its Ascent
------------------------------------


Alphabet cleared a 106.69 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) on April 6 — prior to reporting Q1 earnings on April 25. Google stock meandered in and out of buy range before spiking to the top of its buy zone on Wednesday. Volume spiked 87% higher than normal. It is also possible to see a larger cup base with a 122.53 buy point.


On Thursday, blasted beyond its buy zone, gapping up to close over 4% higher in heavy and rising volume. Google stock added to those gains Friday, closing with a weekly gain of more than 11%.


Meanwhile, fellow AI stocks Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple continue to ride the tech rebound. Even Amazon stock has shown resilience, jumping back above its 200-day line in strong volume.

After one year of the Covid-19 pandemic, the [share of cashless businesses has more than doubled](https://investors.squareup.com/news/news-details/2021/After-One-Year-of-COVID-19-New-Square-Data-Reveals-the-Share-of-Cashless-Businesses-Has-More-Than-Doubled/default.aspx), according to a new study from **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)). The trend has SQ stock and fellow payment processor **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) charging higher off their coronavirus lows, with both stocks also getting a boost from Bitcoin.




Square said the "steady increase in cashless adoption rates and online and contactless payments demonstrates a renewed preference toward digitization among business owners and consumers."


Boosted by that trend — and estimates calling for 900% earnings growth in Q1 — SQ stock holds top billing in the payment processing industry group. With a 98 [Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) Square handily beats PYPL stock, which scores an 89 rating. Analyst expect [PayPal](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) to deliver 53% EPS growth for the first quarter.


[SQ stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/) and PYPL stock have both secured placement on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of today's top growth stocks. PayPal is also on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), while Square stock has also joined the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).

Payment Processing Trends: Cashless Vs. Less-Cash Society
---------------------------------------------------------


From before the pandemic in 2020 to today, Square said the share of cashless businesses has more than doubled in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, while nearly doubling in Japan.


As a result of the push for online and contactless payments, Square said the number of cashless sellers in the U.S. went from 6.3% in February 2020 to 14% in February 2021. During the same period, the share of cash transactions dropped from 37.5% to 30.5%.


The study showed that the number of U.S.-based Square retailers accepting contactless payments rose from 64% to 74% from February 2020 to February 2021.


While the trend to using less cash is clear, it doesn't mean we're on the verge of becoming a cashless society. According to the study conducted by Wakefield Research, 73% of American consumers and 68% of small business owners say the U.S. will never become a completely cashless society.


But among U.S. small business owners who disagree, 22% think the U.S. will become completely cashless in 10 years or fewer. That marks a jump from just 13% in 2019.


[Bitcoin trends](https://www.investors.com/news/investing-in-bitcoin-hits-tipping-point-after-price-of-bitcoin-skyrockets-on-mania/) are also garnering increasing interest for both SQ stock and PYPL stock.


SQ Stock Vs. PYPL Stock
-----------------------


While Square has bigger earnings estimates for Q1 and 2021, PayPal has an edge when it comes to overall fundamentals.


PayPal sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), with a 25.6% pretax profit margin in 2020 and a 25% return on equity. Square also has an A SMR Rating and earns a passing rating in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) for its 19.4% ROE, but comes up short with a 4.5% pretax profit margin.


Both of these leading growth stocks have solid [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


SQ stock has seen five quarters of rising fund ownership and has a 1.2 up/down volume ratio. Including Fidelity OTC (FOCPX), 316 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Square stock.


Fidelity OTC and 406 other of the best mutual funds have a stake in PYPL stock. PayPal has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Square Stock Nears Breakout As PayPal Follows Suit
--------------------------------------------------


SQ stock is working on a new [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) showing a 283.29 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). PYPL stock is also basing with a 309.24 entry.


Square stock has moved back above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), while PayPal has also just cleared that benchmark line.


The [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) for both stocks have fallen off recent highs but are beginning to trend higher.


See if recent boosts from Bitcoin rejuvenates their RS lines and lifts SQ stock and PYPL stock into new buy zones.

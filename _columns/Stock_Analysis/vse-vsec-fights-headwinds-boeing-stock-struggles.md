While industry giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) struggles to come out of a long slump, fellow aviation firm and partner **VSE** ([VSEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VSEC)) looks to navigate a breakout amid a turbulent and stormy market. Like the Nasdaq, Boeing stock remains stuck below its [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). But VSE trades above both benchmarks as it teases a new buy point.


And as VSE announces a milestone shift in its business, Wall Street has set its sights on the stock, as indicated by multiple telltale signs.




Boeing Partner VSE To Sell Fleet Business
-----------------------------------------


In February, VSE announced it will [sell its Wheeler Fleet Solutions segment](https://ir.vsecorp.com/news/press-releases/detail/372/vse-corporation-announces-agreement-to-sell-fleet-segment), putting full focus on its [VSE Aviation](https://vsecorp.com/vse-aviation/) business. The sale to One Equity Partners is expected to close during the second quarter.


With more than 850 employees around the world, VSE Aviation serves the aftermarket parts and services markets. The company's footprint spans four key areas, including aftermarket distribution, manufacturing and maintenance, repair and overhaul services. VSE also maintains a substantial business in "rotable" components, which bolster the aviation firm's repair, replacement and overhaul operations.


VSE has a history of partnerships with both Boeing and **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)) to provide parts and support.


Wall Street Shows Demand For VSE
--------------------------------


Turbulence on the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) calls for caution across the board. But VSE is trying to fight those headwinds and break out.


On Wednesday, the aviation stock briefly cleared a 121.50 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) before retreating sharply on Thursday. On Friday, VSE rose 1% as the Nasdaq rallied.


In an environment that spells trouble for most stocks, VSE has shown impressive [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/). Its RS line has notched a new 52-week high, earning it a coveted [blue dot in MarketSurge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-technical-analysis-marketsurge/). That shows shares of VSE are outpacing the benchmark S&P 500 index.


Signs of demand for VSE include a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-up-down-volume-ratio-spots-underlying-demand-for-stocks/). Eight quarters of rising fund ownership, as shown in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-vse-vsec.aspx), further showcase demand for the stock.


Meanwhile, Boeing stock is trying to regain its footing, closing higher for a fourth straight day Friday. But the aircraft maker remains around 4% below its 200-day line. Airbus, on the other hand, rose 4% Friday, ending the week at the top of its buy range from a [first-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/).

Investors have been in an unforgiving mood this earnings season, as evidenced by a sharp sell-off in **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) on Friday, even though it posted a 206% rise in earnings the day before.


Now rival e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and social media titan **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are on deck to report their Q3 numbers on Wednesday.


To complicate matters, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Alibaba in regards to certain accounting practices, and a new report says [the investigation is being aided by a whistleblower](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-investigation-by-sec-into-accounting-aided-by-whistleblower/). Alibaba's stock was down in early trading Tuesday on the news.


Facebook Vs. Alibaba: A Tale Of Two IPOs
----------------------------------------


Like Alibaba in September 2014, Facebook was a big-buzz IPO in May 2012. But both stocks struggled soon after their market debuts.


Facebook famously face-planted immediately after going public, and it wasn't until July 2013 that the company found its mobile mojo and returned to strong earnings growth, launching a major move for its stock.


Aside from a short-lived breakout from an IPO base in Nov. 2014, Alibaba's stock also failed to deliver on the pre-IPO buzz.


But this year's strong Q2 earnings report lifted the stock out of a 21-month slump.


The question now is, can Alibaba deliver again when it reports Q3 earnings? Analysts expect the company to show accelerating growth, with earnings rising 29% and sales up 54%.


Investors will also be watching the results of Alibaba's flagship sales event, Singles Day, on Nov. 11.


As a tent-pole shopping extravaganza similar to Prime Day from Amazon, Singles Day generated $14.3 billion in sales in 2015, up from $9.3 billion in 2014. Note that one aspect of the SEC probe is how Alibaba calculates its Singles Day sales.


Time To Buy — Or Bypass — Alibaba?
----------------------------------


Since peaking in late September, Alibaba has been working on a second-stage flat base with a 109.97 entry.



The stock has been testing the 50-day moving average in recent days, and closed just below that benchmark on Monday in rising volume. Early Tuesday, Alibaba fell further below that benchmark.


Signs of institutional demand for shares include four straight quarters of rising fund ownership and a 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio, but the chart action should be the ultimate arbiter of whether Alibaba becomes a stock to buy — or bypass.

**Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)) partner **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is selling off sharply on disappointing earnings. But Funko stock is still toying with a potential breakout as it holds support at its 50-day line. Can the maker of pop culture collectibles clear resistance and keep the good times rolling?




Heading into the report, Ulta and Funko both found slots on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of today's [best growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), but the cosmetics leader may be set to fall off the list. [Ulta earnings missed analyst views](https://www.investors.com/research/ulta-stock-sets-buy-point-ulta-beauty-earnings-q2-2019-due/) and the company slashed its full-year guidance.


[Funko and Ulta Beauty](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-funko-collaboration-dow-jones-stock-disney-ulta-beauty/) have teamed up to offer products inspired by **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) characters. Featuring four Disney villains, including Cruella de Vil and Maleficent, the Ulta Beauty and Funko partnership marks the toymaker's first cosmetics collection. Despite the rough, post-earnings start, could this mark the beginning of a beautiful friendship?

Funko Stock Toys With Resistance
--------------------------------


After going public in November 2017, Funko formed a base then bolted 237% higher before retreating. The stock has been rebounding, setting up new consolidations and retaking its 10-week moving average. But Funko stock is again encountering resistance, and is still trying to decisively clear that key benchmark.


Although the Everett, Wash.-based company has generated average EPS growth of 286% over the last three quarters and average annual earnings gains of 31% over the last three years, analyst growth estimates appear to be slowing. For the current quarter, the consensus calls for just 18% earnings growth.


So far, [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) for Funko stock remains solid. Funko sports a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), 1.4 up/down volume ratio, and five quarters of rising fund ownership. While not dominating by any means, the company did earn a spot on the [top new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-microsoft-servicenow-yeti-paypal-transdigm/) in the latest report.

The company closed the week nearly 9% higher, leaving it 6% below the buy point.

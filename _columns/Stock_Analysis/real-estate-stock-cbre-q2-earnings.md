With Q2 earnings due next week, real estate giant **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) is trying to seal the deal on a potential new breakout. CBRE is the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, with a client list that includes 85% of the Fortune 100.



But as IBD's [The New America column](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/060815-756257-cbre-group-eyes-organic-and-external-growth.htm) in June, CEO Bob Sulentic says the company still has plenty of room to grow.


That's because, while CBRE boasts that it's the global market leader in all of its business lines, it doesn't hold a market share of more than 15% in any of them.


Fellow real estate firms **Marcus & Millichap** ([MMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMI)) and **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)) are also near potential buy zones.


**Key Fundamentals**


In Q1, CBRE's earnings growth beat estimates, jumping from 3% to 28%. But revenue came up short, as the strong dollar left sales growth lost in currency translation.


CBRE is expected to report second-quarter numbers on July 29.


The company sports a solid 27% annual EPS growth rate and 27% return on equity, helping it earn a 91 Composite Rating.


**Chart Analysis**


CBRE is working on a second-stage pattern as part of a longer base-on-base formation.


Although a fair amount of the base was spent below the 10-week line, trading has stayed within a tight range right around that benchmark line.


The stock has flashed several up days on above-average volume in the right side of the base. That trend points to institutional buying.


The buy point is 39.87, 10 cents above the peak on the left.


See if CBRE can post strong Q2 numbers next week and break out on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

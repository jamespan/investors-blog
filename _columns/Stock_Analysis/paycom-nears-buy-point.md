Paycom Software is quickly approaching a 41.68 buy point in a consolidation. But will the third time be the charm for the stock to produce big gains?

  

**Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) stock broke out in May and in August. Despite the strong volume on both breakouts, the stock eventually fizzled after early strength. A stock offering in mid-May derailed a breakout from May 8. Another breakout on Aug. 17 soon started to fall apart as overall market conditions deteriorated. News of another share offering also put the hurt on the stock Sept. 16.

  

This time around, the stock's current pattern has a few things going for it. First, Paycom found support at its 200-day moving average in late September and has been on a tear since. It's been down only two days since Sept. 29. Both of those declines were on bone-dry turnover. Paycom's 200-day line had also acted as support in late July.

  

Buying interest has increased sharply. Paycom's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to C+ from a worst-possible E late last month.

  

The stock's Relative Strength line has also climbed into new-high territory ahead of price, a bullish sign.

  

Paycom's price action has been wide and loose, which is a negative. Calm, constructive price action is what investors should look for in a base. But Paycom has had a history of volatile price action since [going public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in April of 2014.

  

Oklahoma City-based Paycom provides cloud-based human capital management software. Basically, a suite of applications does things ranging from applicant tracking and background checks to time and labor management, payroll and tax management and performance management.

  

Paycom grew earnings by triple digits in its most recently reported two quarters. But growth is expected to slow, as analysts see Paycom's third-quarter earnings rising 40% to 7 cents a share. The firm is slated to report in early November.

The 3D printing industry has been shaking up manufacturing, one prototype and functional part at a time. And top fund managers appear to be betting on **Proto Labs** ([PRLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRLB)) to lead the revolution, over **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)), **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)), **ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)) and even tech giant **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)).


Four of the 19 funds in the IBD Mutual Fund Index have reported a position in Proto Labs, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)). Only one of these typically better-performing funds -- Scout Small Cap ([UMBHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMBHX)) -- owns shares of Stratasys, and none of them owns shares in the other major industry players.


3D Printing: Sell The Service, Not The Machine
----------------------------------------------


Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys, which make and sell a mix of consumer and commercial 3D printers, Proto Labs focuses on the commercial market and offers industrial 3D printing as a service.


With the motto “Real Parts, Really Fast,” Proto Labs’ mission is to “radically reduce” the time to create prototypes and functional end-use parts.


It’s been a profitable business model, as evidenced by Proto Labs’ 32% annual EPS growth rate and 31.5% annual pretax profit margin.


The Minnesota-based firm, which has an industry-leading 99 Composite Rating, recently made Fortune’s list of the 100 fastest-growing public companies.


Signs Of Accumulation Ahead Of Potential Breakout

But after the run came to an end in November 2013, the stock went into a multiyear slump.


It's now showing signs of a rebound, flashing several heavy-volume up weeks as it builds the right side of a base with an 80.05 buy point.


On March 4, the stock jumped over 8% on news that Proto Labs would be added to the S&P SmallCap 600 GICS Industrial Machinery Sub-Industry index. Volume came in 1,089% above average.


The stock's Relative Strength line has been trending up and is hovering near new high ground ahead of a potential breakout.

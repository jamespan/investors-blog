As **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) acquires **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) and **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) sets up a base, fellow clinical research organization **PPD** ([PPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPD)) is nearing a potential new buy point of its own.




PPD stock, which went public in February 2020, has earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) list of top [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) to watch. The operator of clinical trials joins fellow medical sector stock **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) on this [stock screen](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/). Due to recent selling pressure, **Progyny** ([PGNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGNY)) and **Maravai Lifesciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)) just fell off the list.


Based in North Carolina, PPD strives to "bend the cost and time curve of drug development." The company works with pharmaceutical and biotech partners across clinical trials in a wide range of therapeutic areas, including vaccine development, gene therapy, infectious diseases and pediatrics.


PDD has a global [vaccine development](https://www.ppd.com/how-we-help/covid-19/) team addressing the challenges of Covid-19. In less than two weeks through its central lab, PPD Laboratories achieved study startup, implementing web-based data solutions to enhance oversight for [critical Covid-19 studies](https://www.ppd.com/our-solutions/ppd-laboratories/ppd-laboratories-covid-19-solution/).


With its central lab in Kentucky and its vaccine sciences lab in Virginia, PPD has more than 25 Covid-19 drugs in development. The company brings extensive experience to addressing the coronavirus pandemic, including having supported 15 vaccine programs approved by the Federal Drug Administration and over 25 years supporting vaccine efficacy programs.


Clinical Trial Competitors: PPD Vs. Charles River Labs
------------------------------------------------------


PPD was founded in 1985 and went public last year. In terms of market capitalization, it's comparable in size to peer Charles River Labs, which was founded in 1949. PPD stock has a market cap of $13 billion, compared with $13.9 billion for Charles River stock. Icon stock has a market cap of just under $10 billion.


Over the last three quarters, average earnings growth for PPD (65%) has outpaced that of Charles River Labs (18%). Analysts expect that to continue in Q1, with PPD looking for a 41% EPS increase vs. an 18% gain for Charles River.


Both stocks have solid [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/). PPD has a slight edge with a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) compared to a B- rating for Charles River Labs. Twenty-one of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in PPD stock, while 66 funds with the same rating have a position in CRL stock.


Support On Trial For PPD And CRL Stock
--------------------------------------


While Icon stock is trading below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), clinical trial specialists PPD and Charles River Labs are both testing that benchmark area of support. PPD has been finding support at the 10-week line.


PPD is forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) as it tries to clear a 38.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock rose nearly 3% Friday on below-average volume, ending the week 2% shy of the buy point.


Charles River stock has also come under pressure as it builds the same type of [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), this one with a 303.89 entry. CRL stocko rose more than 2% Friday in below-average but rising volume.


See if PPD and Charles River Labs can hold their ground and successfully complete their current trials.

Unlike retail stocks **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and T.J. Maxx owner **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), fellow retailer **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-unitedhealth-texas-instruments-united-airlines-expeditors/). But it is testing a new buy point as it gets ready to report fiscal 2019 Q2 earnings on Aug. 21.




Mutual fund managers and other large investors have been heavily buying [retail stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) in recent months. The Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which includes Urban, TJX, Ross, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), and **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), ranks No. 15 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks. Four other retail sector groups also rank in the top 40, including Office Supplies (No. 1), Jewelry (No. 3) and Internet retailers (No. 13).


This renewed interest in retail stocks by institutional investors reflects how many brick-and-mortar stores have learned to compete with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and return to profitability.

Retail Stocks To Watch With Q2 Earnings Due
-------------------------------------------


Urban Outfitters posted a 280% spike in fiscal 2019 Q1 earnings in May, marking its fourth straight quarter of improvement. For Q2, analysts are looking for a 75% rise. Revenue gains have increased in the last three reports, coming in at 12% in the April-ended quarter.


Lululemon, which shares the No. 1 ranking among apparel retail stocks with **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)), is expected to report earnings later this month. TJX is set to release its latest number on Aug. 21, followed by Ross Stores on Aug. 23. Burlington is also expected to report in the next couple of weeks. With the exception of TJX, each of these retail stocks reported accelerating EPS growth last quarter.


Boot Barn, which was recently featured as an [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-of-the-day-boot-barn-breakoutbuy-range-earnings-outlook/), reported a 700% spike in earnings for Q2.


Retail Stocks Near A Buy Point
------------------------------


After rising 33% from a February breakout, Urban Outfitters pulled back in June to start forming its current [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The stock has found support at its 10-week line and rose nearly 2% Thursday to 47.54.


On Friday, the stock temporarily cleared the 48.34 buy point, but ended the day just pennies below it with a 1.6% gain to 48.28. Volume was rising, but below average. The relative strength line is just below a 52-week high.


Urban Outfitters currently has a moderate C Accumulation/Distribution Rating but has posted three consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership. Its [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) has also improved to a 1.2, a sign of demand. Keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock right before it reports earnings. It's generally safer to wait to see how the company reports and how the market reacts.



Burlington Stores continues to float in and out of the 158.33 - 166.25 buy zone it initially entered on July 23. It ended the week at 159.52. After a big gap up on June 1 following earnings, Lululemon has eased back to its 50-day moving average, but has been bouncing off that benchmark line. It jumped 1.8% Friday to 130.52. TJX and Ross Stores are both extended from earlier breakouts.


After a big gap up to clear a 25.55 buy point on Aug. 8, Boot Barn has been pulling back. It remains within the 25.55 - 26.83 buy zone.

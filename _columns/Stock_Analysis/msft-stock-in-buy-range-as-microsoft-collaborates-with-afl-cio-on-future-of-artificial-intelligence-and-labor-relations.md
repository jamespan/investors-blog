Many unions fear that automation and [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-news/) spell doom for organized labor and the workers they represent. Not so, says **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), one of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) driving AI. And since signing a historic deal with the AFL-CIO, [MSFT stock continues](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) to build on its latest breakout, showing tight, resilient trading.




Earlier this month, Microsoft and the AFL-CIO announced a [new tech-labor partnership on AI](https://news.microsoft.com/2023/12/11/afl-cio-and-microsoft-announce-new-tech-labor-partnership-on-ai-and-the-future-of-the-workforce/). The collaboration aims to create an open dialogue to discuss how AI must anticipate the needs of workers.


This first-of-its-kind deal between a labor organization and a technology company aims to deliver on three goals.


One is to share in-depth information with labor leaders and workers on AI technology trends. The second is to give voice to workers on the development of AI technology. Finally, Microsoft and the AFL-CIO seek to shape public policy that supports the technology skills and needs of front-line workers.


Meanwhile, Microsoft edged out fellow AI powerhouses **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) to get called the "[Top Large Cap Pick For 2024](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-called-top-large-cap-pick-for-2024/)" by Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan.

Top Funds Fuel Demand For Microsoft Stock
-----------------------------------------


In this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shun-nvidia-amazon-embrace-fellow-magnificent-seven-stocks-ai-darlings-apple-microsoft-stock/), top money managers shunned [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/research/nvidia-stock-magnificent-seven-leader-in-buy-zone-in-todays-stock-market/) and [Amazon](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/amazon-stock-tests-buy-zone-forms-bedrock-of-brave-new-ai-ev-world/) in favor of Microsoft and Apple. The best-performing fund managers scooped up $4.18 billion worth of shares in MSFT stock. They also plowed more than $4 billion into [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/apple-stock-breaks-out-into-buy-zone-as-apple-gpt-chatbot-rumors-swirl/).


Further, with a strong track record of stable earnings growth, Microsoft earns a spot on the exclusive list of [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). Plus, MSFT stock sports a strong 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), another sign of demand.


On Oct. 24, the cloud computing and AI leader posted earnings per share of $2.99, a 27% year-over-year gain, during the fiscal first quarter that ended Sept. 30. That marked a third-straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales also have been on the rise in recent quarters, coming in at $56.5 billion in the most recent period.


Showing the strength of the Magnificent Seven stocks and the tech sector as a whole, Microsoft also joins Nvidia, Amazon and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/).


MSFT Stock Rides AI Trends Into Buy Range
-----------------------------------------


With support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and a rising [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), Microsoft remains in buy range following a Nov. 10 breakout. Tight, sideways trading points to resilience, a sign that large investors have are holding onto their shares. [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/apple-stock-breaks-out-into-buy-zone-as-apple-gpt-chatbot-rumors-swirl/) is showing similar action following its recent breakout.


MSFT stock reversed higher Thursday, and edged higher again Friday to close out the week. Microsoft now trades 2% above its initial 366.78 entry.


One blemish is the somewhat-lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/). Look for that to turn higher as Microsoft builds on its new move. Microsoft's [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-microsoft-msft.aspx) also has dipped, but remains strong at 95, meaning it is outpacing 95% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Meanwhile, other Magnificent Seven stocks like Nvidia, Apple, Meta and Google stock all continue to trade near or just above their [buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/). Showing resilience following Wednesday's selling pressure, MSFT stock and its fellow tech titans continue to show strength.

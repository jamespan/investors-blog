As fellow [IBD 50 stock](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and enterprise software industry peer **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) tries to access a new buy zone in a challenging market, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is also trying to make its own new base pay off.









 
 
 Paycom provides cloud-based payroll and HR solutions, and shares the No. 1 ranking in the enterprise software group with LogMeIn. Both stocks sport a 98 Composite Rating.
Profitable Track Record
-----------------------


Founded in 1998 with its IPO in 2014, Paycom has built a solidly profitable business helping companies manage all stages of the employee life cycle, from recruiting to retirement.


The company has a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 138% and a 24% annual pretax profit margin. Paycom's 24% rise in earnings in Q2 topped the consensus analyst estimate.


Revenue has risen at an annual clip of 47% over the past three years, including gains of 33% to 35% over the past three quarters.


Analysts expect earnings to rise 32% this year and 24% in 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher by analysts.


A B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.3 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for Paycom.


Seeking Qualified Breakout
--------------------------


On Aug. 2, the stock swung wildly in massive volume following its Q2 earnings report, but managed to close just below the 50-day moving average as it continued to work on a second-stage flat base.



It has since climbed back above that benchmark line, but in low volume. As the [Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off sharply](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-take-a-header-as-nasdaq-sp-500-give-up-support/) Thursday, Paycom also slipped lower to close 4% below the 73.71 buy point.


On Friday, Paycom was down fractionally in light volume. Its relative strength line remains within striking distance of new high ground, and it managed to hold support at its 10-day moving average.


While it's risky to buy stocks when the major indexes are under pressure, see if the market can regain its footing and if Paycom can continue to show support and resilience. If the stock does break out, look for volume to rise sharply.

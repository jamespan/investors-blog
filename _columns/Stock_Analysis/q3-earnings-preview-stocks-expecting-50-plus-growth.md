With third-quarter earnings season kicking into high gear, now is the time to build your list of the [best stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/), with a focus on companies like **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and **Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) that are expected to deliver earnings growth of 50% or higher.









 
 
 It's also crucial to keep a close eye on [current market conditions](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) to see if the underlying uptrend continues to hold or if selling pressure mounts. If the [market outlook shows a change in trend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2102289) for the worse, it becomes riskier to make new buys and tougher for even the best stocks to make a sustained run from a new breakout.
To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and meet the following benchmarks for their [IBD SmartSelect Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measure the most important stock-picking criteria:  

• 90 or better Composite Rating.  

• 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating.  

• 80 or greater EPS Rating.


Stocks Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q3 Earnings
-----------------------------------------


The stocks on this list are expected to report Q3 earnings over the next several weeks. Take the reporting date into consideration when deciding whether or not to buy on a breakout, since purchasing a stock just ahead of earnings can be risky. Also note that most of the stocks on this list are already extended after clearing recent buy points.


To build and update your  earnings season watch list, regularly check the [earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) to see which stocks are getting ready to report, and keep an eye on IBD's daily highlights of [stocks near a buy zone ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/tag/Stocks-Near-Buy-Zone-Ahead-Of-Earnings/).


Square, which offers payment-processing solutions and analytics to retailers, had been floating in and out of buy range following a Sept. 14 breakout. But the stock has since taken flight and is now extended beyond the 28.07 buy point. On Thursday, the stock was heading lower as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off, but was finding support at the 10-day moving average.


Square was recently featured in the IBD Stock Analysis column, which highlights [stocks near a buy point](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-analysis/).


A recent breakout for Universal Display, a leader in state-of-the-art light emitting (OLED) technologies, dimmed as the market pulled back last month. But the stock did not fall more than 7% below the 127.88 entry from a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) base, and has now bounced back into buy range.


Weight loss leader Nutrisystem is working on a third-stage base ahead of its Oct. 25 earnings report. See if Nutrisystem can deliver strong numbers and punch through the entry.


In Q2, LGI Homes rebounded to 45% gain in EPS growth, up from a 9% decline in Q1. Sales growth also spiked, from 0% to 46%. The [highly-rated homebuilder](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) is now extended from a breakout earlier this month.


After moving beyond buy range from its own recent breakout,**Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) is now testing support at its 10-week moving average. If the fitness center operator bounces off that benchmark line in heavy volume, it could offer a buying opportunity.


With the semiconductor sector showing strength, it's not surprising to see several [top chip stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) on the list, including **Ichor** ([ICHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICHR)), **Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)), **Cohu** ([COHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHU)) and **Ultra Clean** ([UCTT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UCTT)).

Don't Miss A Beat
-----------------


The trick to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watch list and action plan. When a company delivers an earnings surprise and breaks out, you want to be there, ready to pounce.


But keep in mind that disappointing numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.


So use screens like the one below as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as we head into the Q3 earnings season.


Also be sure to [run all your stocks through a buying checklist](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IBD_BuyingChecklist.pdf) before you invest, use sound [sell rules](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) and [check overall market conditions](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/).

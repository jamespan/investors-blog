Despite stock market volatility driving sharp swings both up and down, heart valve manufacturer **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) has broken out to new all-time highs. Can rising institutional demand for Edwards Lifesciences stock keep pumping up the share price?




With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), the Irvine, Calif.-based company shares top billing in the medical products [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) with **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)). The group ranks No. 42 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.

Edwards Lifesciences Stock Gaps Up To New All-Time High
-------------------------------------------------------


In 2016, Edwards Lifesciences [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) by undercutting the low in its prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Since then, the stock has been moving higher in [stair-stepping action](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/ai-stocks-to-watch-hubspot-stock-climbs-220-percent/) similar to what we've seen recently in **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)).


After several false or hesitant starts, Edwards Lifesciences launched what looks to be a more decisive [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/) in July. The stock retook a 195.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as it gapped up on earnings to a nearly 10% gain on July 24.


Despite the ongoing stock market volatility, Edwards Lifesciences has shown resilience since the breakout and is so far refusing to [fill the gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/).


The stock is currently [extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). Plus, the current market is "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/)." So now is not an ideal time to make new purchases. But strong technical action and solid institutional demand make Edwards Lifesciences one of the top stocks to watch as we wait to see how current stock market trends play out.


On Friday, Edwards Lifesciences rose nearly 2% to hit a new intraday all-time high.


Repligen stock is in a similar situation. Following an initial breakout that got more decisively underway in June, the stock is now extended. Its relative strength line just below a new high. Repligen has posted two quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth. The stock jumped just under 5% Friday in rising and above-average volume.

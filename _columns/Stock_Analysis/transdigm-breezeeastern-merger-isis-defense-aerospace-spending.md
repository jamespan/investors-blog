Continued unrest in the Middle East and the rise of ISIS is boosting Pentagon spending on military aircraft. And a pending merger would give **TransDigm Group** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) new inroads into the defense aerospace industry.

  

The Cleveland-based maker of ignition systems, gear pumps and other aerospace components is looking to close its $206 million acquisition of helicopter hoist and winch provider **Breeze-Eastern** ([BZC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZC)) in 2016.

  

As [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/120815-784332-transdigm-moves-up-the-aerospace-food-chain-via-acquisitions.htm) column in IBD noted, the deal could give TransDigm a $100 million lift in sales and expanded access to the defense market, since Breeze-Eastern gets 75% of its revenue from Pentagon-related business.

  

In the past fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, TransDigm spent a collective $1.6 billion on four acquisitions, including PneuDraulics and Telair Cargo Group.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, TransDigm beat estimates and posted accelerating growth for both the top and bottom lines.

  

Analysts expect 18% EPS growth in fiscal 2016, followed by a 12% rise in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

TransDigm's 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership points to institutional demand for the stock.

  

But its 86 Composite Rating is below the 90 or higher score you'd prefer, and puts TransDigm in the No. 8 slot in the Aerospace/Defense group, behind Breeze-Eastern, **Huntington Ingalls** ([HII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HII)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

TransDigm has been a strong and steady climber since breaking out in Aug. 2010, rising over 500% until it began forming its current pattern in August of this year.

  

It's a first-stage cup with handle, since the new low undercut the low in the prior pattern to [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/getting-started-counting-bases/) .

  

Although the stock has pulled back somewhat this week, volume has been below average and lower than prior heavy-volume up days in the base. And the tight, healthy trading in the right side of the pattern indicates quiet buying by fund managers and other large investors.

  

The stock has stayed above the 50-day moving average, and that key benchmark is trying to get back above the 200-day moving average, which is a sign of renewed strength.

  

See if TransDigm can break past the 238.61 buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

  

But also keep a close eye on the general market, since selling pressure in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can make it hard for individual stocks to move up.

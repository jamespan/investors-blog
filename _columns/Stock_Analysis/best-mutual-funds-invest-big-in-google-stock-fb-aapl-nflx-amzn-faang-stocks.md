While the coronavirus pandemic infected Wall Street February to April, the best mutual funds invested over $1 billion each in leading [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). These top money managers also scooped up $1.1 billion worth of Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).




While none of these leaders, including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), remained unscathed during the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), GOOGL stock and the other FAANG stocks have all rebounded to hit or approach all-time highs.


One key element of this resilience has been heavy institutional sponsorship by the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-microsoft-apple-facebook-google-lead-stocks-to-buy-watch/). Over the last three months, 31 leading money managers invested $1.1 billion in GOOGL stock. Plus, an impressive 415 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported a position in the search and [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) leader.


Apple, Netflix and Facebook also joined the billion-dollar club. During the same period, these best mutual funds placed big bets on Apple stock ($2.5 billion from 29 top funds), Netflix stock ($1.3 billion, 35 funds) and Facebook stock ($1.3 billion, 41 funds).


Alphabet is now on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) watchlist.


GOOGL Stock Searches For New Buy Zone
-------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) testing a 52-week high, Alphabet recovered from an earlier dip on Friday, and is now right around 1,415.63 buy point. The stock is showing resilience, while FB stock has also shown strength. GOOGL stock has stayed above its short-term 10-day line as it tries to break out into buy zone.


Since its founding in 1998 and IPO in 2004, Alphabet has ventured well beyond its search engine roots. The company now has more than 110,000 employees worldwide, operating Search, Ads, Maps, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube and Android. With Google Cloud, it's also become a major cloud rival to Amazon and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Through its [Verily](https://verily.com/) subsidiary, Alphabet is also in the life sciences and health care industries, looking to enable faster development, innovative health care advances and deployment at scale. Alphabet also owns self-driving car pioneer [Waymo](https://waymo.com/).


Backed by a range of successful businesses and involved in no shortage of so-called [moonshot projects](https://x.company/), Alphabet is looking to shake off the coronavirus crash and break out to new heights.

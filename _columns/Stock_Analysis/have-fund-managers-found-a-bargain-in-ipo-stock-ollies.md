When **Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) went public last July, it didn’t have the fanfare that surrounds big-buzz IPO stocks like **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) or **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). But it’s now working on its first base, and if a more stable market uptrend emerges, Ollie’s may offer a deal for investors.


**Leader Among Discount Retailers**
-----------------------------------


Founded in 1982, the Pennsylvania-based retailer offers “good stuff for cheap,” selling closeouts and excess inventory at its 203 self-described “semi-lovely” stores in 16 states.


Sales growth has ranged from 13% to 22% over the last seven quarters, while EPS gains have come in between 38% to 40% in the last three reports.


Last month, Ollie’s raised full-year guidance for fiscal 2015, ended Jan. 30. The company expects net sales to increase 19% to $760 million, with comparable-store sales growth of approximately 5.5%. The retailer is scheduled to report earnings in early April.


The stock’s 97 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot within the discount retailers group, behind **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and ahead of **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).


**Fund Managers Like A ‘Bargain’ Too**
--------------------------------------


The stock’s B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.7 up/down volume ratio and rising fund ownership reflect strong demand among large investors.


Also, two typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock: Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) and Wasatch Micro Cap ([WMICX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMICX)).


**Getting A Handle On Its First Base**
--------------------------------------


It’s difficult for any stock to climb in the current market, and Ollie’s has pulled back in recent days. But the potential silver lining is that the stock has added a handle to its first base, creating a 22.63 entry.


Heavy-volume buying in the right side of the pattern confirms institutional demand, which could spark a new run if market conditions improve.

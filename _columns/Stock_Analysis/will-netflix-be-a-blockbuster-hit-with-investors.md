The battle for entertainment dollars is fierce. And today we're going to look at one of the companies at the forefront - **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which was featured in a July 19 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/071813-664256-netflix-spending-for-disney-dreamworks-streaming-services.htm)

  

It lets subscribers stream TV shows and movies directly onto TVs, computers and mobile devices. It operates across a wide range of media so users can get content delivered over the Internet to things like computers, game consoles, smart TVs, digital video and other devices

  

Analysts say Netflix has an edge in video on demand, which is the biggest category of subscription-based video. But it also faces competition from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Hulu and Time Warner's HBO Go.

  

Netflix has also made a bigger push into developing original content with shows like "House of Cards," starring Kevin Spacey. And in May, the fourth season of "Arrested Development" premiered on Netflix

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Earnings growth slowed in late 2011 and 2012 but has been rebounding. Earnings were up 345% last quarter.

  

• Sales growth stood at 20% last quarter. Remember you like to see growth of at least 25%. So watch to see if that improves.

  

• Going forward, analysts predict earnings will climb 414% this year and 121% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx) shows Netflix's 89 Composite Rating is the fourth highest among the 24 stock in its Leisure—Movies & Related industry group.

  

The group as a whole is ranked No. 74 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith chart on this page shows Netflix carved out a cup-shaped base last month, then broke out. It climbed a little, then pulled back.

  

Despite that drop, it didn't fall more than 7% below the ideal buy point in that base, so those who bought in on the breakout and who follow IBD's rules were not forced to sell.

  

Watch see if it can find support near the 50-day moving average line. Or if it goes on to form another base.

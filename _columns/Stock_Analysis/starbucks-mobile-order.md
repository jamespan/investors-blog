An early adopter of mobile payments with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) Pay, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) shows how the Internet of Things can connect customers to their coffee â€” which has Starbucks' stock percolating near a new potential buy point.


Using the coffee giant's [Mobile Order & Pay](http://news.investors.com/business/091515-771078-starbucks-mobile-order-pay-rapid-adoption.htm) technology, customers can order drinks on a smartphone for in-store pick-up.


In August, mobile payments made up an estimated 21.6% of total sales.


Mobile Order & Pay is currently available only on the Apple iPhone, but the technology is set to roll out on **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Android devices later this month.


**Key Fundamentals**


Starbucks has posted two straight quarters of rising earnings growth, with a 24% increase in Q2. Sales growth has come in at 18% in each of the last two reports.


For the full year, analysts see a 20% rise in EPS, followed by an 18% gain in 2016.


The Seattle-based company has a robust 42% return on equity (ROE), helping it earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.


Starbucks' return on equity has made the stock a favorite among institutional investors. The number of funds with a position in Starbucks has been rising in recent quarters. Four typically better-performing mutual funds have a stake in the stock, including **Fidelity Contrafund** and **American Century All Cap Growth** .


**Chart Analysis**


Like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and several other market leaders, Starbucks pulled back sharply during the Aug. 24 market sell-off but quickly rebounded.


It's now working on the right side of a new base with a 59.42 buy point.


Starbucks' Relative Strength line has been nearing new high ground; in other words, the stock is outperforming the general market.

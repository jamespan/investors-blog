MPLX Among The Best Dividend Stocks With Earnings Due
-----------------------------------------------------


In Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, MPLX posted triple-digit earnings growth, albeit based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss. The company continued that rebound into Q2 and Q3 of 2021, posting EPS gains of 14% and 21%, respectively.


With Q4 earnings due next week, analysts expect to see 19% earnings growth for the quarter. Wall Street recently revised estimates higher.


After posting a 136% spike in sales growth in Q1 of this year, revenue growth slowed to 15%, then 14% in Q2 and Q3.


The number of funds with a position in MPLX rose from 132 to 142 last quarter.

With [energy stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) showing power and resilience in the current correction, both MPLX and Marathon Petroleum display rising [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/).Â Both stocks are trading at the top of their buy zones.


MPLX initially cleared a 31.37 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Jan. 11. Earning its spot among the best dividend stocks to watch, MPLX is now trading 3% above that entry. Marathon Petroleum is at the very upper edge of its buy zone after breaking out on Jan. 5.

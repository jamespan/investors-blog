While [today's initial public offering](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medpace-ipo-expected-to-maintain-hot-streak-in-new-issues/) from **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) is garnering attention, fellow clinical development and research stock **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) is trying to break past a new buy point.


With a 93 Composite Rating, PRA Health Sciences earns the No. 1 ranking within the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group, ahead of, **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), **Bio-Techne** ([TECH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECH)), **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) and **Luminex** ([LMNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMNX)). Medpace has not yet been ranked.


The North Carolina-based company is a leading global contract research organization (CRO) and was recently named the "[International Clinical Company Of The Year](http://prahs.com/news/pra-named-international-clinical-company-year/)" for the second straight year.


PRA Health Sciences Vs. Medpace
-------------------------------


Medpace reported a 21% rise in revenue to $106 million for Q2, compared to a 16% gain to $456 million for PRA Health Sciences, which went public in November 2014.


PRA's 18% return on equity tops Medpace's 10% ROE, helping the former generate a three-year EPS growth rate of 130%, with 29% annual revenue growth.


Ahead of today's market debut, IPOboutique.com reported that [Medpace's IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medpace-ipo-expected-to-maintain-hot-streak-in-new-issues/) was "multiple-to-exponentially oversubscribed."


While only time will tell if Medpace becomes a favorite of institutional investors, Wall Street is showing demand for PRA's shares, as indicated by its A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio and six straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Is Resistance Futile Or Fierce?
-------------------------------


From a 20.90 closing price at the end of its first week of trading in November 2014 until the end of July 2015, PRA Health Sciences rose as much as 110%.


Since January of this year, however, the stock has been hitting resistance around 50.


PRA is now working on a cup-shaped pattern with a 51.45 buy point. But the stock may form a handle, which would provide an earlier 50.06 entry.
Two heavy-volume up weeks in the right side of the pattern point -- both with closes near the top of the price range -- are further evidence of institutional demand.


See if PRA Health Sciences can clear the buy point in heavy volume and move decisively above its recent area of resistance.

A technology revolution is sweeping through the credit card and payment processing industry. And **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)) is one top-rated stock cashing in on that change.


The Ohio-based firm handles 18% of U.S. payment transactions and is a key driver of the so-called [EMV migration](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/vantiv-leads-personal-credit-economy/) -- the shift to more secure credit cards embedded with chips using technology developed by Europay, **MasterCard** ([MC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MC)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)).


Vantiv, which also supports NFC (near-field communication)-based payment systems like Apple Pay from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and Android Pay from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), provides payment services to small, medium and large merchants, and produces the physical cards for financial institutions.


Through its newly formed subsidiary Vantiv Integrated Payments, Vantiv recently launched Security Pays 2.0, an initiative to drive adoption of additional security measures to the payments process, including end-to-end encryption, tokenization and EMV.


Boosted by five consecutive quarters of topping earnings estimates, Vantiv holds the No. 1 ranking within the credit card and payment processing industry group, ahead of **Heartland Payment Systems** ([HPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPY)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)).


Vantiv Tests New Buy Point
--------------------------


Vantiv traces its roots back to 1971 but had its [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in March 2012.

Since breaking out of a long consolidation in May 2013, the stock has essentially doubled in price.


It’s now working on a new, more volatile base. One yellow flag is that the down weeks in heavy volume outnumber the up weeks in heavy trading within the base. On the positive side, the relative strength line is in new high ground, and the stock has closed higher for five of the past six weeks.


On Friday, Vantiv tried to clear a 53.56 entry but reversed to close below it. See if the stock can retake the buy point on volume at least 40% above average.

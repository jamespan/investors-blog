As the coronavirus pandemic drives demand for online education and remote learning, **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) studies up on a potential breakout to a fresh all-time high. Chegg stock joins fellow [cloud stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks to watch.




Like **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), Chegg has tapped in to the work-from-home and remote learning boom that emerged this year. Both Chegg stock and Zoom stock have made huge gains since the pandemic has forced people to work and study at home.


Zoom Video rose as much as 799% from January until it started to correct in October. Chegg stock made a 248% run from its March lows through October. Not to be outdone, Digital Turbine stock has rocketed over 1,300% from its bottom in March.


Digital Turbine keeps soaring and is now extended. Zoom stock is trying to regroup and retake its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). But after taking a roller-coaster ride that began in August, Chegg is now setting up for a new breakout.


Cloud computing giant Amazon has also risen sharply since March and is now trying to maintain support at its 10-week line and spark a new move.


Chegg Rises On Remote Learning Trends
-------------------------------------


Founded in 2005, Chegg bills its direct-to-student platform as a "smarter way to student."


Supporting students from high school to college and into their careers, Chegg helps people study more efficiently and save money with online textbooks and other remote learning and tutoring services.


With its 2019 [acquisition of Thinkful](https://investor.chegg.com/Press-Releases/press-release-details/2019/Chegg-to-Acquire-Online-Skills-Based-Learning-Platform-Thinkful-to-Help-Students-Accelerate-their-Path-from-Learning-to-Earning/default.aspx), Chegg is adding affordable online courses focused on the most in-demand technology skills for the next-generation workforce. Courses include software engineering, digital marketing and data analytics.


After at least seven quarters of strong earnings growth ranging from 40% to 157%, Chegg slipped to a 6% decline in EPS growth in the third quarter. But the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has delivered average annual earnings growth of 73% over the last three years. Analysts expect Chegg to post 37% EPS growth in 2020, followed by a 31% increase in 2021.


Sales growth has remained strong and steady, coming in between 26% and 64% over the last eight quarters.


Chegg made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-stocks-to-watch-amzn-amd-tsm-etsy/). Plus, 208 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Chegg stock.


Chegg Stock Preps For Breakout Exam
-----------------------------------


Chegg stock has met resistance around the 90 price level since August. Weathering the volatility quite well, Chegg has retaken its 10-week moving average and is rising toward an all-time high.


The W-shaped action in both its chart and [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) reflect that roller-coaster volatility. The RS line is rising sharply as Chegg stock tries to reach its 90.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup-without-handle base.


So as Zoom stock bases and Amazon stock tests support in its latest consolidation, see if Chegg stock can use remote learning to close in on a new buy zone.


Chegg is now just 2% shy of its the new entry.

With a new stock market uptrend underway, **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) is trying to complete an early-stage base. The global leader in heart valve technology remained relatively immune to the recent mauling of top medical stocks.

  

When Hillary Clinton sent a tweet last month accusing Big Pharma of price gouging, biotech and drug maker stocks like **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) sold off sharply.

  

But mutual fund managers and other professional investors stepped in to support Edwards Lifesciences, pumping it up to a nearly 13% gain last week.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Although earnings growth slowed in Q2, the Irvine, Calif.-based company beat estimates. That kept alive its streak of [topping analyst expectations](http://news.investors.com/072815-763806-edwards-second-quarter-earnings-beat.htm) each quarter going back to at least 2013.

  

Sales growth also came in above estimates. Edwards is expected to report Q3 numbers on Oct. 26.

  

For the full year, analysts see EPS rising 25%, followed by a 10% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Edwards has a solid 20% return on equity, a 20% annual EPS growth rate and a 97 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical criteria.

  

The B Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks. And that demand is further reflected in the rising number of funds with a position in the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Back in May, Edwards Lifesciences [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/getting-started-counting-bases/) when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern, making the [cup-with-handle](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/ibd-investing-show-excerpt-how-to-spot-cup-with-handle-bases/) that it was building a first-stage consolidation.

  

The stock broke out in July, but soon pulled back to start forming its current cup-shaped pattern.

  

After falling during the Aug. 24 flash crash, Edwards rebounded to close the week at the top of its price range, but just below the 10-week line.

  

Note how it did find support along its [second line of defense](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/ibd-investing-show-excerpt-a-stocks-first-and-second-line-of-defense/), the 40-week moving average.

  

While the stock temporarily slipped below that benchmark last week, it rebounded to close almost 13% higher and regain its 10- and 40-week moving averages in heavy volume.

  

The potential buy point in the base is 159.10, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

On Monday, Edwards Lifesciences pulled back and it may go on to create a handle, which takes at least five days to form.

  

If it does, the buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

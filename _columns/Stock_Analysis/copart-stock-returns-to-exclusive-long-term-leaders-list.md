Like a prodigal son returning after falling on hard times, **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) has been welcomed back onto the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list. The vehicle auctions specialist once again stands alongside industry powerhouses like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Fair Isaac** ([FICO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FICO)) and **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) as one of just 12 companies in this exclusive club.




And like a salvaged vehicle ready to get back on the road, Copart stock has now revved up a brand new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).


On Monday, Copart popped past a 51.53 buy point in a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). On Thursday, Copart showed resilience, coming off an early dip to close in positive territory. On Friday, the stock rose again, closing the week 4% past that entry. Copart remains within the optimal buy range — up to 5% above the initial buy point.


Copart was featured [in January ahead of that breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/copart-stock-new-another-breakout-after-eye-popping-11-year-gain/) and as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/copart-stock-of-the-day-rebounds-brings-ai-to-online-car-auctions/) on Feb. 13. Its latest run builds on the remarkable climb that originally earned it a spot alongside Microsoft and others on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list.


Shares of Copart have now soared as much as 11,945% from its lows in 2003. That includes the 110% jump the stock has made since coming off the lows it hit in June of 2022.


In a clear sign of demand, heavy volume kicked in before and after Copart reported earnings earlier this month, once again securing its spot among the IBD Long-Term Leaders.


Fellow long-term leader Microsoft bounced off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) Thursday in above-average and rising volume. The software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence giant moved farther above that benchmark on Friday.

Copart Posts Over $1 Billion In Quarterly Sales — Again
-------------------------------------------------------


On Feb. 22, Copart [reported earnings](https://www.copart.com/content/us/en/press-releases/copart-reports-second-quarter-2024-results) for the fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 31. For the third time in the last three quarters, the company has driven revenue north of $1 billion. In its latest report, Copart posted $1.02 billion, marking a 7% gain over the prior-year quarter.


Earnings-per-share growth rose 10% to 33 cents a share. For the current fiscal year, analysts forecast 14% EPS growth, followed by a 12% gain in fiscal 2025.


Triumphant Return To Long-Term Leaders
--------------------------------------


In late November of 2021, Copart stock entered a long slump, ultimately forming a 65-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). During that time, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) consistently lagged the S&P 500. While still shy of its 52-week high, the RS line for Copart has perked up.


Copart maintains a strong [Earnings Stability Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/earnings-growth-is-essential-but-better-when-its-also-steady-heres-how-to-find-it/) — a key component of IBD Long-Term Leaders. Unlike the higher-is-better [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), the lower a company's Earnings Stability Rating, the more stable the earnings. Copart's score of 6 ties that of four other long-term leaders, including Microsoft and FICO stock.


**Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) and **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) sport an even-stronger Earnings Stability Rating of 3.


Copart also continues to display solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/before-buying-stocks-check-the-institutional-ownership/). In addition to a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/), 64 funds with an A+ from IBD own shares of CPRT stock. Copart also earns a 1.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Any number above 1.0 points to demand.

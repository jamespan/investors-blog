 A good starting point for finding winning stocks is to see what top fund managers are buying. And 24 funds with an A+ rating have their eyes — and money — on **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)).
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ([FBGRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBGRX)) and Profunds Ultra Mid Cap ([UMPIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMPIX)) are among the leading funds with a position in the maker of fiber optic lasers and amplifiers for the materials processing, automotive, medical and measurement markets.


Industry giant Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), which has an A rating, holds approximately 1.5% of IPG's outstanding shares.

An A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership further confirm demand for the stock.


Fund managers have also taken an interest in the Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group as whole, which currently ranks No. 18 among the 197 groups tracks.


Industry leaders **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)), **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) and IPG each earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.


Q4 Earnings Pop
---------------


IPG Photonics posted accelerating growth in Q4, as earnings gains jumped from 9% to 26% and sales growth rose from 9% to 25%.


Earnings estimates for this year and 2018 were both recently revised higher to 14%.


Boosted by a 36.4% pretax profit margin and 18.5% return on equity, IPG scores an A SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE.


Laser-Focused Flat Base
-----------------------


Since clearing a 32-week long [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-cup-with-handle) at the end of last year, IPG Photonics has been moving steadily higher.


It's currently working on a second-stage flat base with a 124.37 buy point.



Trading within the pattern has been tight and the stock is now testing support at the 10-week moving average while its Relative Strength line floats near new high ground.


On Monday, IPG fell 1% in rising, but below-average volume. In a sign of support, it rebounded enough to close above its 10-day line. The stock closed down fractionally Tuesday in light volume, staying within its recent narrow trading range.


See if IPG Photonics can cut a clear path through the buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

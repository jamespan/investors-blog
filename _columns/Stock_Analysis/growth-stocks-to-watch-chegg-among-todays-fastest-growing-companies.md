Education stock **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) is not only one of today's top growth stocks to watch. It's also offering an innovative way for its own employees to pay off student loans.




In June, Chegg announced its [Equity for Education](https://investor.chegg.com/Press-Releases/press-release-details/2019/Chegg-reveals-first-of-its-kind-equity-plan-to-help-its-US-employees-pay-off-their-student-debt/default.aspx) program, which created an equity pool from its existing pool of company stock. Funds will be used to help [pay off student loans](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/8-tips-for-millennials-tackling-student-loan-debt/) for its U.S. employees.


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, which went public in 2013, sees the program as an innovative model that other organizations can use to lower their own employees' student debt.

Growth Stocks To Watch: Chegg Keeps Chugging Ahead
--------------------------------------------------


With annual average EPS growth of 128% over the last three years, Chegg is among the top [growth stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/).


Other highly rated companies with impressive annual EPS growth rates include **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) (224%), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) (198%), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) (185%), **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) 170%), and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) (149%).


Chegg's explosive growth has helped earn it the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). Leading [Chinese education stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) also share that honor.


In addition to earnings growth, Chegg also has a proven track record of solid top-line gains. The provider of textbook rentals, tutoring and other education services has generated revenue gains ranging from 17% to 32% over the last six quarters.


Signs of institutional demand for Chegg stock include a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-look-for-solid-accumulation-in-a-base/), 1.2 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership. But note that the number of funds with a position in stock fell last quarter. Look for that to reverse in the coming weeks and months.


Education Tech Stock Launches New Breakout
------------------------------------------


As many of the [best IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/ipo-stocks-uber-zoom-beyond-meat-headhunter-sonim/) do, Chegg stock got off to a slow start from its November 2013 market debut. It wasn't until February 2016 that it established a bottom and began to rise. And it wasn't until March 2017 that it broke out from a sound [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) to launch an impressive new run.


From that breakout, Chegg rose 396% over the next two years before pulling back to form its current base.


During that run, Chegg was featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/online-education-stocks-to-watch-chegg/) on Dec. 19, 2018, while establishing a 32.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock went on to clear that entry, launching a 27% gain in just over two months before pulling back.


On Monday, Chegg cleared a second-stage base with a 41.79 buy point. More aggressive investors might see 40.74 as an earlier entry.


The stock gave back a portion of its big move, but still managed to rise 5.5% to close at 42.79, 3% above its buy point. Preliminary volume came in 165% higher than normal. Chegg remains within range, which extends to 43.88.

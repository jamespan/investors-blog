Today we'll check back in on **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which we last featured on [Jan. 23](http://education.investors.com/daily-stock-analysis/012314-687351-will-new-superchargers-give-tesla-motors-a-fresh-jolt-.aspx).

  

Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Palo Alto, CA, Tesla makes luxury electric vehicles, with the goal of developing a fleet of 100% electric cars that make it practical for motorists to leave gasoline behind.

  

Its current model S sedan starts at $70,000, but they're working on a more mid-priced vehicle to debut in early 2015 for around $40,000. Tesla also plans to add a sports utility vehicle and roadster to its growing electric fleet.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Quarterly earnings growth has remained strong, with triple-digit gains in its last four quarters. But keep in mind that those gains are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed no earnings.

  

• Although its latest report shows a dip in sales growth, it was still showing triple-digit strength of 101%.

  

• After a year of exceptional growth, Tesla's 2014 earnings and sales numbers will have tougher comparisons to beat. So watch to see if it can sustain that triple-digit growth when it reports Q1 numbers on May 5.

  

• For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 131% in 2014, followed by a 114% gain in 2015.

  

• The number of funds that own the stock has continued to increase, rising from 687 funds to 714 in Q1.

  

• Three typically better-performing funds have reported a position in Tesla: Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX), Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), and CGM Focus Fund (CGMFX).

  

• The Up/Down Volume Ratio of 1.2 indicates demand. 

  

• Tesla's strong 26% return on equity helps it earn an A SMR Rating. 

  

• Overall, the stock scores a solid 97 Composite Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

When we last covered Tesla in the on Jan. 23, it was nearing a 194.60 buy point in a deep cup-shaped base.

  

It broke out three weeks later, rising as much as 36% in just three weeks before starting to pull back.

  

The stock has since come back down to its 10-week line, but note how weekly volume was below-average — a positive sign that institutional investors were not selling aggressively.

  

It's the first bounce off that benchmark line since the earlier breakout, which means it could serve as a potential add-on opportunity.

  

It's also possible Tesla will go on to form a new base. If it does, it would be a third-stage formation. Such later-stage patterns can deliver good gains, but are riskier than first- or second-stage bases.

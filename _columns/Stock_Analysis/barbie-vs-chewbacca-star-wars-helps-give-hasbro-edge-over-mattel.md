The two titans of toys have a well-established rivalry, but the Force has helped awaken a resurgence in **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)), while Barbie and Hot Wheels have failed to rev up overall numbers for **Mattel** ([MAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAT)).


In addition to an electronic Chewbacca mask and other Star Wars toys, Hasbro’s brands also include Transformers, My Little Pony, Monopoly, Magic: The Gathering and others. 


The popularity -- and profitability -- of its products have driven demand for Hasbro’s stock, which is currently trading just below a new buy zone. 


**Rating The Rivals**
---------------------


Hasbro has been outperforming Mattel in virtually all the most important fundamental criteria:


* Last three quarters average EPS growth: Hasbro (34%), Mattel (-23%)
* EPS % change last quarter: Hasbro (81%), Mattel (-63%)
* Sales % change last quarter: Hasbro (16%), Mattel (-6%)
* Return on equity: Hasbro (28.4%), Mattel (15.5%)
* Annual pretax profit margin: Hasbro (13.4%), Mattel (9.9%)


Hasbro also earns a 98 Composite Rating, meaning it’s outperforming 98% of all stocks. Mattel scores a 62.


**Toying With New Buy Point**
-----------------------------


Hasbro reset its base count last August, and then broke out of a first-stage consolidation in April.


Since it pulled back to begin forming a new consolidation before rising at least 20%, its current flat base is considered part of a longer base-on-base formation. 


The buy point is 88.63, and the stock has been finding support along the 10-week line as it nears that entry. 


Also note how that benchmark line climbed back above the 40-week moving average in April, a sign of renewed technical strength.

The highly ranked enterprise software industry group includes many top-rated and fast-growing companies, including **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)). Another stock to watch is **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)).









 
 
 Driven by recent breakouts from Salesforce.com, Workday, RingCentral and Paycom, the group ranks No. 5 out of the [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/understanding-the-link-between-industry-groups-and-institutional-investors/), up from No. 38 six weeks ago.
On Thursday and Friday, Salesforce added to its run following a [strong earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-com-quarterly-earnings-revenue-beat-shares-rise/), closing the week with a gain of 6%. The stock was off around 1.6% in early trading Monday. Paycom opened the week adding marginally to its 4% gain on Friday, putting it 19% above its 86.20 entry.


Early Monday, Upland Software, which went public in November 2014, followed the lead of its industry peers and launched its own breakout move.


Triple-Digit Earnings Growth
----------------------------


Based in Austin, Texas, Upland Software provides cloud-based work management software, with more than 2,500 customers and over 250,000 users around the world.


In November, [Upland announced it was acquiring Qvidian](https://investor.uplandsoftware.com/2017-11-17-Upland-Software-Announces-Largest-Acquisition-to-Date-Raises-Guidance?_ga=2.213823888.561415523.1519835880-1094109959.1519835880), a leading provider of request-for-proposal and sales-proposal automation software.


At the time of the announcement, Upland said the deal would immediately add $19.5 million in annualized revenue to the company's top line.

Although that's a mere rounding error for a company like Salesforce.com, which just reported [$10.48 billion in revenue for fiscal 2018](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-com-quarterly-earnings-revenue-beat-shares-rise/)Â and forecast fiscal 2019 revenue of $12.6 billion to $12.65 billion, it's significant for Upland, which had $26.1 million in sales in Q3.


Upland Software has generated triple-digit earnings growth in each of the last six reports. However, three of those were based on comparisons with year-over-year quarters that showed a loss.


The company is scheduled to report Q4 numbers on March 8, with analysts expecting a 125% rise in EPS growth.


On the downside, Upland's 9.1% annual pretax profit margin and 8.3% return on equity earn failing grades in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2354661). By comparison, Paycom Software sports a 27% profit margin and 61% ROE.


Forming Long Cup With Handle
----------------------------


Upland Software has been working on a 31-week-long cup with handle with a 25.10 buy point. Some investors might use 24.28 as an earlier entry, but given the [increase in selling pressure in the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/trumps-tariffs-sock-the-stock-market-as-outlook-changes/), now is a time to be more cautious than aggressive.



Signs of institutional demand for shares include a 1.5 up/down volume ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and five quarters of rising fund ownership.


In a sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day line has climbed back above the longer-term 50-day moving average.


Upland Software's relative strength line has been moving up, and is within striking distance of new high ground.


With a gain of over 7% early Monday in massive volume, the stock is now trading at the upper end of the buy range, which extends to 26.36.


But keep in mind that Upland Software reports earnings on March 8, and it can be risky to buy a stock just before it announces its latest quarterly numbers.

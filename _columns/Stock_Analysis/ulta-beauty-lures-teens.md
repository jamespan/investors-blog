After shaking off the Aug. 24 mini flash crash, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) has settled in a tight range as it nears a potential buy zone. The cosmetics retailer has used its popular ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program and "authentic indie" brands like Urban Decay to attract teens and [steal market share](http://news.investors.com/101415-775553-ulta-sephora-gain-beauty-share-cvs-target.htm) from **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and other general stores.

  

Ulta opened 20 new locations in Q2 to bring its total count to 817 stores in 48 states. For fiscal 2015, which ends Jan. 31, 2016, Ulta plans to unveil 100 net new stores.

  

E-commerce is another growth catalyst. In fiscal 2014, online sales grew 56%, followed by a 43% year-over-year rise in Q2. Ulta aims to grow e-commerce revenue from 5% of total sales last year to 19% by 2019.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Over the past six quarters, sales growth has ranged from 19% to 22%, while earnings have risen between 18% and 35%. Fiscal Q3 earnings are expected Dec. 3.

  

While the specialty-retail industry group ranked a lowly No. 129 in Friday's IBD, Ulta is the clear leader among its peers, earning "Best in Group" scores for its EPS, SMR, Accumulation/Distribution and Composite Ratings.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base last October, Ulta has climbed in tight trading, finding support along its 10-week moving average.

  

The only significant break in that trend was during the week of the Aug. 24 sell-off. But the stock quickly recovered to close just below that benchmark line.

  

If you exclude that anomaly, which affected most stocks, the depth in Ulta's current base is 13%, putting it within the normal 10% to 15% decline in a flat base.

  

While the traditional buy point is 176.87, more aggressive investors could target an earlier 170.31 entry.

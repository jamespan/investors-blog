**Netgear** ([NTGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTGR)) is trading in the vicinity of a 43.77 buy point after clearing that level last week.

  

The stock's latest entry point comes from a flat base that began to take shape in early May 1. An alternative buy point existed at 43.08, based on the level of resistance created in early June.

  

Netgear found support along its 10-week moving average as it formed its base. It also maintained support around 38, the level from where it broke out of on April 29.

  

It broke out past 43.77 on June 28 in daily volume that was 31% above average, a little below the level that you prefer to see. But turnover came in strong on June 30 (46% above average), as the stock remained near 43.77.

  

Netgear hasn't managed to advance much since its breakout, and it also has traded below its recent buy point 2. But it hasn't triggered any sell rules either.

  

As a June 23 New America article noted, Netgear is a leading maker of home networking equipment. The Silicon Valley firm recently rolled out a new line of Wi-Fi boosters, devices that let you expand the reach of your existing wireless router that covers your house.

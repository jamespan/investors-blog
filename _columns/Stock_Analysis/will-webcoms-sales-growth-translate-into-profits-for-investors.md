There are three ways a business can increase sales: increase the number of customers, increase the amount of money those customers spend or buy other businesses.

  

And **Web.com Group** ([WWWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWWW)) has done all three.

  

It provides Internet services for small- and mid-sized businesses. The firm registers domain names and also offers social media marketing and other services.

  

And as a [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/031513-648188-webcom-sales-and-subscribers-keep-rising.htm) in Monday's paper noted, it's been adding new subscribers — topping the 3-million-subscriber mark last year for the first time.

  

Once subscribers have signed up, the next step is to sell them added-value products so Web.com can increase its average revenue per user.

  

To do that, it cross sells higher-priced products like it's eWorks Do It For Me subscription, which includes everything from registering domain names to designing websites to providing technical support and social media training.

  

And analysts say that's what sets the company apart from competitors who give users the tools, but have them do such things themselves.

  

Web.com has also been acquiring other companies, including Network Solutions in 2011.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• And those efforts have boosted sales, which grew at a triple-digit pace during the first three quarters of 2012 before cooling to a still-respectable 51% last quarter.

  

• Earnings growth ranged from 41% to 67% during the past four quarters.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts see earnings rising 25% in 2013 and 18% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

Now let's see how the stock scores in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-webcom-group-inc-wwww.aspx). Web.com's Composite Rating is only 62. Typically you want to see a Composite Rating of at least 80.

  

And the box on the right side of Stock Checkup shows other companies in the Internet-Network Solutions industry group that have higher Composite Ratings.

  

They include **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)), which helps people tap into their company's computer networks and **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)), which offers web-based IT management software.

  

Also, the industry group itself is only ranked No. 187 among IBD's 197 groups. So it hasn't been one of the market's stronger performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

We featured this stock in the [Daily Stock Analysis video](http://ibdtv.investors.com/daily-stock-analysis/644462-daily-stock-analysis-webcom.aspx) in Feb. Back then it was forming a base, as you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart above. Since then it's added a handle to that pattern.

  

To calculate the potential buy point on this base, just add 10 cents to the peak in that handle. That makes the ideal buy point 18.57.

  

Watch to see if the stock can climb past that buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average. If it does it could create a buying opportunity.

Today we'll look at **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), which just went public in April.

  

The company provides an online and mobile platform that connects independent restaurants across the U.S. with people ready to order for pickup or delivery.

  

Customers can easily search for local eateries, check the online menus, then place and track their orders through GrubHub's system.

  

The company's objective is to connect local restaurants with diners in approximately 600 cities.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has accelerated in each of the last four quarters, with triple-digit gains in Q4 and Q1. GrubHub's earnings growth has also exceeded 100% in each of the last two quarters.

  

Analyst expecting annual earnings to rise 313% in 2014 and 30% next year.

  

The stock's Composite Rating of 75 is below the 95 or higher score you'd prefer to see, but it's not unusual for a brand-new IPO to have a relatively low grade. See if that rating continues to rise.

  

GrubHub's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is an A-, indicating heavy institutional buying in recent weeks. It also has a strong Up/Down Volume Ratio of 2.6, another sign of demand. Since the stock's April debut, one typically better-performing fund has reported a position in the stock:Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith chart on this page, GrubHub is currently working on its first base.

  

As it was forming the bottom of the cup, it found support around the $30 mark, and had three weeks of tight closes. That laid the foundation from which the stock started to build the right side of the pattern.

  

Although the Relative Strength Line has slipped lower this week, it had been generally trending upward as GrubHub moved back toward its old high, a sign the stock was outperforming the overall market.

  

The stock has been pulling back in recent days, and may end up creating a handle. If that happens, the ideal buy point would be 39.22, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

If the base becomes a cup-without-handle, the ideal buy point would be 40.90, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

The stock has not been trading long enough to establish either a 10-week moving average line or an average daily volume. That's a reminder of why new IPOs can be risky. There's not a lot of trading history to guide you.

  

But GrubHub does have many of the CAN SLIM traits you look for in a stock: An innovative service, strong earnings growth and signs of institutional demand. So watch to see if it can complete its current base and break out on heavy volume.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-grubhub-inc-grub.aspx) shows that GrubHub's Computer â€” Integrated Systems industry group ranks a lowly 166 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

But among its peers, GrubHub scores a Best in Group ranking for its 75 Composite Rating and A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

Today we're going to look at **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), which specializes in treatments for narcolepsy and rare diseases.

  

In 2012, the company merged with Azure Pharma and moved its tax domicile to Ireland. Analysts say that shift has given Jazz more room to grow.

  

The lower corporate tax rate has reportedly helped the company maximize its cash flow and make acquisitions.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The company's earnings growth accelerated the past two quarters, coming in most recently at 43%.

  

Meanwhile, sales growth ranged from 26% to 40% to during the past four quarters.

  

Jazz is due to report third-quarter results Nov. 3.

  

For the full year, analysts see earnings climbing 30% and they also predict a 23% increase next year.

  

Mutual funds and hedge funds own about 69% of the company's shares.

  

But you'll also notice the number of funds owning the stock has slipped in recent quarters. Ideally, you'd like to see that rising.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Jazz broke out of a nine-week cup-with-handle base last month.

  

But then, as the market headed south Jazz followed suit and briefly dipped 9% below the ideal buy point. And that forced those who bought in the on the breakout — and who follow IB's rules — to sell.

  

On the upside, the stock did find support at the 50-day moving average line that day. And it also found support at that benchmark line this week.

  

So watch to see if the stock can rebound up from that line on heavy volume.

  

If that happens and the market is in an uptrend, it could provide a buying opportunity.

  

But for now, with the market in a correction, it may just be one to add to your watch list.

After Louis Vuitton owner **LVMH Moet Hennessy** ([LVMUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVMUY)) entered a new buy zone Wednesday, fellow apparel stock **PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)) is trying to fashion a new breakout move of its own.




PVH, which owns leading clothing brands Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands, ties [leading 2017 IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) for the No. 1 spot among apparel manufacturing stocks. The group itself ranks No. 25 among IBD's 197 groups.


Four Quarters Of Rising Earnings Growth
---------------------------------------


PVH is one of the largest apparel companies in the world, with nearly $9 billion in sales in 2017. Growth has been driven by acquisitions, including Calvin Klein in 2003, Tommy Hilfiger in 2010 and Warnaco in 2013.


By contrast, LVMH posted 42.6 billion euros in revenue last year (approximately $52.4 billion at current exchange rates).


Canada Goose, which makes premium outerwear, is much smaller than PVH or LVMH, but the [IPO Leaders stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) has been growing revenue at a 38% annual clip over the last three years.


PVH has also been growing nicely in recent quarters, posting accelerating earnings growth in each of the last four reports. Sales growth jumped from 5% two quarters ago to 19% in its most recently reported quarter.


26 Top Mutual Funds Buy Shares
------------------------------


PVH made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-stocks-to-watch-adobe-abiomed-constellation-brands/) over the last three months. Twenty-six top funds invested approximately $50.6 million in the stock. LVMH also earned a spot on the list.


Other signs of institutional demand for PVH include a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio.


Can PVH Design Stylish Breakout?
--------------------------------


On March 29, PVH gapped up to a more than 5% gain after reporting earnings. The stock has shown resilience since then and is now testing a 158.06 buy point in a flat base.


On Thursday, PVH rose 2.6%,  pushing it into the buy zone, which extends to 165.92. As you like to see on the day of a breakout, the relative strength line hit a new 52-week high. Volume was 40% higher than normal.


But on Friday, PVH fell nearly 3%, pushing it back below the entry as the major stock indexes retreated from recent gains. The stock did manage to come off the day's lows and volume was lower than on recent up days.



LVMH climbed past a 63.30 buy point on Wednesday, but volume was 41% below average. Ideally, you'd see a 40% or greater rise in trading on the day of a breakout to show conviction for the move. On Thursday, the luxury goods maker rose 1.6% in rising but below-average volume. On Friday, LVMH was down 1%, but showing resilience by remaining in the buy zone, which extends to 66.47.


Meanwhile, Canada Goose is again testing support at its 50-day line. The Toronto-based stock is now 11% below a 38.35 entry in a later-stage consolidation.


Keep in mind that since we're still in a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) it's risky to make any new stock buys right now. But do continue to build your list of [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), with an eye on those like PVH, Canada Goose and LMVH that are forming bases that could launch new breakout moves in the next market rally.

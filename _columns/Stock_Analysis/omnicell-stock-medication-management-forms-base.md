**Omnicell** ([OMCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMCL)) provides medication management systems for hospitals, health care systems and pharmacies. Now the question is, can it provide a fresh breakout for investors?




In the face of stock market volatility, Omnicell is showing resilience. It has found support at its 10-week moving average and its relative strength line is floating just below a new high.


Keep in mind that most stocks follow the direction of the general market. So when the current outlook is "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)," as it is now, most individual stocks will encounter the same headwinds. That's why it's best to be careful about making any new buys in this environment.

Omnicell Delivers 130% EPS Growth, But Slowing
----------------------------------------------


Founded in 1992, Omnicell leverages predictive intelligence, robotics and cloud applications to deliver medications more safely and affordably. Its central pharmacy automation solutions help pharmacies and hospitals reduce both inventory and the time it takes to produce the medications.


Omnicell has delivered average earnings growth of 130% over the last three quarters. But gains have slowed during that period, from 314% in Q1 to 37% in Q3. Note, however, that Omnicell's Q3 earnings beat consensus analyst estimates by 12.5%.


On another positive note, analysts recently raised earnings estimates for this year and 2019 to 45% and 19%, respectively.


With a 96 Composite Rating, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company shares the No. 3 spot in the Medical equipment industry group with **Hill-Rom** ([HRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRC)), **Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)) and **Steris** ([STE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STE)).


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) earns top billing with a 98 Composite Rating. **IRadimed** ([IRMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRMD)) comes in second with a 97.


As you like to see, the group ranks within the top 40 of the 197 groups IBD tracks. It's now at No. 34, up from No. 37 on Thursday.


Signs of institutional demand for Omnicell stock include a 1.2 up/down volume ratio, A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Omnicell Stock: Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead?
--------------------------------------------


Omnicell is working on a second-stage consolidation showing a 73.10 buy point. The stock briefly cleared that entry on Nov. 7 and 8, but quickly fell back below it. Volume on the first three days of pullback was below average, a sign that large investors were not selling aggressively. But it spiked higher Wednesday as the stock fell another 1%.


On Thursday, the stock dropped early but found support at its 50-day line and rebounded to a 2.5% gain to 70.95. Volume was below average. The stock added another 2.6% Friday to close the week at 72.82, just below the entry. Volume was above average and higher than the day before.


Keep a close eye on that [price-volume relationship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/price-volume-1/). it will help reveal how aggressive any buying and selling actually is.


In early trading Monday, the stock initially jumped back into buy zone, but then retreated. It's currently around 1% below the entry.

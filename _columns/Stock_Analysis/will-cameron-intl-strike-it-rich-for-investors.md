As companies move into deeper ocean waters drilling for oil and gas, **Cameron International's** ([CAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAM)) expertise is a good fit.

  

The firm makes underwater pressure control, drilling and compression equipment. And it was profiled in a Mar. 20 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/031913-648543-cameron-international-deep-sea-oil-drilling.htm).

  

Analysts say even though volatile oil prices can impact business at some oil and gas companies, companies like Cameron that provide services and equipment to the industry are largely unaffected.

  

That's because the projects they work on are less susceptible to temporary price weaknesses.

  

And you can see that demand for Cameron's products and services in its backlog, which was up 43% in 2012 from the year before.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Sales growth ranged from 18% to 32% the past four quarters.

  

• Earnings growth has been accelerating, though at 23% last quarter it's still a little short of the 25% percent minimum typically seen in leading stocks.

  

• Still, those earnings have been consistent and that helps it score an 8 Earnings Stability Rating. That rating gauges how consistent a company's earnings have been in recent years. And the lower the reading, the better.

  

• Analysts see that growth continuing and predict earnings will climb 24% this year and 30% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cameron-intl-corp-cam.aspx) shows Cameron's 93 Composite Rating is the group's second highest, so it's one of the leaders.

  

Only **Geospace Technologies**  ([GEOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEOS)) has a higher rating. It makes seismic instruments and other equipment for the oil industry.

  

The industry group itself is ranked No. 49 among IBD's 197 industries.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the daily chart above from our sister company MarketSmith, Cameron carved out a flat base.

  

It tried to break out of that pattern earlier this month, but didn't get far.

  

Since then it's pulled back and in recent days, the stock's been finding support at the 50-day moving average line. So watch to see if it can bounce up from it.

  

If that happens the potential buying area would be as close to the 50-day as possible once volume starts to kick in.

  

So this may be one to keep on your watch list.

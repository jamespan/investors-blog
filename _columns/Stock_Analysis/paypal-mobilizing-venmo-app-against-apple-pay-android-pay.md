From Apple Pay and Android Pay to Pay With Amazon and Alipay from Chinese e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), online payments pioneer **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) has no shortage of well-heeled rivals.


The San Jose, CA-based firm, which went public last July after splitting off from **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), has used strategic acquisitions to push back against **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and other competitors, particularly in the mobile payments space.


Last March, PayPal announced it was acquiring Paydiant, which worked with **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) and other large retailers within the Merchant Customer Exchange to develop the CurrentC payments app.


PayPal followed that with its July purchase of Xoom, which enables digital international money transfers.


And back in 2013, PayPal paid $800 million for Braintree, adding the startup’s Venmo digital payment app to its lineup.


Popular among millennials, Venmo has shown explosive growth and looks to be a key driver of PayPal’s mobile expansion.


Consumers transferred $1 billion through the app in January, more than double the volume in January 2015 and more than a 10-fold increase over January 2014.


Will “New Money” Drive New Growth?
----------------------------------


At this year’s Super Bowl, PayPal ran ads featuring its New Money vs. Old Money campaign. And its five-year 38% annual EPS growth rate reveals a solid track record of cashing in on digital payments. But its three-year growth rate is a more tepid 16%, so PayPal’s ability to expand and monetize the free Venmo app will be a key trend to watch.


Analysts expect PayPal’s earnings to rise 15% this year, followed by an 18% rise in 2017. Estimates for both years have recently been revised downward, so see if that trend reverses.


Although the stock’s current Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a lowly D-, over 1700 funds have established a position in PayPal, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).


Will PayPal’s IPO Base Pay Off?
-------------------------------


Since its disappointing debut in July, PayPal has been working on its first base. Although it resembles the shape of a double bottom, it doesn’t qualify as one because the second leg down did not undercut the low in the first leg down.

The buy point 42.65, ten cents above the peak on the left.


Trading has been wide and loose, at least partially a reflection of volatility in the general market. On the positive side, the Relative Strength line has been floating near new high ground.


Look for trading to tighten up in the right side of the base. Also, see if PayPal can flash signs of accumulation, such has a string of up weeks on above-average volume, as it tries to close in on a potential buy zone.

After reporting accelerating earnings and sales growth on Tuesday, **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) drove a nearly 8% gain in heavy volume. Now auto parts rival **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) is trying to rev up its own buy zone. ORLY stock cleared a buy point the same day AZO stock made its big move.




As used car prices and inflation rise, auto parts retailers continue to show strength. Since the pandemic lows in March 2020, AutoZone has cruised as much as 196% higher. O'Reilly Automotive, with its consumer-facing flagship brand O'Reilly Auto Parts, has jumped 170%.


**Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), which is now extended from a September [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), has gained as much as 232% during the same period.

O'Reilly Automotive In Highly Ranked Auto Parts Retailers Group
---------------------------------------------------------------


O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts join **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **LKQ** ([LKQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LKQ)) among the top-ranked leaders in the auto parts industry. The group ranks No. 9 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


In a sign of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/), O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone both made the most recent list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-aapl-nvda-msft-googl-crm/). Helping drive that demand, O'Reilly Automotive has posted average annual earnings growth of 25% over the last three years. That edges out the 23% average annual growth for AutoZone.


O'Reilly sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


ORLY Stock Test Drives Buy Zone
-------------------------------


On Dec. 6, ORLY stock briefly cleared a 669.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). On Wednesday, the stock showed resilience, coming off lows and was up for the week. O'Reilly remains in [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), now trading about 2% above the initial entry.


Showing stock market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for O'Reilly Automotive remains around its 52-week high.


Reflecting the solid demand among leading money managers, the stock has generally stayed above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) since retaking that benchmark in April 2020.


With O'Reilly Automotive trading in a buy zone and just below a new all-time high, see if the stock can ride out the stock market correction and continue its upward momentum.

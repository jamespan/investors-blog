Celgene has pulled back as the market has come under increased selling pressure, but the long-term prospects for the biotech leader remain healthy.

  

**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) develops cancer and immune-inflammatory-related disease therapies, including multiple myeloma treatment Revlimid, which generates around 65% of total revenue.

  

The New Jersey-based firm is reported to have the most products in phase three and phase two trials among fellow biotech drugmakers, such as **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)).

  

In June, Celgene inked a [$1 billion deal with **Juno Therapeutics**](http://news.investors.com/investing-ibd-industry-themes/070115-759886-juno-celgene-lead-biotechs-near-buy-point.htm) ([JUNO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JUNO)), giving it the option to license Juno's chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell cancer therapies.

  

Celgene also has the option to buy up to 30% of Juno stock.

  

Then in July, the [IBD Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm) member announced a $7.2 billion purchase of **Receptos** ([RCPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCPT)), which develops treatments for multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

In Q2, earnings rose 37% and sales climbed 22%. Both came in above estimates.

  

Celgene also said that it's targeting $21 billion in sales in 2020 â€” more than double the $9 billion it expects this year.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After breaking out in June 2014, Celgene rose over 50% before starting to form its latest consolidation in March.

  

It shot out of that base in July on news of the Receptos acquisition. Since then, it's pulled back below its 10-week moving average.

  

While a stronger uptrend may need to emerge before Celgene can head higher again, an impressive product pipeline, solid earnings growth, recent acquisitions and the continued strength of Revlimid mean that it's one to keep an eye on.

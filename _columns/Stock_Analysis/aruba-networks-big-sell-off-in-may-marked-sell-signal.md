Add **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) to the list of leading stocks flashing sell signals.

  

The stock plunged below its 10-week moving average on May 20 1, the day after the company reported its earnings.

  

Investors didn't seem to like the guidance Aruba gave with its quarterly results. The fact that the market was in a correction also didn't help.

  

On May 20, traders sent the stock tumbling 17%. Volume jumped to the highest level in months 2. That was a sure sign that institutional investors fled the stock.

  

Whether you agree with the market's reaction or not, it's important not to argue with it. Just watch what the stock is telling you. Aruba's heavy-volume drop below the 10-week line — a level where it had found support earlier — was a key sell signal.

  

Another warning sign was that the drop was the biggest since it started its price run.

  

In the days since then, Aruba has found support near its 200-day moving average 3. This is no guarantee that the stock will bounce back, given the large amount of selling lately.

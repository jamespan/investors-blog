The future of AI could be a [Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/). And that has **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) within spitting distance of a new buy point. Riding the [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/generative-ai-battle-forms-should-big-tech-control-its-path/) boom and a turnaround in its advertising business, Meta stock has leveraged the metaverse to land a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) as a breakout nears.




[Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/) has also earned a home on the IBD Leaderboard list, as well as the IBD 50 and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


Now if the market indexes cooperate, the Facebook parent and fellow [AI](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-news/) cohorts like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) may shake off pressure and resume their climbs.


Even as the market works its way through turbulence, Meta stock joined Nvidia and Google on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-smart-money-investors-pour-billions-into-just-stocks/).


As the table below shows, Meta stock sports an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/). Its 1.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) further points to demand. After retreating Friday, Meta closed the week 8% below a 326.20 buy point in a second-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle).


Meta Stock VS. Other Top-Rated AI Names
---------------------------------------


As [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) builds on its recent climb, [Amazon stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-climbs-as-company-seeks-to-rekindle-growth-improve-profits/) continues to tease a breakout of its own as it brings its [cloud playbook to shipping](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-new-supply-chain-product-follows-aws-playbook/). But Amazon slipped below its buy point and 50-day line on Friday.


Meanwhile, Meta stock, Microsoft and Nvidia are all testing support at their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Not coincidentally, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow are doing the same. All the major indexes, as well as Meta, Nvidia and Microsoft, closed the week below below their 50-day lines.


In addition to decisively clearing the 10-week moving average, a move above 14,000 for the Nasdaq and 35,000 for the Dow would give a psychological boost to Wall Street and bode well for further gains in AI stocks like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft.

Meta Riding Back Of Llama With Microsoft
----------------------------------------


Free for research and commercial use, Meta Platforms last month released [Code Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/), a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Built on top of [Llama 2](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/), Code Llama expands the long-standing relationship between Meta and Microsoft. Microsoft is the preferred partner for Llama 2.


Looking to spur continued innovations in artificial intelligence — particularly in generative AI — Meta believes Code Llama has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code.


Meta Platforms Turns Around, Tops Estimates
-------------------------------------------


On July 26, Meta Platforms — the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — [topped Wall Street estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-parent-beats-q2-goals/). It earned $2.98 a share on sales of $32 billion in Q2. Year over year, Meta earnings rose 21% while sales advanced 11%.


For the current quarter, analysts forecast 55% EPS growth, leading to a 41% gain for the year. By comparison, Google stock, which is categorized in the same internet content industry group as Meta, has Wall Street expectations of 36% EPS growth in Q3 and 24% earnings growth for the full year.


The internet content group ranks No. 40 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Microsoft's group — desktop software — ranks No. 19.


Nvida stock hails from the fabless semiconductor group, which ranks 74th, while Amazon's internet retail group earns a lowly 107 ranking.

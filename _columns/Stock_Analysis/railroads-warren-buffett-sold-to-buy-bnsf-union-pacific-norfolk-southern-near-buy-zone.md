 When **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) CEO Warren Buffett said he would buy BNSF Railway in 2009 in what was then the company's biggest purchase ever, he also decided to sell Berkshire's shares in rival railroads **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) and **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)).
While the BNSF purchase has performed well for the "Oracle of Omaha," Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific may be getting ready to pull into new buy zones.

After several quarters of negative growth, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific have both shown rebounding numbers.


Norfolk Southern has posted three quarters of improving profitability, with earnings growth coming in at 15% in Q1. Sales growth has shown a similar trajectory, with a 6% gain in the latest report.


Union Pacific has also delivered improving top and bottom line numbers over the last three quarters, with 14% EPS and 6% sales growth in Q1.


Both stocks have garnered interest among institutional investors, but here too Norfolk Southern has the edge, with an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio and seven quarters of rising fund ownership.

Norfolk Southern has been outpacing Union Pacific in terms of technical action as well.

Norfolk Southern closed Wednesday just 1% below a 125.10 buy point in a second-stage base. The stock has shown several up days in strong volume as it approaches the entry, pushing its RS line sharply higher. The stock closed fractionally higher Thursday at 124.50.


Union Pacific temporarily cleared a 111.48 buy point in late April, but quickly retreated. After finding support at its 50-day line, the stock has been rebounding. It ended Wednesday 1% below the buy zone. Union Pacific ended Thursday's session slightly higher at 110.59.

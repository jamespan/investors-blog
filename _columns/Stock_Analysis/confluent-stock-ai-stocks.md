Confluent Headlines Stellar Group
---------------------------------


Building on open-source platforms Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, the [Confluent Platform](https://investors.confluent.io/news-releases/news-release-details/new-confluent-platform-apache-flink-makes-it-easy-manage-and) provides what the company calls a fundamentally new category of data infrastructure. Confluent aims to "set data in motion" with its data streaming platform. The goal is to fix what it calls a "giant mess" in legacy data architecture. It focuses on doing that by providing a data streaming platform to continuously stream, connect, process and govern data at any scale, anywhere.


Partnerships with Azure from Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud from Alphabet are just a start. Working across a range of industries, Confluent has also integrated with Netflix, Walmart, **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) and many others.


Featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/confluent-stock-cflt-ai-enterprise-software/) earlier this month, Confluent joins **Commvault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) among the top stocks in the database software group. The industry ranks No. 54 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Although Confluent did not join ServiceNow, **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and other software-sector stocks on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/palantir-stock-cintas-lead-new-buys-by-best-mutual-funds/), the AI-fueled stock has shown signs of strong demand. It earns an B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and an impressive 2.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


Plus, 30 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD own shares of Confluent.


Confluent Stock Eyes Breakout Riding Big Growth
-----------------------------------------------


As partners Amazon and Google trade around record highs and Microsoft sets up, Confluent stock takes aim at a breakout of its own.


Shares have gotten a boost from a strong rebound in earnings growth. Gaining momentum during the June 2023 to March 2024 quarters, Confluent posted triple-digit earnings growth in the second and third quarters of this year. In Q3, the company posted a 400% year-over-year spike in earnings to 10 cents per share. Sales rose 25% to $250.2 million.


That growth, plus strong institutional demand, continue to pull Confluent stock out of a long slump that began in November of 2021.


The AI and database leader has formed what can be viewed as a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). The buy point is 34.08. Multiple positive factors bode well for the stock.


A huge gap up on Oct. 31 after Q3 earnings — and Confluent's continued rise since then — show demand for the stock.


While now clinging to support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) has just crossed back above the longer-term 200-day benchmark.


Plus, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) rose sharply as the current base formed, a sign of clear market leadership. But the RS line has slipped as Confluent pulled back this week for keep working on its [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-how-to-spot-a-good-one/).

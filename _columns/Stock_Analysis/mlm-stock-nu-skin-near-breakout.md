Multilevel marketing (MLM) company and **Herbalife Nutrition** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) rival **Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) has earned a spot on [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/). But is the network-marketing stock ready for its close-up as it tries to approach a new buy zone?




Along with fellow MLM stock **Usana Health Sciences** ([USNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USNA)), Nu Skin and Herbalife are members of the personal-care industry group. Usana ties **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)) for the No. 1 spot in the group with the highest possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). Nu Skin is right behind it with a 98. Herbalife has an 85 Composite Rating.


The group ranks No. 18 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.

Network Marketing Profits
-------------------------


Based in Provo, Utah, Nu Skin sells beauty and wellness products through its network marketing system. Also referred to as MLM, network marketing involves the selling of Nu Skin products through its global network of independent, commission-based "sales leaders."


Its MLM sales team is active in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Pacific.


In Q2, Nu Skin posted a 122% spike in earnings growth, up from a 55% gain in Q1. Over the last three quarters, its EPS growth has averaged 76%. Second-quarter sales growth rose 28% to $704 million.


Nu Skin sports a solid 26% return on equity but a more modest 12% annual pretax profit margin.


On Aug. 2, the network marketer announced an increase to its [stock buyback plan](http://ir.nuskin.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=103888&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2361876) to $500 million, an increase of approximately $408 million.


Although Nu Skin did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-apple-adobe-ross/), it has shown solid institutional demand. It sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.2 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 38 mutual funds with an A+ rating have reported a position in the stock.


MLM Stock To Watch
------------------


Nu Skin is working on an early stage flat base currently showing an 88.78 buy point.


Its relative strength is still below new-high ground, so look for that to improve by the time of any breakout attempt.


On Friday, Nu Skin rose 0.7%, putting it 5% below the entry.



Herbalife has slipped back below its 50-day line, and its prior buy point, while working on a flat base. It's edging higher Friday and trying to retake both benchmarks. It remains 1% below its 50-day line and 9% below its new 60.51 entry. Meanwhile, Usana has also fallen below its 50-day moving average, and lost another 2% on Friday.

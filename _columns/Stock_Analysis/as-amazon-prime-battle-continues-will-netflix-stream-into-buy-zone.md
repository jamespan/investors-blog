As **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) subscribers eagerly await the Oct. 27 debut of season two of its hit series "Stranger Things," investors are already tuning in to see if the stock can finish the right side of a new base and clear the 191.60 buy point in heavy volume.


Netflix Vs. Amazon Prime
------------------------


Long before fellow [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) decided to disrupt the grocery business with Amazon Go and its purchase of **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)), it took aim at Netflix, offering a similar streaming service and producing original content exclusive to Amazon Prime members.









 
 
 Both companies have aggressively expanded their streaming services internationally, and Netflix now has 104 million members in 190 countries.
While Amazon doesn't release the official head count, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that there are [85 million Amazon Prime members](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-prime-membership-up-35-as-big-shopping-day-coming/). The Amazon Prime streaming service is available in over 200 countries.


166% Growth In Q3?
------------------


After reporting 114% earnings growth in Q4 and a 567% gain in Q1, Netflix slowed to a still-solid 67% increase in Q2. The consensus analyst estimate calls for a 166% rise in the current quarter. Sales growth has ranged from 23% to 36% over the past eight reports.


Institutional demand is reflected in a 1.4 up/down volume ratio and four straight quarters of rising ownership by funds.


After clearing a 129.39 buy point in January, Netflix rose 48% before starting to form its current [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) in July. The pullback began after the stock gapped up on Q2 earnings and rose nearly 13% beyond a 166.97 entry.



While it's certainly not ideal to see a stock round-trip from a double-digit gain back to the initial buy point — as Netflix did — the stock found support around the prior entry and at its 50-day moving average.


Volume rose earlier in the week as Netflix has bounced off that benchmark line. In a sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day moving average has just moved back above the longer term 50-day line.


Netflix closed 5% higher for the week, leaving it 9% below the 191.60 entry. Look for the relative strength line to reach new high ground as the stock tries to complete the base.

New medical stock **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) "is at the center of a megatrend in health care," according to Leerink Partners. That megatrend is the shifting of health insurance costs from employers to employees in response to new ObamaCare regulations.

  

That could boost growth for HealthEquity, since it's a leading provider of consumer-directed health plans, more commonly known as health savings accounts, or HSAs.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After going public last July, HealthEquity reported fiscal Q2 EPS growth of 50%, followed by a 25% increase in Q3. Revenue growth has been even more impressive, ranging from 30% to 43% over the past seven quarters. The company is scheduled to report Q4 numbers on March 24.

  

HealthEquity's 4% return on equity is relatively weak, and its 84 Composite Rating is below the 90 or higher score you'd prefer to see. But there have been signs of strong institutional demand, including an A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and rising fund ownership.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

HealthEquity broke out of a base in November and rose as high as 27.74 before pulling back. It's now working on a new base.

  

The stock recently regained its 10-week line, and has been closing near the top of its daily price ranges, a sign that investors are picking up shares. That's further confirmed by three heavy-volume up weeks in the right side of the base. Also note how the relative strength line is trending higher. See if it can move into or near new high-ground ahead of any breakout.

  

The buy point is 27.84, 10 cents above the peak on the left. If the stock forms a handle, the entry would be 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

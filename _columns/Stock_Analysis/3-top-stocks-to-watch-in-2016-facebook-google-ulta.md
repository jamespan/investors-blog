Despite the rocky market of 2015, leaders like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) have managed to move higher and continue to show resilience as we head into the New Year.

  

**The Warren Buffett Model**

  

After trending lower to close out 2014 and treading water for the first half of this year, the tech giant changed its name to Alphabet in August, establishing Google as a division overseeing search, Android and YouTube.

  

Executive chairman Eric Schmidt said one reason for the name change was to emulate another successful conglomerate: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

  

On July 16, just weeks before the announcement, Google reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings, sending the stock 25% higher for the week in volume 178% above average.

  

Alphabet was featured in the IBD Stock Analysis on Sept. 10 as it was working on a new base and again on Oct. 20, three days before it cleared the 713.43 buy point on another strong earnings report.

  

Despite selling pressure in the market, Alphabet has shown resilience, with its Relative Strength line trending into new high ground. That could bode well for 2016.

  

**Moving Facebook Higher**

  

The Dec. 15 IBD Stock Analysis noted [5 reasons Facebook is a top stock to watch in 2016](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/121515-785347-facebook-google-mobile-ads-messenger-moments-oculus-instagram.aspx) , including rising mobile ad revenue, industry-leading profit margins and the yet-to-be-monetized potential of its Messenger app, which has over 700 million active monthly users.

  

Facebook was previously featured in the IBD Stock Analysis on March 20, July 10 and Sept. 15. The choppy action reflects the volatility and hesitation seen in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 throughout 2015.

  

But like fellow Internet icon Alphabet, the social media giant has shown strength and could be poised to move higher if the New Year rings in a better market.

  

**Will Ulta Look Pretty In 2016?**

  

From January through August, the chart for the cosmetics and beauty supplies retailer showed mild nips and tucks, rather than the extreme makeovers seen in other stocks.

  

Ulta made its 2015 debut in the IBD Stock Analysis on Jan. 16, just before breaking out of this flat base. The Illinois-based firm retailer was highlighted again on Apr. 30 as it continued to trade in a very tight range.

  

While the stock did fall sharply during the Aug. 24 flash crash, it quickly rebounded and was still trading in a narrow range when it was featured again on Oct. 22.

  

Ultra tried but failed to clear a 176.87 buy point, until reporting earnings on Dec. 3. After rising nearly 8% for the week in heavy volume, the stock has managed to hold those gains despite weakness in the general market.

  

With its Relative Strength line also trending higher, Ulta Beauty earns a spot, along with Facebook and Alphabet, on a list of top stocks to watch in 2016.

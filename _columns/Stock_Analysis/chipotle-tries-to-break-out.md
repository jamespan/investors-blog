Founded in 1993, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) pioneered the fast-casual concept and now operates more than 1,500 restaurants.

  

In 2011, it launched ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, featuring noodles and rice dishes in the culinary styles of Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. The seventh ShopHouse opened in May.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth has come in above 25% (the minimum found in most winning stocks) only twice over the past eight quarters, and EPS gains slowed from 30% in Q4 to 12% in Q1.

  

But sales growth has been on the rise, moving up from 18% to 24% in recent reports. Chipotle is reporting Q2 numbers July 21.

  

Analysts expect annual earnings to rise 21% this year and 27% in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Chipotle's 97 Composite Rating is tops among the 56 companies in its Retail-Restaurants industry group.

  

The stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.8 up/down volume ratio indicate institutional demand, which is further confirmed by the rising number of funds that own Chipotle shares.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a big run from January 2010 through April 2012, the stock pulled back to form a deep, 63-week cup-with-handle base. It broke out in July 2013 and ran up more than 60% in less than nine months.

  

Chipotle is now working on a first-stage cup-with-handle that has lacked strong accumulation in the right side of the pattern.

  

On Tuesday, the stock poked above a 602.31 buy point on light volume. It fell below that level the next day but retook the buy point in the last hour of Thursday's short session. Look for heavy trading as Chipotle pushes higher.

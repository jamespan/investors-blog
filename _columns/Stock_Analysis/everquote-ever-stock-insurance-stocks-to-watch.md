The insurance sector seems to have gotten lost while trade tariffs, artificial intelligence and other investing themes swarm Wall Street. Still, insurance has posted [the fourth-highest gains so far this year](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-mar-04-2025/) out of the 33 sectors followed by Investor's Business Daily, with a 7% climb. And **EverQuote** ([EVER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVER)) has become one of the stocks to watch in that group.


An online insurance marketplace, EverQuote owns the best [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) out of 16 companies in the diversified insurance industry group. It became profitable last year and posted explosive sales growth of 72%, 163% and 165% during the past three quarters.




The company operates a website where consumers can shop for insurance coverage. Most of the business is auto coverage, which accounted for 89% of total revenue last year. EverQuote's services are free, but it earns revenue from referrals to insurance providers.


While other insurance stocks face the risk of covering massive losses, EverQuote merely acts as a shopping hub for the industry. Yet, the industry's health does impact EverQuote.


EverQuote Stock: Industry Improvement Helps
-------------------------------------------


Auto insurers are emerging from a slump. A rise in claims, inflation and inadequate premiums plagued carriers from 2021 to 2023. That contributed to revenue declines of as much as 47% from 2023 through the first half of last year for EverQuote.


The company's turnaround began in the second quarter of 2024, when it returned to sales growth and earned 17 cents a share vs. a year-ago loss of 40 cents.


At an industry conference Tuesday, EverQuote executives said because insurance has become more expensive, more people are shopping for lower rates. In fact, the company is experiencing historically high shopping levels over last year.


EverQuote got a break on the regulatory front in January, when a federal court struck down a requirement that would have limited the number of insurers that could contact an individual shopper.


Stocks To Watch: Insurance Stock Near Buy Point
-----------------------------------------------



The insurance stock hasn't made a new high since Aug. 6, spending the time since then forming a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). The buy point is 28.09, although a [handle may develop](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) and provide a lower entry. The stock declined more than 40% during its base formation, undercutting a previous cup base. This [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-tell-if-a-growth-stocks-run-is-getting-too-old/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/), an indicator found in IBD Charts and [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge), is near new highs.


The last week of February was quite bullish for the insurance stock. Shares shot up nearly 30% in the highest weekly since the company's initial public offering in June 2018. Most of the move came on Feb. 25, when EverQuote reported outstanding fourth-quarter results.


Earnings of 33 cents a share compared favorably to a year-earlier loss of 19 cents a share. It was the fourth straight profitable quarter for EverQuote, according to FactSet. Results easily beat Wall Street expectations, solidifying its status as a stock to watch.


Analysts expect current-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share, an increase of 180%, with sales of $157.9 million, up 73% year over year.

Vantiv provides payment processing services to retailers, merchants and financial institutions across the U.S. Founded more than 40 years ago, it [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in March 2012.

  

Ohio-based **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)) recently launched Vantiv Mobile Accept, a card reader that attaches to mobile devices to let retailers take payments anytime, anywhere. Mobile Accept is compatible with **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) Apple Pay.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Vantiv's sales growth has accelerated the past two quarters, coming in at 17% and 31%. And after four quarters of negative growth, earnings growth has also bounced back, with a 23% rise in Q3.

  

Vantiv sports a stellar 40% return on equity but carries a high debt-to-equity ratio of 225%. Overall, it earns a 98 IBD Composite Rating, which means that it has outperformed 98% of all other stocks, and its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio indicate institutional demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a nice start from its March 2012 IPO, Vantiv struggled to clear resistance around the $24 mark until May 2013.

  

This year, Vantiv's new area of resistance has been just under $35. It's now approaching that price point again as it works on a new consolidation as part of a first-stage base-on-base.

  

The stock fell 5% on heavy volume after reporting Q3 numbers on Oct. 30. But that drop was followed by several heavy-volume up days as Vantiv regained its 50-day line.

  

Vantiv has generally been closing near the top of its price range and has found support at its 10-day line in the right side of the base. That action points to institutional support.

  

As of the close Friday, Vantiv was trading just under its 35 buy point.

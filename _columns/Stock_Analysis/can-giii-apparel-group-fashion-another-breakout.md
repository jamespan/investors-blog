Today we'll look at G-III Apparel Group ([GIII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIII)), which designs and manufactures apparel and goods for men and women, including outerwear, dress-wear, performance clothing, footwear, luggage and accessories. 

  

They market their products under proprietary brands, licensed brands and private retail labels. G-III's goods are sold through over 400 company-operated stores, as well as through department stores, specialty retailers, and mass merchant stores within the US, Canada and Europe. 

  

**Key Fundamentals** 

  

Earnings growth has fluctuated from quarter to quarter, slipping from 55% to 20% in the latest report. Sales growth has been more consistent, rising steadily higher over the last four quarters. 

  

The company is scheduled to report its latest numbers on September 2. 

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 10%, followed by a 19% rise in 2015. 

  

G-III sports a 16% return on equity, just shy of the 17% minimum you prefer to see. But it earns an A for its SMR Rating which tracks sales, margin and return on equity as a whole. 

  

G-III's 99 Composite Rating ranks No. 1 among the 25 stocks in the Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group. 

  

The B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks, and the Up/Down Volume Ratio is a solid 1.5. Anything over 1 indicates demand. 

  

The number of funds that own the stock has been rising in recent reports. And one typically better-performing fund has reported a position in the stock: Alger Small Cap Growth B (ALSCX ). 

  

**Chart Analysis** 

  

G-III broke out of a cup-shaped base back in Aug. of last year. But that was immediately followed by four back-to-back down weeks, as the stock fell below its 10-week moving average and undercut the low in the cup. That resets the base count. 

  

G-III was able to retake its 10-week line in Sep. after posting better than expected earnings. That line became a consistent level of support, and bolted off that moving average in Dec. on another strong earnings report. 

  

However G-III was unable to maintain that momentum and ended up forming a double bottom. It broke out, but failed to climb more than 20% before pulling back to form a new flat base. The stock did manage to break out, but once again quickly pulled back to form a new consolidation. It's a flat base, which is part of a first-stage, base-on-base. 

  

Note how the bottom of the current formation is just above the line of resistance in the prior base. It's a positive sign to see a former ceiling of resistance become a floor of support like that. 

  

The ideal buy point is 84.38, 10 cents above the peak on the left. With earnings scheduled to be released on Sep. 2, see if the stock can climb above its ideal buy point on volume at least 40% - 50% above average. 

  

But also keep an eye on the overall market, to see if it shifts from its current correction back into an uptrend.

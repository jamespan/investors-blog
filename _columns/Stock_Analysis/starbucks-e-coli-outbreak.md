Â 


Like **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) was recently hit with an E. coli scare.


While the coffee giant had to pull its "holiday turkey with stuffing paninis" from West Coast stores as a result, its stock remained relatively unfazed by the outbreak.


But selling pressure in the general market now has Starbucks testing support at its 10-week moving average as it works on a [new base](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736314&sourceid=735787).


The java giant has found pioneering success with its Mobile Order & Pay app that lets **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Android smartphone users skip the lines by preordering their drinks.

Customers can already refill their pre-paid cards using Apple Pay, but the new rollout will let them use it for all purchases.


**Key Numbers**


Starbucks has delivered three consecutive quarters of 18% revenue growth, while earnings gains have ranged from 16% to 24% during the same period.


For its fiscal 2015 fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Starbucks met EPS expectations and beat on revenue and same-store-sales growth.


The restaurants industry group ranked a lowly No. 135 in Friday's IBD, but Starbucks' 92 Composite Rating earns the top slot among its peers, ahead of **Ruth's Hospitality** ([RUTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUTH)) and **Chuy's Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)).


**Chart Analysis**


Starbucks broke out of a [flat base](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=3) in January, rising as much as 40% before starting to form another consolidation in August.


It's now working on a new flat base with a 64.10 entry.


Starbucks slipped below the 10-week moving average during the week, but is trying to climb back above it.

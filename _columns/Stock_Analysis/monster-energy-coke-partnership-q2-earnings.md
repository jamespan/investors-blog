After already making a monster run over the last year, **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) took a breather recently and is now trying to break out and launch another big move.

  

The maker of high-octane energy drinks is hoping to get a further boost from its partnership with **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and rising market share for the energy drink industry.

  

Under its agreement with Coke, which was announced in August and just closed last month, the soda giant transfers its energy drink division to Monster, including the Burn, NOS, Full Throttle and other brands.

  

In return, Monster transfers its non-energy drinks to Coke. Big Red also now has a 17% stake in Monster.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth fell from 64% to 13% in Q1. Analysts attributed the slowdown to short-term adjustments Monster had to make as a result of the partnership with Coke, such as canceling deals with other distributors.

  

But revenue edged higher for the second straight quarter.

  

Monster is expected to announce Q2 earnings Aug. 4.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 19% this year, followed by a 23% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

The Corona, Calif.-based company has a strong 39% return on equity and a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

The A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to heavy institutional buying over the last 13 weeks.

  

But the 0.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio is less impressive. See if volume on up days picks up and the ratio improves to a 1.0 or higher.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Last year, Monster soared on news of the Coca-Cola deal, closing over 34% higher for the week ended Aug. 15.

  

From there, the stock consistently found support at the 10-week line as it climbed higher for several months.

  

Monster jumped again on Q4 earnings in February, then pulled back to form a third-stage base.

  

Such later-stage patterns are more prone to failure than early-stage patterns, and that proved true again with Monster.

  

The stock tried to break out in April, but quickly retreated, then dropped sharply below the 10-week line when it reported a slowdown in Q1 earnings in May.

  

On the positive side, the stock undercut the low in the prior pattern, which [resets the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) and makes the current consolidation a first-stage cup-with-handle.

  

Monster cleared the 139.75 buy point on Tuesday, but volume was lacking. It came in just 5% above average, well below the 40% plus spike you'd prefer to see.

  

Volume was even lighter on Wednesday, as the stock flirted with the buy point again and closed just barely above it.

  

See if the stock can move more decisively higher in heavy trading, and keep an eye out for Q2 earnings on Aug. 4.

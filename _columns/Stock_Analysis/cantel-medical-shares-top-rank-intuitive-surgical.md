Although perhaps not as well-known as [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) member **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), maker of the da Vinci Surgical System, **Cantel Medical** ([CMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMD)) shares the No. 1-ranking with the robot-assisted surgery pioneer within the Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group.









 
 
 Cantel Medial provides infection-prevention products and services, specializing in endoscopy, water purification and filtration and health care disposables.
The New Jersey-based company has followed an aggressive acquisition strategy to drive growth, making at least 30 purchases since 2000, including its 2001 buyout of endoscopy and dialysis products maker Minntech, now known as Medivators.


In August, [Cantel completed its acquisition of BHT Group](https://investor.shareholder.com/CNTL/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1038003), the leading German manufacturer of automated endoscope reprocessors and instrument washer disinfectors. In April, it [purchased endoscopy business assets from Australia's CR Kennedy & Company](https://investor.shareholder.com/CNTL/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1019755).


Both Cantel Medical and Intuitive Surgical sport a 97 Composite Raxmting, meaning they're outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking fundamental and technical criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). The medical equipment industry group ranks No. 47 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


New Breakout
------------


While Intuitive Surgical has already broken out and is now extended, when this story was originally published on Nov. 13, Cantel was trading below a 99.93 entry in a [flat base](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/), which is part of a first-stage base-on-base formation. The next day, Cantel Medical broke out and is now still trading within the buy zone, which extends to 104.92 buy zone. It closed Monday's session at 102.93.


The relative strength line entered new high ground at the time of the breakout, a bullish sign of market leadership. An A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 up/down volume ratio and one quarter of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for shares.


On Monday, Intuitive Surgical closed essentially flat at 393.03, not far below the all-time high of 400 it on Friday.



Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund ([BCSIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCSIX)), which was the [best-performing small-cap growth fund](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/small-cap-stocks-that-help-make-this-brown-capital-fund-top-notch/) with $100 million or more in assets over the last decade, has a substantial stake in Cantel Medical, which has a market cap of $4.1 billion.


Earnings On Tap
---------------


On Sept. 28, Cantel Medical reported a slowdown from 16% to 13% for fiscal 2017 Q4 earnings. But that topped estimates, and revenue growth increased from 11% to 15%.


The company is expected to report fiscal 2018 first-quarter numbers in early December. Analysts expect EPS growth of 5%. For the full fiscal year, consensus estimates call for a 12% rise in earnings, followed by an 18% gain in fiscal 2019.


Cantel sports a 17% pretax profit margin and 18% return on equity.

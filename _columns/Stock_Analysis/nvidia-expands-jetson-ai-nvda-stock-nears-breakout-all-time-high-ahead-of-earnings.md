In 1962, an animated show about a futuristic family, The Jetsons, took to the airwaves. Now, 58 years later, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has announced the expansion of its [Jetson AI at the Edge](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-jetson-nano-2gb-the-ultimate-ai-and-robotics-starter-kit-for-students-educators-robotics-hobbyists) platform. At the same time, Nvidia stock is trying to rocket higher and launch a new breakout.




The Jetson AI platform is an entry-level developer kit priced at just $59. With it, Nvidia wants to bring the potential of [AI technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) and robotics to a new generation of students, educators and hobbyists.


Meanwhile, ranging from entry-level artificial intelligence devices to advanced platforms for fully autonomous machines, the Edge AI platform is not simply for amateurs and enthusiasts. Among other applications, Edge AI transforms standard servers into [cloud-based](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), secure, AI data centers.


According to founder and CEO Jensen Huang, companies can use the Nvidia EGX Edge AI platform "to build AI services ranging from smart retail to robotic factories to automated call centers."

AI Technology Drives 105% Growth
--------------------------------


After slumping in 2019, Nvidia has rebounded with newfound strength. Over the past three quarters, the Silicon Valley-based company has generated average EPS growth of 105%. It's scheduled to report fiscal 2021 Q3 results on Nov. 18, with analysts looking for 44% earnings growth.


Nvidia sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, annual pretax profit margins and return on equity as a whole. Indicating efficiency, Nvidia has low debt and a 35% pretax profit margin and 33% ROE.


Nvidia stock joins fellow cloud and AI technology stocks **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/stocks-to-watch-best-mutual-funds-buy-amazon-zoom-video-alibaba-apple-stock/).


Nvidia ties AMD with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) in the fabless [semiconductor](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) designers industry group, which means they are outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). The industry ranks No. 34 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Will Nvidia Rocket To New All-Time High?
----------------------------------------


Also, with earnings a month off, Nvidia is targeting a 589.17 buy point in a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The stock is currently trading 6% below that entry price.


However, aside from a sharp but short-lived retreat during the coronavirus crash in February and March, Nvidia stock has been on a tear since hitting a bottom in June 2019. Along the way, the stock has found consistent support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). Throughout that run, Nvidia's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has been trending solidly higher — a sign of  stock market leadership.


On Thursday, as leading tech stocks like AMD, Amazon and Microsoft pulled back in a market sell-off, Nvidia stock also was down. But volume was light and Nvidia managed to come off its lows and close at the top of its range for the day. On Friday, Nvidia slipped a little over 1%, but in light volume.


Like The Jetsons flying around Orbit City, see if Nvidia can continue to ride the uptrend in tech stocks and break out to new heights.

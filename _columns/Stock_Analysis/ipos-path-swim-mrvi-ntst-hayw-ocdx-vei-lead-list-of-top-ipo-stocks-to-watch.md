With the stock market under pressure, now is a time to tread carefully before buying growth stocks. But it is always a good time to refresh your list of stocks to watch and [run stock screens](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/) to identify and research the best IPO stocks.




Checking [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) is a good starting point. You'll find [promising IPOs](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)), **Netstreit** ([NTST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTST)), **Vine Energy** ([VEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEI)) and **Ortho Clinical Diagnostics** ([OCDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCDX)). Moving up for a third straight session, MRVI stock is the [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/coronavirus-stock-why-covid-vaccines-are-not-end-game-for-maravai/).


Tying in to the boom in at-home leisure that has boosted [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)), new IPO stocks **Hayward** ([HAYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAYW)) and **Latham** ([SWIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWIM)) also join IPO Leaders.


Robotic process automation software stock **UiPath** ([PATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATH)) just fell off the list. As IPOs often do, [UiPath](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-software-leader-uipath-approaches-first-buy-point/) has encountered selling pressure as the very young IPO builds its first base. Whill still under pressure, PATH stock jumped over 6% Friday.

IPOs To Watch As Growth Stocks Feel The Heat
--------------------------------------------


The IPO Leaders list is a computer-generated stock screen that zeros in on newer issues showing the "N" in the [CAN SLIM Investing System](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) and other telltale traits often seen in the best growth stocks.


[N stands for new](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/) — a newer company, a new trend in the company or industry, or a new price high.


Here's a quick look at six IPOs to have on your radar.


HAYW Stock Makes Splash Among Top IPOs
--------------------------------------


Hayward, which makes swimming pool equipment mainly for the residential market, swam right past an 18.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at the end of April and is now extended. In a sign of strong demand, HAYW stock celebrated Cinco de Mayo by gapping up more than 24% on May 5. The sharp upward trajectory of its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) reflects how it is outperforming the S&P 500.


The big move came on its first earnings report as a public company. Hayward made a splash with earnings that came in 420% above a year-ago loss. Sales growth came in at 96%. For the full year, analysts expect the New Jersey-based company to post 474% EPS growth.


Hayward closed over 7% higher Friday in rising volume.


SWIM Stock Rides New Wave Of IPOs
---------------------------------


Latham is the largest designer, manufacturer and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Based in Latham, N.Y., the company went public less than a month ago, on April 23. As of the end of 2020, Latham has over 2,000 full-time employees.


Latham has yet to release its first earnings report as a public company, but its rising RS line is already showing stock market leadership. Being such a new IPO, SWIM stock has not established a [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) or an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) but does sport a strong 3.0 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/).


Like HAYW stock, SWIM stock rode the stock market rebound Friday, diving in to more than a 7% gain.


IPO Stocks Near Buy Points
--------------------------


While it remains a challenging stock market, Maravai and Vine Energy are among the leading IPOs forming [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) and moving into potential buy zones.


Maravai LifeSciences provides critical products to enable the development of drug therapies, diagnostics and novel vaccines, and to support research on human diseases. It works with many of the world's leading [biopharmaceutical](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), vaccine, diagnostics, and cell and gene therapy companies.


MRVI stock is working on a consolidation with a 40.34 buy point. After slipping below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), the November 2020 IPO has retaken that benchmark line. Maravai rose more than 3% Friday.


Based in Plano, Texas, Vine Energy was established in 2021 following the combination of privately held predecessor companies Vine Oil & Gas, Brix Oil & Gas Holdings and Harvest Royalties. Vine Energy is the now the leading, pure-play Haynesville Basin [natural gas company](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/). Vine Energy holds an average operated working interest of 83% in 227,000 net effective acres in the core of the Haynesville Basin of Texas and Louisiana.


With its first earnings report as a public company set for Monday, VEI stock is trying to pump up a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 14.21 entry. Its RS line has slumped as the chart pattern has formed. Vine Energy sprouted nearly 4% Friday.


More IPOs To Watch
------------------


Netstreit and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics also join this list of top IPO stocks to keep an eye on.


Based in Dallas, Netstreit is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in retail properties nationwide. The company pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.8% on an annualized basis.


NTST stock broke out in early April and has continued to show resilience with tight trading. Netstreit is now slightly extended.


Ortho Clinical Diagnostics is one of the world's largest pure-play in-vitro diagnostics companies. The company supports over 1 million of these tests every day, impacting over 800,000 patients.


In March, OCDX stock cleared an IPO base and has continued higher, with its rising RS line reflecting that move. Last quarter, the company posted a whopping 2,300% spike in earnings, but analysts' prognosis for next quarter is a 67% decline. For the full year, analysts expect 2% EPS growth.

Chinese e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) has risen sharply in recent months, and now fellow [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) stock **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) may be ready to launch a new move of its own.









 
 
 While the mortgage insurance provider is in a completely different industry than Alibaba, the two highly rated companies share several key traits when it comes to the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).
Both companies have exceptional annual pretax profit margins: Essent (68%) and Alibaba (49%). And the return on equity for both Essent (18%) and Alibaba (24%) exceeds the 17% minimum typically seen in top-performing stocks.


Strong profit margins and ROE have helped Essent generate a three-year EPS growth rate of 51%, as well as 42% average earnings growth over the past three quarters. For Alibaba, the numbers are 21% and 35%, respectively.


Both Alibaba and Essent are also leading stocks within highly ranked industry groups. Alibaba is the No. 1-rated stock within the No. 10-ranked internet retail industry group, while Essent holds the No. 1 slot within the No. 14-ranked mortgage and related services group.


In addition to earning a spot on the Sector Leaders screen, both stocks are also featured on the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Both lists have been [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


New Breakout Ahead?
-------------------


While Alibaba has climbed well beyond the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) it cleared earlier in the year, Essent is within striking distance of a new breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/).


The stock has been finding support at its 10-week line and at prior buy points while forming this steppingstone formation.



Essent is also showing two other signs of technical strength. Its relative strength line is near new high ground ahead of a possible breakout, and its 10-day moving average just moved back above the longer-term 50-day line.


On Friday, the stock rose over 2% in heavy volume, bringing it within 1% of the 39.60 buy point at 39.19. On Monday, the stock barely and briefly cleared the entry, but reversed in heavy volume to close below the buy zone and down over 1%.


If the stock continues to pullback, look for volume to lighten up, then see if Essent can rebound to retake the buy point in heavy trade.

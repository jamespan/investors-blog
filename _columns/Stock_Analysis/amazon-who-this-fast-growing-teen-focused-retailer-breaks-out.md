Like fellow discount retailer **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), teen-focused **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) has so far stood firm and continued to grow despite the aggressive expansion of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).









 
 
 In fact, while Amazon's Composite Rating is a middling 54, Five Below and Ollie's Bargain Outlet both sport the highest-possible 99, meaning they are [outperforming 99% of all stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).
Recent chart action reflects those grades. Amazon is struggling to get back above its 50-day line and complete its new pattern, while Five Below and Ollie's have both now cleared new buy points and remain within buy range.


Accelerating Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------------


Five Below has posted two quarters of rising EPS growth, including a spike from 25% to 67% for the quarter ended July 29. Revenue gains have increased for three straight quarters, climbing from 18% to 29% during that time.


Ollie's Bargain Outlet has posted two quarters of rising top- and bottom-line growth. Amazon saw revenue rise 25%, up from 23% in Q1, but earnings growth fell from a gain of 38% to a decline of 78%.


Five Below and Ollie's share top billing within the discount retailers group, followed by **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).


Where's The Volume?
-------------------


Although Five Below has now entered a 54.23-56.94 buy zone, volume is a concern. Trade on Wednesday's breakout was below average, and there have been more heavy-volume down weeks than up weeks in the base.


Also note that the stock's C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates a roughly equal amount of buying and selling by large investors over the last 13 weeks.



But weekly volume is rising, and signs of institutional demand for Five Below include a 1.3 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


The relative strength line has been moving closer to high ground, a positive sign of market leadership.


Five Below closed up nearly 9% for the week and about 1% above the buy point.

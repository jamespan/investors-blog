With Q2 earnings due Monday, will Texas Roadhouse continue to serve up a tasty breakout â€” or get grilled like its hand-cut steaks? The [IBD Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/062515-758959-texas-roadhouse-stock-near-buy-point.aspx) on June 25 featured the Southern-style steakhouse chain as it was working on a base. Since then, fellow restaurant stocks **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) have [moved higher after releasing earnings](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/073015-764294-chipotle-on-track-for-double-digit-profit-growth.htm). 

  

**Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) stock also has been on the rise as it gets ready to report.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Texas Roadhouse's sales and earnings accelerated in Q1, with revenue climbing to 16% and EPS gains jumping from 8% to 24%. Analysts expect earnings to rise 17% both this year and next.

  

The company has a 1.7% annualized dividend yield and has a 15% return on equity.

  

It earns a solid 94 Composite Rating, and its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Texas Roadhouse has shown tight, healthy trading in the right side of its current base, which has a 38.52 buy point.

  

After first testing that entry in mid-July, the stock slipped back below it. That type of stalled breakout has been a common occurrence recently, especially when the breakout attempt has come on weak volume, as it did for Texas Roadhouse.

  

But the stock did not decline enough to trigger the 7%-8% sell rule, and it found support at the 50-day moving average line.

  

It broke out again on Wednesday, this time on volume 51% above average.

  

The buying range is up to 5% above the ideal buy point, from 38.52 to 40.45.

  

As of Friday's close, Texas Roadhouse was still within that range. But keep in mind that it's risky to buy a stock just before it reports.

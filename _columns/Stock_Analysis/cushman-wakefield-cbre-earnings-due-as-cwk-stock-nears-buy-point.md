[Tracing its roots back to 1784](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/united-states/about-us/history), global real estate services firm **Cushman & Wakefield** ([CWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWK)) looks to construct a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) with its [relative strength hitting](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) a new high. Joining industry group peer **CBRE Group** ([CBRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBRE)), CWK stock made this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-scoop-up-apple-nvidia-microsoft-as-new-market-uptrend-begins/).




Fast forward to today. Cushman & Wakefield makes a recent list of [today's fastest-growing stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/fastest-growing-stocks-to-watch-2021/).


Following a corporate lineage that dates back to the time of George Washington and King George, Cushman & Wakefield was established in 1917. In the 1920s, the company opened an office in the **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) building, and eventually sold the land for a United Nations project. Adding to its illustrious history, Cushman & Wakefield served as project developer for the Sears Tower in Chicago in 1969.


After celebrating its 100 year anniversary in 2017, Cushman & Wakefield had an [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) in 2018. CWK stock is now just shy of an all-time high.

Cushman & Wakefield Earnings Due
--------------------------------


With headquarters in Chicago, Cushman & Wakefield has approximately 50,000 employees with 400 offices operating in 60 countries. The real estate firm handles leasing and brokerage services for companies in a wide range of industries. Among them are retail, e-commerce & logistics, data centers, automotive, energy, and emerging technology.


In 2020, the company generated $7.8 billion in revenue.


In Q3, the company posted a third straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth. EPS growth over the last three quarters has averaged 210%. When the company reports on Feb. 24, analysts expect Cushman & Wakefield to deliver 47% EPS growth for Q4 and a 111% increase for the full year.


CBRE Group reports the same day.


CWK Stock Nears Buy Point
-------------------------


With its relative strength line already at a new high, CWK stock is 2% shy of a 22.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Fellow real estate industry leader CBRE's RS line is also at a new high as it closes in on a new buy point. CBRE undercut the low in its prior consolidation to [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


Since retaking its 10-week moving average in October 2020, CWK stock has generally ascended right along that line. Cushman & Wakefield tested and found support again at that benchmark at the end of last month while forming its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


Keeping in mind that it's risky to buy stocks just before they release earnings, look for Cushman & Wakefield and CBRE to report well and break out in heavy volume.

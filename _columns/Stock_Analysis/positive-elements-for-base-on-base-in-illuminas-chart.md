Genetic analysis equipment maker **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) is bouncing off support at its 10-week moving average as it continues to form a base.

  

The stock shaped a cup-with-handle base from February through April 1, breaking out of a 71.16 buy point on April 27.

  

After making some gains, the stock fell back to its 50-day moving average as the general market weakened. Illumina found support at that benchmark line, and has generally held above the buy point from the April breakout.

  

It's been more than five weeks since the stock peaked, so the pullback should be considered a new base.

  

Because of the modest gains from the previous base, the new pattern and the prior one combine for a base-on-base formation.

  

The potential buy point is 76.91, unless Illumina forms a handle 2.

  

Several elements of the pattern are encouraging, including the tight price action and accumulation in the weeks of March 25, April 1 and April 29 3.

  

The Relative Strength line is near a new high 4, while the up/down volume ratio is at a quite bullish level 5.

While using Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home technology to help prevent break-ins to homes and small businesses, 2015 IPO **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) is trying to unlock another breakout for its stock.









 
 
 The Virginia-based company has a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), earning the No. 1 rank within the Computer-Software Security industry group, ahead of cybersecurity stocks **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), and **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)).
Like Alarm.com, Symantec and Qualys are also forming bases, while Check Point gapped down sharply below its 10-week moving averages on Q2 earnings.


Fast-Growing Smart Home Leader
------------------------------


Alarm.com is a leader in the rapidly growing smart home technology industry, providing solutions that help people monitor, protect and automate their homes.


The company also offers professional-grade security and energy management solutions to small and midsize businesses.


Boosted by a 17% annual pretax profit margin and 17% return on equity, Alarm.com has a strong three-year annual growth rate for both earnings (79%) and sales (26%).


Both top and bottom line growth rose in Q1, with earnings gains jumping from 36% to 76% and revenue rising from 23% to 26%.


Alarm.com is scheduled to report Q2 earnings after the market close on Aug. 8.


Strong Institutional Demand
---------------------------


Demand for shares in Alarm.com is reflected in a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio, but those may get lowered based on Wednesday's action.


The stock has also posted eight quarters of rising fund ownership, and note that 49 A- or higher rated funds have a position in the stock, including 23 with an A+ rating.


Breakout Attempt Ahead Of Earnings
----------------------------------


After a rocky start from its June 2015 initial public offering, Alarm.com has been on the rise and hit a new all-time high on Tuesday.


But on Wednesday, the stock pulled back below the 38.63 entry in a five-week long flat base and under its 10-day line in volume well above average.


It's not uncommon for a stock to break out, then pull back to or just below the buy point. As long as the stock does not fall more than 7% below the buy point, it remains a valid entry.


But look for heavy volume as the stock retakes the buy point to show conviction for the move, and keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just before an earnings report.

Several future market leaders had their IPOs in 2014, including **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). Health savings account administrator **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) was also in the class of 2014 and may now be setting up a new breakout.









 
 
 Each of these stocks has also been featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-analysis/), which is focused on highlighting top-rated [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). While there is no guarantee these stocks will breakout and head higher, it's a good fishing ground for your watch list.
HealthEquity was featured [Aug. 26, 2016 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/health-equity-nears-buy-point-as-big-banks-sell-hsa-assets/) while forming a flat base with a 31.79 entry. It broke out the next week and although it hasn't been a smooth climb, the stock has risen over 60% since then.


[Weibo](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/two-factors-driving-explosive-growth-for-the-twitter-of-china/), [Arista Networks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/no-1-ranked-cloud-networking-stock-floating-near-buy-zone/), and fellow 2014 IPOÂ [**HubSpot**](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/will-ai-chatbots-program-new-breakout-for-top-tech-ipo-hubspot/) ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) were all featured in the IBD Stock Analysis just before breaking out and launching nice gains.


[Grubhub](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/fastest-growing-internet-stock-grubhub-may-deliver-tasty-breakout/) has also made a nice gain since being featured in February, but it had to pull back and form the right side of a double bottom before it gained traction and headed higher.


It was a much longer journey for [Alibaba](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/is-chinese-ecommerce-giant-alibaba-setting-up-for-new-run/), which was featured on Dec. 18, 2014, when it looked like it might form a new base and head higher. But like many [big buzz IPOs that get off to a rough start](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/), Alibaba failed to complete the base and headed lower into a multiyear slump before taking off earlier this year.


Fellow Chinese internet stock [Momo](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/chinese-stock-with-788-growth-nears-buy-zone-earnings-due/) also ran into trouble after being featured on Aug. 10. While the stock did clear the buy point, it flashed a [clear sell signal](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) by falling more than 7% below that entry. Investors who followed that rule avoided the even bigger drop that followed.


Healthy Fundamentals
--------------------


HealthEquity has posted two quarters of rising earnings growth, beating analyst estimates for fiscal 2018 Q2 (ended July 31) by 40% when it generated a 31% rise in EPS.


The Utah-based company has been increasing earnings growth at an annual clip of 90% over the last three years, and sales have been rising at a 41% during the same time. The company is expected to report fiscal Q3 numbers in early December.


HealthEquity sports a solid 25% pretax profit margin and a 94 Composite Rating, earning it the No. 3 spot in the Commercial Services-Outsourcing group, just behind **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) and **Insperity** ([NSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSP)).


Third's The Charm?
------------------


After two failed breakouts since January, HealthEquity is hoping its new base will launch a successful climb. The current pattern is an early-stage cup without handle showing a 55.05 buy point.


The stock ended the week up over 2% and 6% below the entry.



A B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 up/down volume ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for the stock.


The relative strength line is trending upward and nearing new high ground, a bullish sign ahead of a potential breakout.


Look for HealthEquity to clear the buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

While **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) may not be as widely known as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), it does have at least one thing in common with them: They all made Forbes' list of the [fastest growing public tech companies](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/59234347a7ea434078d44581/12-epam-systems/#160d2bcc7e16).




**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) and [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)) were also on the list for 2017, the most recent report.


Facebook, Arista Networks and Salesforce are also all on the [IBD Big Cap 20 screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), and Grubhub earns a spot on both the [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) lists.


While Salesforce, Grubhub, Paycom, Arista Networks and Veeva have already broken out and are now out of buy range, Facebook and LogMeIn are setting up potential bases, and Epam broke out Friday and remains within buy range.


No. 1 Tech Services Stock
-------------------------


Founded in 1993, Epam Systems is an engineering services firm serving customers in over 25 countries. The Pennsylvania-based company reached $1 billion in annual sales for the first time last year.


Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in its A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.7 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership. Top-rated mutual fund Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) owns approximately 1.3% of Epam's shares.


Epam's highest-possible 99 Composite Rating earns it top billing in the tech services industry group, ahead of **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)), **Virtusa** ([VRTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTU)) and **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)). The group ranks No. 29 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

CLOSE




Epam, which came in at No. 12 on Forbes' list, has posted four straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a jump from 21% to 31% in the fourth quarter. Revenue gains have ranged from 20% to 32% over the last eight reports, helping drive a three-year annual growth rate of 26%.


Grubhub, which topped the list, has grown revenue at an annual 37% pace over the last three years, while Facebook (50%), Veeva (31%), Arista Networks (40%), LogMeIn (59%) and Salesforce (25%) have also shown solid top-line gains.


Breaks Out Into Buy Zone
------------------------


On Friday, Epam rose 3% to pop into a 119.28 to 125.24 buy zone from a second-stage flat base, closing the week at 122.044. As you like to see on the day of a breakout, the relative strength line spiked into new high ground.


Epam added to those gains Monday, rising just under 2% to close at 124.91.



After pulling back in February, Facebook has been consolidating and is now back above its 50-day line, gaining 1.6% on Friday. Facebook was down marginally Monday.


LogMeIn has shown similar action as it also tries to complete a new chart pattern. It was up over 5% last week and added another 1.2% on Monday.

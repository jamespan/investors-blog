With an aging population and billions of medical prescriptions given each year in the U.S. alone, Big Pharma and managed care organizations are focusing on health care technology that improves medication safety. Those demographic and industry trends make **Tabula Rasa Healthcare** ([TRHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRHC)) one of the top health care stocks to watch.




In the U.S., there are 45 to 50 million adverse drug events (ADEs) annually, and imprecise medication use is the fourth leading cause of death in the country. In addition to causing over 100,000 fatalities each year, ADEs lead to over one million emergency room visits annually.


Tabula Rasa aims to reduce those numbers with health care technology that optimizes medication regimens, improves patient outcomes and reduces the risk of ADEs. Its technology enables health care organizations to obtain real-time information on the medication's effectiveness and safety for a particular patient.


Tabula Rasa works with a wide range of health care payers, providers and health plans, including Medicare Advantage Part D Plans.

Health Care Technology Equals Healthy Profits
---------------------------------------------


Aside from a 10% decline in the fourth quarter of last yea, Tabula Rasa Healthcare has delivered exceptional earnings growth over the last eight reports, including six quarters of triple-digit gains.


Earnings growth has accelerated in each of the last two quarters. Analysts expect that trend to continue with a 200% rise in earnings when the company reports Q3 numbers, expected in early November.


Sales growth has also been impressive. Revenue gains have ranged from 31% to 65% over the last eight quarters.


Tabula Rasa Healthcare has earned a 98 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The stock earns the No. 3 ranking in the medical software group. **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Simulations Plus** ([SLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLP)) share the No. 1 spot with the highest-possible 99 rating.


The industry group ranks No. 10 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Institutional investors have taken note of Tabula Rasa Healthcare. The stock has seen eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership. Forty-two of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-analyst-estimates-eps-growth/) with an A+rating have a position in the stock.


Health Care Stocks To Watch
---------------------------


Tabula Rasa Healthcare had its IPO in September 2016. As many [new IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-dropbox-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/) do, it struggled out of the gate. But it found its footing with a breakout from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in August 2017. That move launched a 472% run over the next 13 months.


During that climb, the stock was featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-ipo-tabula-rasa-healthcare-may-follow-facebook-footsteps/) in January of this year. The breakout that came that week ended up failing, as the stock fell more than 8% below the buy point. But Tabula Rasa found support at its 10-week line and quickly zoomed higher.


Since peaking in September of this year, the stock has been forming a third-stage consolidation. Such later-stage bases are more risky, even more so given that the [general market is in a correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970).


But if the market turns around and Tabula Rasa Healthcare delivers another strong quarter when it reports Q3 numbers, the stock may be poised for a healthy pop.


On Tuesday, Tabula Rasa bounced back from an initial dip to notch a 0.8% gain and retake its 50-day moving average. Volume was above average and rising.

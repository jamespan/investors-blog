Today we'll check in on IBD 50 member **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), which we last featured on May 1.

  

Based in Singapore, Avago designs chips for the telecom, automotive, computer and other markets. Their products are used in a wide range of applications, including cell phones, factory automation, data networking and alternative energy systems.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Demand for those products has driven five consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth, including a jump to 97% in the latest report.

  

Earnings have followed a similar trajectory, with a 70% increase last quarter.

  

Avago is expected to release its latest numbers in early December.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 61%, followed by a 37% gain in 2015.

  

The company pays a dividend yielding 1.5% and sports a strong 28% return on equity.

  

Its Electronics â€” Semiconductors Fabless industry group ranks No. 27 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

All that helps Avago earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

Institutional demand in the stock is reflected in its B- Accumulation/Distribution, 1.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio, and the nice rise in the number of funds that own Avago in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

When we last featured Avago Technologies in the IBD Stock Analysis on May 1, it was still working on a flat base. It broke out the following week and rose 38% in just over four months.

  

The stock then began pulling back in September and is now working on a new consolidation.

  

The current base is V-shaped. You'd prefer to see a smoother, rounded formation, but we've seen a number of these V-shaped pattern recently because they reflect similar action in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

  

On Aug. 29, Avago gapped up after reporting accelerating earnings and sales growth. It closed over 7% higher on volume 254% above average.

  

That was followed by a big gap down on Oct. 10, which was a rough day for virtually all chip stocks since analysts feared the semiconductor industry was entering a new down cycle.

  

But Avago found a bottom just above its 40-week line and has since built the right side of its base.

  

The buy point is 90.98, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if Avago can push past that price on volume at least 40% - 50% higher than normal, and keep an eye out for the company's latest earnings report, expected in early December.

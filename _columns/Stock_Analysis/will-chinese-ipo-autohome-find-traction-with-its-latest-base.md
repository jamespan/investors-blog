Today we'll check in on **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), a recent Chinese IPO that provides independent reviews and other content for car buyers via autohome.com.

  

The company was featured in Wednesday's [Sector Leaders Review](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/102114-722806-autohome-is-forming-a-new-base.htm).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Autohome has posted several quarters of strong sales growth, ranging from 67% to 100% over the last five reports.

  

Earnings growth has also been strong, but more sporadic, with two quarters of 0% gains in the last four reports.

  

Keep that in mind as we wait for Autohome to announce Q3 numbers, which is expected to happen around Nov. 10.

  

For the full year, analysts see EPS gains of 72%, followed by a 35% rise in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised downward.

  

The company sports a solid 21% return on equity and several strong ratings.

  

Its Internet â€” Content industry group earns a 93 Group RS Rating and currently ranks No. 15 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

Overall, Autohome earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and a solid A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

As Vincent Mao noted in the Sector Leaders Review column, it can be tough to find hiqh-quality sponsorship in Chinese stocks. But leading growth fund T Rowe Price New Horizons initiated a position in the third quarter, and hedge fund Tiger Global Management unveiled a big stake in the stock, with 6.74 million shares out of 112 million shares outstanding.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public in Dec. 2013, Autohome formed a deep, 24-week cup, correcting as much as 45%.

  

Although it did show signs of accumulation as it formed the right side of that base, it wasn't able to launch a new run.

  

It flashed a nasty reversal on the same week it broke out, and began forming a new base.

  

On the positive side, the current pattern is much shallower than the prior formation, and the stock is now back above its 10-week line. Also, Autohome has shown good relative strength recently, which is reflected in its rising RS line.

  

If the stock does not form a handle, the ideal point would be 58.03, 10 cents above the peak on the left. If it does form a handle, the ideal buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

  

With the general market now back in an uptrend, Autohome may be one to watch. If it does break out, make sure it does so on heavy volume, and if it quickly reverses as it did before, be sure to take defensive action.

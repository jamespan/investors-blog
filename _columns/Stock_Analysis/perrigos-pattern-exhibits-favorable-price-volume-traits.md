Oftentimes, a pullback to the 10-week moving average becomes a base, and that's the case with **Perrigo** ([PRGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGO)).

  

Rather than bouncing from the 10-week line, the drugmaker has continued to trade below that line and has been consolidating for seven weeks 1.

  

The trading has been fairly orderly and controlled within this consolidation, with some tight weekly closes. That indicates that, at least so far, institutional investors have not been aggressively dumping shares and perhaps buying some.

  

Most bases form during a correction, so Perrigo's current chart action is not unusual.

  

Volume has been light as the base rounds out its bottom 2, which is a positive sign.

  

The Relative Strength line is near a new high 3, which also bodes well for the base.

  

Watch to see if the stock can complete a proper base and breakout.

  

But keep two things in mind.

  

First, this would be a third-stage base for Perrigo, and while those can work, late-stage bases are more risky.

  

Second, don't buy stocks while the market is still in a correction.

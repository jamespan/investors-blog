**Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) was among the specialty drug makers and biotech stocks that got clobbered this week after [Hillary Clinton sent a tweet](http://news.investors.com/technology/092115-771997-clinton-drug-price-announcement-rattles-drug-stocks.htm) accusing Big Pharma of price gouging.

  

In reaction to the Democratic front-runner's comments, Valeant fell 5% Monday.

  

Its misery found plenty of company: **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) (-5.6%), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) (-2.5%), **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) (-3.8%), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) (-2.3%), **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) (-3.2%) and **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) (-9.2%) also fell.

  

On Tuesday, Clinton outlined her plan to cap the out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions, and drugmakers continued to struggle.

  

A question is how much long-term impact Clinton's comments will have.

  

Plus, selling pressure and uncertainty in the general market contributed to the decline of pharmaceutical stocks.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Despite this week's drop, Valeant's strong fundamentals mean it's one to keep an eye on.

  

Sales growth has accelerated in each of the past two quarters, and earnings growth has come in at 20% to 76% in the past eight reports.

  

It's expected to release Q3 numbers on Oct. 19.

  

The Quebec-based company has made [over 100 acquisitions](http://news.investors.com/technology/092315-772356-facebook-starbucks-valeant-big-cap-acquisitions.htm) since merging with Biovail in 2010. It sports a stellar 55% return on equity and 39% annual EPS growth rate.

  

Overall Valeant earns a 97 Composite Rating.

  

But its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E reflects how the stock has been correcting in recent weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Valeant Pharmaceuticals' current base highlights three important chart-reading concepts.

  

First, the stock [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern. That makes the current consolidation a first-stage base.

  

Second, Valeant's recent action highlights how the 10-week moving average acts as a first line of defense.

  

The stock failed to hold that line this week, and now we'll see if it can hold its ground at the second line of defense â€” the 40-week moving average.

  

The third point is the concept of support and resistance.

  

After the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle last December, it consistently found support along the 10-week line.

  

That came to an end last month, when it fell below that benchmark and closed at the bottom of its price range on rising volume.

  

Since then, the 10-week line has changed from a floor of support into a ceiling of resistance.

  

So see if Valeant Pharmaceuticals can find support at the 40-week line, get back above the 10-week moving average, then complete its current base by punching through the former area of resistance around 263 on heavy volume.

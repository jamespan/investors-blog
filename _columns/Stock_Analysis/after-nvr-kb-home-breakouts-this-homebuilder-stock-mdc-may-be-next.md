Led by breakouts from **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), the homebuilder industry group ranks No. 8 out of 197 groups. Now Denver-based **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) may be ready to launch its own move.


So far, [top homebuilder stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) have not been rattled by [Federal Reserve interest rate hikes](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/will-higher-rates-hurt-homebuilders-this-chart-gives-a-clue/), as evidenced by the continued climb of NVR, KB Homes and other industry leaders.


On Friday, new home sales for May showed a 2.8% rise to a seasonally adjusted 610,000 units. The Commerce Department also gave an upward revision to its earlier numbers for April, from 569,000 units to 593,000.


After the close Tuesday, [KB Home reported fiscal second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/kb-home-earnings-due-with-these-4-builders-near-buy-points/), beating estimates for both earnings and sales.


126% Earnings Growth
--------------------


With operations across multiple states, including Colorado, California, Arizona and Maryland, MDC's subsidiaries have been building residential properties under the Richmond American Homes name since 1972.









 
 
  The company's 126% EPS gain in Q1 and 93% average growth over the last three quarters helps earn it the No. 2 ranking among its industry peers. NVR holds the top spot, with **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)), **MI Homes** ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) and Toll Bros. rounding out the top five homebuilder stocks.
MDC's first-quarter sales growth jumped 42%, up from 27% in the prior report.


The company also pays a dividend currently yielding 2.9% on an annualized basis.


While NVR was the only homebuilder to make IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-light-up-on-lumentum-add-stamps-com/), MDC has also attracted institutional demand, as reflected in its 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and three straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Constructing New Breakout?
--------------------------


MDC has been building steppingstones in the form of chart patterns while rising steadily from a low of 21.25 it hit last November.


The stock began forming the initial leg of a first-stage base-on-base formation in December, started another in March and has been working on the third leg of the pattern — a flat base — since May.


All three consolidations are considered part of the same base-on-base pattern because each time MDC broke out, it failed to rise more than 20% before pulling back to start a new formation.


The new buy point is 36.09, 10 cents above the peak on the left of the flat base.


Despite a sell-off in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, MDC moved up Tuesday, closing over 1% higher in rising and above-average volume. Its relative strength line was also closing in on new high ground as the stock ended the day just 1% below the buy point.


See if the market rebounds from Tuesday's selling pressure and see how MDC and other homebuilders react to the KB Home's positive earnings report.

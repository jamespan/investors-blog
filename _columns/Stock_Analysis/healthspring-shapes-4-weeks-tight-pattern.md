Managed care provider **HealthSpring** ([HS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HS)) has found support at its 10-week moving average 1 and also shaped a four-weeks-tight pattern 2.

  

The potential buy point for the four-weeks-tight is at 45.21. Watch for the stock to clear that level in strong volume. But keep in mind that you want to be careful about buying stocks during a correction.

  

This is the second time that HealthSpring has tested its 10-week line since it broke out of a base in early April 3. It was a short pattern, although it also could have been interpreted as a cup with a high handle.

  

Its first 10-week pullback since that breakout came in late April 4.

  

With the current pullback, volume has been somewhat light 5 . That's encouraging. It indicates that big investors are not aggressively selling the stock.

  

HealthSpring, based in Franklin, Tenn., has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+, indicating moderate buying by institutional investors in recent months.

  

U.S. mutual and hedge funds own about 61% of shares, and the number of funds with a stake has been rising in recent quarters.

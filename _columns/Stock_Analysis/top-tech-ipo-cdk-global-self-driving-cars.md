Self-driving cars and related technology from **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and others may get all the buzz, but there's one thing autonomous vehicles don't do: sell themselves. That's where **CDK Global** ([CDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDK)) may step in to help.


The Illinois-based tech company provides digital marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) services for automotive dealerships in more thanÂ 100 countries and for most automakers.


CDK's solutions streamline all aspects of the car-buying process for both dealers and shoppers, from selection, sales and financing to marketing, maintenance and insurance.


Mixed Signals
-------------


CDK Global generates over $2 billion in annual revenue, but sales growth has been in the single digits or flat for the past 13 quarters.


Earnings growth has been more impressive, ranging from 26% to 75% over the last four reports.


The stock's 82 Composite Rating is below the 90 or higher score you'd prefer, but CDK has seen six straight quarters of rising fund ownership and sports a strong 49% return on equity.


Analysts expect EPS to rise 34% in fiscal 2017, which ends in June, followed by a 24% rise in fiscal 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


**May Test Drive New Buy Point**
--------------------------------


CDK revved up a nice run soon after its October 2014 IPO, but since then has continued to hit long-term resistance just under 60.



It is testing that ceiling again as it closed Tuesday at 59.91, just below a 60.19 flat base.


The 10-day moving average has climbed back above the 50-day line, a sign of renewed technical strength.


See if CDK Global can decisively motor through that ceiling of resistance in heavy volume and turn into a floor of support for another sustained climb.

**Alliance Data Systems** ([ADS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADS)) provides transaction, credit and marketing services to over 1,300 consumer-based businesses worldwide.

  

Last month, they announced a new mobile loyalty suite and app for retailers. The app lets customers apply for a store-brand credit card, then shop, redeem rewards and make payments using the Mobile Virtual Card on their mobile device.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has been fairly consistent, ranging from 15% to 23% the past eight quarters.

  

Earnings growth has shown somewhat larger swings, but has accelerated in the past two reports, coming in at 30% in Q3.

  

For 2014, analysts expect earnings to rise 24%, followed by a 21% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Alliance has a strong 97% return on equity, but a debt-to-equity ratio of 850%. High debt loads can get a company into trouble, especially if the economy slows down.

  

Overall, the stock earns a solid 98 Composite Rating and B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

From January 2011 through March 2014, Alliance shares more than quadrupled, from around 71 to just over 300.

  

The stock has spent the past eight months working on a double bottom that has now formed a handle. The buy point is 286.90.

  

In a double bottom, the second leg down should undercut the low in the first leg down, and Alliance did do that, albeit by just 25 cents.

  

The stock rebounded from that new low on strong volume and quickly recaptured its 10-week line.

  

See if Alliance Data Systems can punch through its 286.90 buy point on volume at least 40% to 50% above average.

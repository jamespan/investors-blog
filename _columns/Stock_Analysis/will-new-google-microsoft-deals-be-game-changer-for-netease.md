Chinese online gaming leader **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) has announced new deals with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google as its stock may be setting up for a new run.


In 2014, Microsoft paid $2.5 billion for Mojang, the maker of "Minecraft," a game where players dig and build structures and explore a variety of 3D terrains and habitats. 


Last week, Microsoft said it signed a five-year deal to have NetEase distribute PC-based and mobile versions of the game in China. 


The massively popular "Minecraft," which has over 100 million registered users, is a valuable addition to NetEase's lineup of in-house and licensed games, which includes exclusive Chinese rights to "World of Warcraft" from **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)).


**Turning Daydream Into Virtual Reality**
-----------------------------------------


Earlier this month, NetEase also announced that its virtual reality game "Twilight Pioneers" will be one of the first games for Daydream, a new VR platform from Google that is built on top of the Android operating system.


NetEase said it believes "the immersive experience of VR gaming is a game changer with tremendous market potential."


NetEase is the top-ranked stock among its peers in the video game software industry, including **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)), Activision Blizzard and **Take-Two Interactive Software** ([TTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTWO)). 


NetEase has also pulled off a feat that few stocks accomplish: earning passing ratings in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) for every fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria, except industry group rank.


Earnings growth has averaged 65% over the last three quarters, and revenue rose 108% in the latest report.


**Crafting New Base**
---------------------


NetEase is working on the right side of cup-shaped pattern. The current buy point is 186.55, but the stock may form a handle to offer an earlier entry.

But later-stage patterns can launch solid gains, and NetEase has shown signs of institutional buying within the base, including multiple up weeks in heavy volume. It also sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.3 up/down volume ratio.


The number of funds with a position in NetEase has jumped sharply in recent quarters, from 467 in the second quarter of 2015 to 714 in the first quarter of this year.

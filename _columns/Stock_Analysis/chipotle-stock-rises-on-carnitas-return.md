With its carnitas carnage mostly behind it, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) has once again been on the upswing. From January into July, Chipotle's mission of Food with Integrity meant a menu without carnitas, since the fast-casual restaurant chain was no longer able to find suppliers to provide pork that met its animal welfare standards.

  

That helped push the stock lower, but [Chipotle has found a new supplier](http://news.investors.com/investing/080715-765705-chipotle-bent-on-fast-expansion.htm), UK-based Karro Food, and the popular carnitas burritos and bowls have returned to the menu at a growing number of its over 1,500 locations.

  

Chipotle's rebound has also helped improve the ranking of the Retail—Restaurants industry group, which includes **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)), **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)), **Chuy's Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)) and **Zoe's Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)). From a No. 62 ranking three months ago, the group has moved up the ladder to the No. 36 spot.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

On July 21, [Chipotle posted mixed results for Q2](http://news.investors.com/business/072215-762849-chipotle-shares-hit-record-after-earnings-q3-traffic-up.htm), just beating on earnings estimates, but just missing on revenue.

  

CFO Jack Hartung said sales growth was hampered by the company's reluctance to raise menu prices at locations where carnitas entrees were still not available, for fear of further upsetting customers. But future price hikes could help Chipotle's top and bottom line growth.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 23%, followed by a 19% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Chipotle sports a 25% return on equity and a solid 98 Composite Rating.

  

The A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.0 Up/Down Volume Ratio point to strong institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After posting four weeks of tight, healthy trading to kick off the New Year, Chipotle sold off on Q4 earnings that showed weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth.

  

It spent much of the next several months below the 10-week line as it formed a new base. It's a first-stage pattern since the new low undercut the low in the prior consolidation.

  

Chipotle regained the 10-week moving average as it built the right side of the base, then shot higher when it reported Q2 earnings in July.

  

That pushed it past a 699.13 buy point, calculated by adding 10 cents to an earlier point of resistance.

  

Volume in the lead up to the breakout was strong, and spiked even higher on Chipotle's earnings report.

  

You could also view an earlier point of resistance as another buy point benchmark, creating a 728.07 entry.

  

Since also clearing that price, Chipotle has held on to its gains and is now working on week No. 3 of a potential three-weeks-tight pattern.

  

Keep in that mind that, given the choppy, seesaw action of the current market, you want to be very picky about — and closely watch — any new buys.

The stock market has come under selling pressure the past week, but investors should continue to track top-rated stocks in top-ranked industry groups. And **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) fits that bill.


The maker of cloud-based human capital management solutions holds the No. 1 slot within the No. 7-ranked enterprise software industry group.


**Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)), **Synchronoss Technologies** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)), **Aspen Technology** ([AZPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZPN)) and **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) round out the top five stocks in the group.


Top Mutual Funds Buying Shares
------------------------------


Paycom and Ebix both made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-put-the-pedal-to-the-metal-with-gibraltar/), with 14 funds investing a total of $64 million between July and September. Nine funds picked up $2.3 million worth of shares in Ebix during the same period.


Among the reasons Paycom appeals to fund managers is its 117% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, 46% three-year annual sales growth rate and 27.2% return on equity. Plus, Paycom's estimated 94% EPS growth for this year is the [highest among IBD's Sector Leaders](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/how-big-will-the-2016-2017-earnings-increases-be-for-major-stock-leaders/).


The Oklahoma-based company, which has over 12,000 clients across the U.S., is expected to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 1.


Finding Support Or Hitting Resistance?
--------------------------------------


After bottoming out from a sharp decline, Paycom has been rising steadily since February, finding support along its 10-week moving average.



The stock is now forming a new flat base, showing tight weekly closes in the bottom of the pattern. But it's not clear if that benchmark line will continue to provide a floor of support or turn into a ceiling of resistance. The stock showed resilience Thursday by bouncing back to close just below the 10-week moving average.


The potential buy point is 53.03, but be sure to also keep a close eye on the action of the major indexes.  Breakouts have the greatest chance of success when the general market is in a more solid uptrend.

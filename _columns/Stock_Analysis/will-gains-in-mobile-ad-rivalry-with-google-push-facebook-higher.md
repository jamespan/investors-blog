Â    



While **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) trails **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) in terms of mobile ad revenue, it's been picking up ground recently. Its share of mobile ad dollars will rise to 18.4% in 2014 from 16.6% last year. Google's slice of the pie is expected to slip from 46.6% in 2013 to 40.5% this year.

  

Nomura Securities recently said Facebook will also step up investments in original content to better compete with YouTube and others in streaming video.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Facebook continues to post solid sales growth, ranging from 38% to 72% over the past eight quarters.

  

Earnings growth slowed in Q3 after two quarters of triple-digit gains, but remained strong at 59%.

  

Analysts expect EPS to rise 90% this year, then slow to 13% in 2015. Estimates for next year were revised lower recently.

  

Facebook's 17% return on equity meets the minimum benchmark you look for, and overall it earns a 96 Composite Rating. It currently has a C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, but that's up from D- four weeks ago. See if it continues to improve as the stock tries to complete the current consolidation.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Facebook is in the eighth week of a first-stage flat base. It's first stage because the stock undercut the low in the prior pattern in October to reset the count.

  

After gapping down Oct. 29 on earnings, Facebook recaptured its 10-week line as it built the right side of its base, finding support at that benchmark line again this week.

  

The buy point is 81.26, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

See if the overall market can rebound into an uptrend, and if Facebook can break past that entry in heavy volume.

Leading Chinese internet stock **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) was first [featured in the IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/two-factors-driving-explosive-growth-for-the-twitter-of-china/) on March 24, 2016, just before it launched a massive move. The so-called Twitter of China is now testing a new buy point, but with one important caveat.









 
 
 Like [fellow Chinese stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)), Weibo has risen sharply over the last year or longer, while forming multiple bases along the way.
Weibo, Alibaba and 58.com are all now in or near a new buy zone, but those buy points are from later-stage bases. Such consolidations involve more risk since by the time a late-stage base forms, the stock has already made a big run. In the case of Weibo, it has risen as much as 564% from the initial breakout in April 2016.


But such later-stage patterns can launch solid gains, especially when the stock's relative strength line hits new high ground at the time of the breakout, as was, temporarily, the case for Weibo.


Be sure to also keep an eye on the general market. While the [Dow Jones industrial average jumped past 26,000 today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/), it has since pulled back. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have also retreated from earlier gains.


Strong gains at the open, followed by pullbacks at the close can be a sign of a weakening market. Continue to [check the Market Pulse each day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) for alerts to any changes in market direction.


174% EPS Growth
---------------


Weibo has delivered average earnings growth of 174% over the last three quarters, including a 113% gain in Q3. Analysts are looking for a 70% increase when the company reports Q4 earnings toward the end of February.


The company has exceptional three-year annuals growth rates for both EPS (317%) and revenue (81%).


Signs of continued institutional demand are mixed. Weibo sports a solid B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.2 up/down volume ratio, but the number of funds with a position in the stock remained flat last quarter. Time will tell if that means fund managers are starting to back off, thinking that the stock is may be due for correction.


Late-Stage Buy Zone
-------------------


Weibo came into Tuesday's session trading just below a 123.10 buy point in a fourth-stage cup with handle. The stock gapped up in the morning in strong volume to jump into buy range, which extends to 129.26.


But then Weibo pulled back before managing to close just above the buy point. Since it is a later-stage breakout, it's especially important to have defensive sell rules in case the stock fails to build on the breakout attempt.



[IBD 50 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) Alibaba came close to clearing a 191.85 entry in early trade, but then pulled back to close down nearly 3%. But the retail giant did manage to stay above its  50-day line.


58.com has also retreated from morning gains and is once again testing the 79.89 entry it initially cleared on Jan. 5.


Autohome broke out of an early-stage base on the first day of trading this year and is now extended, having already climbed about 21% above the buy point. On Tuesday, the stock fared better than its fellow Chinese stocks, managing to hold on to a nearly 5% gain despite giving back a chunk of its earlier advance.

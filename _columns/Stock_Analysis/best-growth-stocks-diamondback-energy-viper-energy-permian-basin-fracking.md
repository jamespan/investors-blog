Exploring New Buy Zone
----------------------


Diamondback Energy briefly cleared a 131.68 cup-with-handle entry Friday as its relative strength line reached new high ground. But late selling in the broad market also hit Diamondback, which pushed the stock back below the buy point.


But on Monday, the stock bounced back to rise over 4% and enter the 131.68 to 138.25. Preliminary volume was around 20% above average.



In early February, Diamondback sold off sharply, along with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, while building the left side of its base. That heavy-volume decline, plus a string of lower-volume up weeks in the chart pattern, is why Diamondback Energy still has a lackluster C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 0.7 up/down volume ratio.


While you want to see both of those metrics improve as Diamondback tries build on its breakout move, it has shown other signs of institutional demand, including eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Also note that several [top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) own shares in Diamondback Energy, such as T.Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)) and Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).

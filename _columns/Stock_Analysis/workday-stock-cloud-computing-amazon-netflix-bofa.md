According to Workday's website, Netflix uses its software to handle HR, payroll and financials in one application. Amazon uses Workday's human capital management (HCM) system to manage the e-commerce giant's hiring of employees around the world. Travel-related content provider **TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) also uses [Workday's HCM solutions](https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/en-us/documents/case-studies/workday-tripadvisor-case-study.pdf) to manage its hiring and payment needs across multiple subsidiaries and websites in over 20 languages.


In June, Workday announced it will [acquire Adaptive Insights](https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details.html?id=3379153) and its Business Planning Cloud platform for approximately $1.55 billion. Adaptive Insights provides a new generation of business planning solutions for more than 3,800 organizations globally.


While Workday's earnings growth has decelerated recently, the company has posted average EPS growth of 110% over the last three quarters. Revenue gains have ranged from 29% to 41% over the last eight reports.


While Workday stock currently has a moderate C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, it has seen six straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 155 mutual funds with an A+ rating own shares in Workday, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Fidelity OTC (FOCPX). Workday's up/down volume ratio has improved to 1.3.


Workday Stock Tests Buy Zone
----------------------------


Workday is testing a 137.53 buy point in a cup with handle. It's considered a first-stage base because the most recent low undercut the low in the prior pattern. The stock has been testing the entry in recent days, and its relative strength line is within striking distance of a new 52-week high.


On Tuesday, Workday again floated in and out of the 137.53 to 144.41 buy zone. It closed the day up 0.2% to 137.40 in light volume.



Since clearing a 118.55 buy point by soaring 23% during the week ended Aug. 3, Paycom Software has been consolidating those gains in tight trading. It rose 2.4% on Tuesday. Workday client Amazon continues to climb higher, but Netflix has pulled back from a big breakout in May and is now testing support at the original 338.92 buy point. It closed below the entry Tuesday.


Like Netflix, TripAdvisor has retreated after breaking out in May, but it did manage to find support at and stay above its initial buy point.

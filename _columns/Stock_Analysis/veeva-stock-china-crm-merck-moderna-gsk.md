Already partnering with Big Pharma powerhouses like **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **GSK** ([GSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) — a provider of cloud-based software for the life sciences industry — has just teamed up with [six of the top 20 biopharmas](https://www.veeva.com/resources/top-global-biopharmas-standardize-on-veeva-china-crm-suite/) to advance engagement with health care professionals in China. That has sparked new demand for the artificial-intelligence-fueled firm, helping Veeva stock close in on a new breakout.


Sporting a 1.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership, [Veeva](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-veeva-systems-cl-a-veev.aspx) has earned a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) lists. While it did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/apple-stock-meta-robinhood-walmart-lead-new-buys-by-best-mutual-funds/), an impressive 112 funds with an A+ rating from Investor's Business Daily have a position in Veeva stock.




Veeva Expands CRM Platform In China
-----------------------------------


Based in Pleasanton, Calif., Veeva works with clients ranging from the world's largest biopharmaceutical companies to emerging biotechs. The company offers a cloud-based and [AI-fueled](https://www.veeva.com/meet-veeva/partners/ai/) platform to support its clients' drug development and commercialization efforts. Veeva's technology provides customer relationship management, or CRM, as well as data management, content management and other solutions.


On March 3, the company announced that six of the world's top 20 biopharmas have chosen [Veeva China CRM Suite](https://www.veeva.com/cn/veeva-china-crm-suite-en/) to enhance interaction with medical industry professionals in that Asian nation. Part of the Veeva Commercial Cloud, this software package includes applications specific to the nation, including China CRM, China Events Management, Approved WeChat, China Engage, and China Campaign Manager.


Solid and steady earnings and sales growth has helped lift Veeva onto one of [IBD's top stock screens](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). Over the last seven quarters, the company has posted revenue gains ranging from 10% to 24%. In its latest earnings report on March 5, Veeva posted a 14% year-over-year rise in revenue to $729.9 million.


During the same period, quarterly earnings growth has ranged from 17% to 66%. Its March 5 report showed 26% earnings growth to $1.74 per share.


Veeva Stock Battles To Bounce Back And Break Out
------------------------------------------------


After hitting an all-time high in 2021, shares of Veeva retreated into a multiyear slump. Since bottoming out in October 2022, the stock has followed a bumpy, sideways path.


Veeva stock has now formed an early-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 247.62.


While the relative strength line has dipped as the handle has formed, Veeva remains above its 50-day moving average. As investors like to see, the shorter-term [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) stands above the longer-term 50-day line.


As Veeva continues to navigate a bumpy road to a potential breakout, keep the action of the Nasdaq and other [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) in mind. Just as Veeva is weathering some turbulence, the general market is also fighting to launch a sustained new uptrend.


In this environment of trying to rebound from a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-corrections-how-to-sell-stocks-manage-risk-and-prepare-for-next-uptrend/), it can take multiple attempts before the indexes and individual stocks gain traction and launch new runs.

With investors looking to cash in on a record high, banking giant **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) remains in buy range after beating Wall Street estimates. Fellow forces of finance **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) have also reported. [JPMorgan](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-jpmorgan-chase-jpm.aspx)Â and [Goldman Sachs](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-goldman-sachs-gs.aspx) are just two bank stocks in or near buy range.




JPMorgan, Goldman Lead Banks In Buy Range
-----------------------------------------


As the Dow Jones Industrial Average shakes off pressure to pop back above the 40,000 mark, component JPMorgan remains in buy range. It initially cleared a 205.88 entry in a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) on July 1, ahead of its earnings report on July 12.


After [beating Wall Street estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/jpm-stock-jpmorgan-earnings-citigroup-wells-fargo/), shares initially fell, but immediately found support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The stock then spiked to a record high on July 17 before pulling back. Since then, JPMorgan Chase has shown resilience and healthy chart action. On Friday, the stock rose nearly 2%, closing with the buy zone which extends to 216.74.


A strong 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) shows JPMorgan Chase is outpacing 95% of all stocks in terms of key stock-picking factors.


Hailing from the same Banks-Money Center industry group, Goldman Sachs slightly tops JPMorgan with a 97 Composite Rating. Like its industry peer, GS stock spiked to a record high after reporting earnings. GS stock has climbed just beyond buy range as it tests the 500 per share mark.


More Bank Stocks Setting Up
---------------------------


Given the strength of leading bank stocks like JPMorgan, Goldman, Bank of America and others, it's no surprise that the Group RS Rating is a strong A-. The group also ranks in the Top 40 of the 197 industries IBD tracks.


BAC stock has pulled back from a record high but remains extended. BlackRock and Morgan Stanley are in buy range, while Wells Fargo looks to cash in with a breakout from a flat base.


JPMorgan Chase, Other Banks Hike Dividends After Stress Tests
-------------------------------------------------------------


Under the JPMorgan and Chase brands, the company serves millions of customers in the U.S. Clients also include many of the world's largest corporations, institutions and governments.


On June 28, the Federal Reserve announced that all 23 major banks passed their stress test. They also all remained above their minimum capital requirements during a hypothetical recession. That was the scenario despite total projected losses of $541 billion.


Including JPMorgan, a number of banks boosted dividends and buybacks following results of the annual stress tests. JPMorgan hiked its dividend to $1.25 from $1.15 per share. It also authorized a $30 billion stock buyback.


Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citi, and Morgan Stanley also boosted their dividends.

When you think of artificial intelligence stocks, names like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) come to mind. But as AI weaves its way across all industries, **Ralph Lauren** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)) stock has fashioned its own use of this powerful technology.


Boosted by exceptional demand from top fund managers, Ralph Lauren stands ready to launch a fresh breakout to a record high.




Ralph Lauren In Fashion And In Demand
-------------------------------------


With Nvidia, Apple and Google once again absent, Meta Platforms was the only [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) to make December's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/palantir-stock-cintas-lead-new-buys-by-best-mutual-funds/).


Yet Ralph Lauren also shined brightly on this screen, raking in an impressive $781 million. Further showcasing demand, [Ralph Lauren stock sports](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ralph-lauren-cl-a-rl.aspx) a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.4 up/down volume ratio.


Plus, the fashion icon sports eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


With a 91 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Ralph Lauren tops all its industry peers, including Coach parent **Tapestry** ([TPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPR)) and **Victoria's Secret** ([VSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VSCO)).

Taking Stock Of AI Trends
-------------------------


Based in New York, Ralph Lauren offers luxury lifestyle products. It operates across five categories: apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances and hospitality. Brands include Polo Ralph Lauren, Chaps and more.


Earlier this year, Ralph Lauren expanded its [AI-driven intelligent inventory technology](https://consumergoods.com/ralph-lauren-expands-intelligent-inventory-pilot-and-pushes-dtc). In the U.S., that move builds on a pilot program initiated in its European and Asian stores.


The use of AI helps the company drive sales by improving in-stock availability on sizing and bestselling products. Over time, Ralph Lauren plans to roll out this predictive buying model across a wide range of categories and markets.


Ralph Lauren Stock On Runway To Breakout
----------------------------------------


Having soared since bottoming out in 2022 and [resetting its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/), Ralph Lauren stands poised to pop into the limelight again. After rising for a fifth straight day Thursday, the stock pulled back Friday as the Nasdaq came under pressure. But Ralph Lauren has so far held support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It closed the week 3% shy of a 236.16 buy point in a consolidation pattern.


Showing market leadership, the fashion brand's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) trades right around a 52-week high, earning a coveted [blue dot in MarketSurge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/).


Nvidia — [Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nvidia-stock-early-buy-point/) — failed to hold its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on Friday after clinging to it on Thursday.


While teasing a return to buy range, Meta Platforms has slipped below its 21-day line but remains above its 50-day benchmark. Apple notched yet another record high this week before easing back on Friday. After climbing beyond its buy range this week, Google has also pulled back as the Nasdaq retreated.

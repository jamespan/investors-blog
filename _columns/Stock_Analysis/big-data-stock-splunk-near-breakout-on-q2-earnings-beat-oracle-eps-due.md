As **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) falls after beating estimates on earnings and sales but providing disappointing guidance, industry peer and Big Data stock **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) is trying to holds its ground and break out.


Oracle entered a new buy zone ahead of its report, but gapped down below the buy point Friday in heavy volume. Splunk was down fractionally in afternoon trade, but still within striking distance of a 68.95 entry.


Big Data, Big Earnings
----------------------









 
 
 Splunk is a market leader in cloud-based analytics for machine data, providing companies with operational intelligence to help them optimize their information technology (IT), security and business performance. The San Francisco-based company has more than 14,000 customers in over 110 countries.
Splunk has delivered strong annual growth for both earnings (187%) and sales (44%) over the last three years, and soundly beat analyst estimates for both the top and bottom lines in Q2, with gains of 32% and 60%, respectively.


Breakout Or Resistance?
-----------------------


Like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)),  **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and other [IPOs that get off to a rocky start](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/), Splunk struggled after going public in April 2012.


It formed two bases during its first 10 months on the market before rising over 200% in just one year from a February 2013 breakout.


Square, which is now [in a new buy zone](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/global-payments-sees-composite-rating-climb-to-96/), followed a similar trajectory following its November 2015 IPO before launching a nice run earlier this year.



On Aug. 25, Splunk gapped up on earnings to close more than 8% higher in volume 458% above average. The stock has managed to hold and add to those gains as it tries to complete a first-stage cup with handle with a 68.95 buy point.


Note that Splunk has hit resistance right around 65 to 69 many times over the past year, so see if it can punch through that ceiling in heavy volume to launch a new run.


In a sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-week moving average has moved back above the 40-week line.


On Friday, Splunk ended the week 2% below the potential buy point. Oracle fell over 7%, crashing below its 50-day line in the heaviest volume in months.

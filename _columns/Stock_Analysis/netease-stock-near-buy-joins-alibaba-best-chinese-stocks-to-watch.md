Earlier this month, [NetEase Cloud Music and Universal Music Group](http://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-cloud-music-and-universal-music-group-enter-licensing) signed a multiyear licensing agreement.


Under the agreement, NetEase Cloud Music will distribute UMG's music, including both domestic and international artists, on its streaming platform and associated digital services in China. Subscribers to NetEase Cloud Music get on-demand access to UMG's full catalog of artists.


NetEase Cloud Music and UMG will also team up to create campaigns and initiatives enabling music fans in China to engage with both domestic and international artists.


William Ding, CEO of NetEase, said the partnership "further strengthens NetEase Cloud Music's position as a go-to platform for high-quality international music and marks a great step forward for China's music industry as a whole."


The new agreement builds on the company's NetEase Games division, which develops and operates some of China's most popular mobile and PC-client games. Aiming to bolster its international presence in recent years, the games division has also expanded into overseas markets, including Japan and North America.


In addition to its in-house developed game content, NetEase partners with other leading game developers, including **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) subsidiary Mojang.

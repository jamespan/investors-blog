**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stands to cash in when "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" hits theaters Dec. 18. But **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) may become Kylo Ren-style nemeses of its traditional TV business.

  

The much-anticipated installment of the "Star Wars" series is expected to generate over $2 billion in worldwide box office receipts.

  

That's one reason Disney's stock has awoken from a recent sharp decline and is now trading around a new buy zone.

  

There are concerns, however, about the impact of over-the-top (OTT) TV services on the House of Mouse's cable properties, including ESPN, ABC Family and the Disney Channel.

  

But as RBC Capital Markets' David Bank told IBD in August, the sky isn't falling on the [pay-TV ecosystem](http://news.investors.com/business-industry-snapshot/082115-767706-netflix-subscriber-growth-old-media-weak-earnings.htm). While Netflix is eroding viewership for core TV, traditional television has its own brand of stickiness and isn't prone to change rapidly.

  

To help compete with Netflix and other online streaming services, Disney established Hulu with **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **21st Century Fox** ([FOXA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXA)), and also makes its channels available on Sling TV, owned by **Dish Network** ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)).

  

There's been speculation that **Time Warner** ([TWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWX)) would join the [anti-Netflix Hulu alliance](http://news.investors.com/technology/111715-781178-hulu-partnership-could-spark-doj-probe.htm), but such a move could invite antitrust scrutiny from the Department of Justice.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

On Nov. 5, Disney reported earnings growth of 35%, topping analyst estimates for its fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 3.

  

Sales rose 9% but came up just short of expectations. The company's cable and broadcast segment logged a 12% gain in revenue, and CEO Robert Iger said he's "bullish" on ESPN.

  

Analysts are looking for a 10% rise in earnings for fiscal 2016 and 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Disney's 95 Composite Rating is tops among its peers in the Media â€” Diversified industry group, ahead of No. 2 **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)).

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating has risen from the lowest-possible E in August to a more acceptable C, as Disney has recovered to build the right side of a new base.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Disney sold off in early August after reporting earnings, but it rebounded during the week of the Aug. 24 flash crash and regained the 10-week line in October.

  

The current cup-with-handle is a first-stage pattern, since the low in the consolidation undercut the low in the prior base.

  

Trading has tightened up in the right side of the base, compared to the heavy-volume sell-off in the left side of the pattern.

  

The buy point is 117.68, 10 cents above the peak in the handle. Disney closed above that price on Wednesday, but volume was 18% below average.

  

The buying range is 117.68 to 123.56.

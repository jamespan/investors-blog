Sometimes the best-known, most-followed tech stocks like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) don't necessarily produce the biggest gains. Switzerland-based **Mettler-Toledo International** ([MTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTD)) is a case in point.




Mettler-Toledo joins [MSFT stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) and [GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). All three of these top growth stocks have produced impressive gains since the start of a new bull market in March 2009.


But from the start of the 2009 bull market cycle until now, Mettler-Toledo has actually outpaced the stock price performance of Microsoft and Alphabet. During that period, MSFT stock has climbed as much as 1,670%, and GOOGL stock has gained 1,580%.


Mettler-Toledo tops both of these leading tech stocks with as much as a 2,973% climb.

Mettler-Toledo Delivers The Stable Earnings Top Funds Seek
----------------------------------------------------------


Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. It's also the world's biggest manufacturer and supplier of metal recognition systems for the production and packaging industry.


Geographically diversified, Mettler-Toledo derived 30% of 2020 sales from Europe, 38% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The company has a manufacturing footprint in Europe, the U.S. and China.


Mettler-Toledo, Microsoft and Alphabet did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-big-on-semiconductor-finance-machinery-transportation-sectors/). But a long track record of solid and steady earnings growth drives demand from top money managers.


Unlike the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), where the higher the score the better, for the earnings stability rating the lower the score the more stable the earnings. MSFT stock leads with an earnings stability rating of 2, followed by Mettler-Toledo (3) and Alphabet (6).


Several leading funds on the IBD Mutual Index have a position in MTD stock, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Franklin Growth (FKGRX). Fidelity Contrafund also owns shares in both Microsoft and Alphabet.


Mettler-Toledo has posted earnings acceleration in three of the last four quarters, including a 64% spike in the first quarter. For Q2, analysts expect a 44% increase, leading to a 24% EPS gain for the year.


Revenue has accelerated over the last three quarters, coming in at 24% in Q1.


MTD Stock, MSFT Stock Weigh New Buy Points
------------------------------------------


While GOOGL stock is already extended from its most recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/), Mettler-Toledo and MSFT stock are both building new [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


Mettler-Toledo is working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 1,139.48 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock has encountered resistance in recent days. It pulled back to test support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), but came off its lows to close right at that line.


MSFT stock is showing similar action as it builds a flat base showing a 263.29 entry. Microsoft slipped below its 50-day line earlier in the week, but managed to recapture that benchmark Friday.

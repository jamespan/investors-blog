 Among the stocks on IBD's [IPO Leaders screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) that had their initial public offerings in 2017, big-box retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) has the highest Composite Rating at 94. The year's most hyped IPO, Snapchat parent **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), doesn't even make the list and scores a lowly 19.
Mirroring the same path **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) initially took when it went public, [Snap has been on a downward trajectory](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-moves-closer-to-falling-below-ipo-price/). But Georgia-based Floor & Decor, which has over 70 stores in 17 states, has gotten off to a much better start, and has just broken out of a new base.


Friday's news that **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was buying **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)) further spooked the retail industry, including grocery store chains like **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), but Floor & Decor is among the [retailers who have shown strength in the age of Amazon](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/new-flooring-retailer-manages-to-sidestep-the-amazon-squeeze/).


2017 IPOs
---------


One key factor that separates Floor & Decor from several other new issues is earnings. [Many of this year's IPOs are not yet profitable](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/are-too-many-money-losing-ipo-stocks-a-sign-of-a-market-peak/), including **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **MuleSoft** ([MULE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MULE)), **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) and Snap.


By contrast, Floor & Decor's three-year average annual EPS growth stands at 67%, including average earnings gains of 96% over the last three reports. Analysts expect Q2 earnings growth to spike to 260%.


Revenue growth has also been impressive, with a 31% rise in Q1, and a three-year average annual growth rate of 35%.


Floor & Decor's track record has earned it a spot on the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) and the No. 1 rank within its industry group, ahead of **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) (No. 3) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) (No. 6).


Designing New Base
------------------


After a sharp rise from its April 27 debut, Floor & Decor has been forming a new base with a 43.20 entry. It's flashed several wide daily price swings, but the weekly chart helps keeps that volatility in perspective.



Floor & Decor is relatively liquid, trading an average daily dollar volume of around $24 million.


The stock has been testing support at its 10-day line as it tries to complete the base. When this story was originally published on Jun. 15, Floor & Decor was was still trading below the entry.


On Monday, the stock broke out in strong volume in the morning, rising over 9% during the session. But Floor & Decor gave back a chunk of those gains to close just below the entry at  43.14.


The stock was up nearly 7% for the day and was up about 1% in after-hours trading.  As you like to see on a breakout attempt, the relative strength line bolted into new high ground.


See if Floor & Decor can bounce back into the 43.20 to 45.36 buy range in strong volume Tuesday. And remember that IPO stocks can be volatile, so always have – and stick to – sound offensive and defensive [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/).

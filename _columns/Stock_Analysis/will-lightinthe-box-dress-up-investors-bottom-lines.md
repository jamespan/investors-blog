Today we're going to look at a recent IPO that has an interesting business model.

  

It's **LightInTheBox** ([LITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITB)), a China-based online retailer that was featured in the July 10 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/070913-663003-lightinthebox-sources-products-close-to-home.htm). The firm sells clothing, household good and other items items on websites like lightinthebox.com and miniinthebox.com.

  

Its websites are available in 17 languages and cover over 80% of Internet users worldwide. In fact, a little more than half of its sales came from Europe last year, while North America accounted for 24%.

  

It works closely with manufacturers to improve their production processes and time it takes to get to market.

  

Analysts say that streamlined production is one of its main strengths because it saves on manufacturing costs and it still offers premium prices in Europe and North America.

  

For example it can customize a wedding dress and sell it for $200 instead of thousands of dollars, which is what companies in the U.S. might charge.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• The company was founded in 2008 and had a string of losses until last quarter.

  

• Sales growth, however, has been strong, coming in at 99% last quarter.

  

• Going forward, analysts predict the company will earn 35 cents a share this year, compared to a 9 cent-a-share loss last year. And they see earnings rising 94% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

Still, those past losses weigh on the company's Composite Rating, which is ranked No. 9 in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-lightinthebox-hldg-ads-litb.aspx) among the 25 stocks in its industry group.

  

**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) is the group's top-rated stock. But it's been consolidating since May.

  

The industry group itself is ranked No. 11 among IBD's 197 groups, so it's been one the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock came public in early June and it's been somewhat volatile as you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page.

  

The best time to buy an IPO is after it's settled down and formed a base pattern. So we'll have to watch to see if that's the case with LightInTheBox.

  

So for now this may just be one to keep on our watch list to see how it behaves going forward.

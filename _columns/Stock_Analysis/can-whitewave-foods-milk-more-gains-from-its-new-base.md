**WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) makes plant-based beverages and dairy products under brand names like Horizon, Silk, Land O'Lakes and Earthbound Farms.

  

It's been a pioneer in the ongoing consumer shift away from conventional dairy to plant-based alternatives, with strong sales of its Silk brand almond milk driving that growth.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of revenue gains in the low single digits, sales growth jumped to 36% in both Q1 and Q2. Earnings growth also picked up to 38% in the past two reports.

  

WhiteWave is scheduled to release third-quarter numbers on Nov. 10.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 34%, followed by a 19% gain in 2015.

  

At 15%, return on equity is slightly below the 17% minimum you prefer, but overall the stock earns a solid 97 Composite Rating.

  

While WhiteWave's C- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates a roughly equal amount of institutional buying and selling over the past 13 weeks, its 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership in recent quarters point to demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

WhiteWave struggled after going public in October 2012, but has more than doubled in price since its first week on the market.

  

When we last featured the stock in the IBD Stock Analysis on Aug. 8, it was just trying to break out of a flat base. It ended up rising a little over 14% before pulling back in September to form its current double bottom pattern.

  

WhiteWave fell below its 10-week line on above-average volume earlier this month, but regained that benchmark two weeks later.

  

After failing to close above its 37.25 buy point on Wednesday, the stock tried again on Friday but closed just below the entry.

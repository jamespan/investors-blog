What do **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) have in common? They all use cloud-based human resources and payroll solutions from **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)).









 
 
 Workday's impressive list of clients doesn't stop there, with **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)), **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) and even Rolls-Royce also using the HR and procurement software it provides for a wide range of industries, including communications, health care, retail, government and financial services.
According to Workday's website, Amazon says Workday "will support Amazon as we continue to hire employees around the world." Netflix says that, since switching to Workday, "we now have HR, payroll and financials in one application."


While correlation certainly doesn't equal causation, it's interesting to note that while Workday is setting up a potential breakout move, Amazon and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are also basing and Netflix, BofA and Sanofi have recently broken out. Netflix and BofA closed Tuesday's session still within buy range, while Sanofi fell back below its entry but found support at the 10-day moving average.


On Tuesday, Workday began its analyst event called Workday Rising with several announcements, including the general availability of Workday Data-as-a-Service (DaaS). The first DaaS offering will be Workday Benchmarking, which allows companies to compare their performance to that of their peers.


700% Earnings Growth — With This Caveat
---------------------------------------


In fiscal 2018 Q2 (ended July 31), Workday posted a 700% spike in earnings, but that was based on a comparison to a year-over-year quarter with no earnings. Analysts are looking for fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share to soar 592%.


Sales growth increased to 41%, marking four straight quarters of rising revenue gains. The company has a three-year annual top line growth rate of 42%.


On the downside, Workday has a subpar return on equity (2.3%) and annual pretax profit margin (1.6%).


But institutional investors have shown demand for shares, as indicated by a 1.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


Workday's 93 Composite Rating earns it the No. 9 slot within the No. 33-ranked enterprise software group. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) hold the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively.


Procuring A Breakout?
---------------------


While Workday's new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) is technically a third-stage pattern, it doesn't have the true "feel" of a later-stage base, which typically forms after a stock has had a more pronounced run-up.


In Workday's case, the stock has made a more gradual climb. Since its 2012 IPO, Workday has gone through long stretches of essentially sideways action.


Time will tell if the stock can push sharply past the 111.55 buy point and launch a sharper upward climb.



The relative strength line is within striking distance of new high ground, and in a sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day line has climbed back above the longer-term 50-day line.


On Wednesday and Thursday, the stock found support at its 10-day moving average. On Friday, Workday edged higher to close the week just 2% below the buy point.


Amazon has been rising and is now 8% below a potential buy point. Netflix is still within buy range after breaking out in strong volume Oct. 5 and adding to those gains on Friday. [BofA beat Q3 earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-of-america-tops-q3-earnings-views-wells-fargo-on-tap/) late Thursday and managed to bounce back into the buy zone and positive territory after slipping earlier in Friday's session.


See if Workday can hold its ground and punch through the buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

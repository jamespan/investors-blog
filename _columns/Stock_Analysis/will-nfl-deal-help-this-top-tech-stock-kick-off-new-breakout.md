Did you know that the same company whose technology is inside shipping labels from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) also tracks the movement of NFL players during the game? Now **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)) hopes to kick off a breakout move as it starts to also track the actual football in real time.









 
 
 This season marks Zebra's fourth year as the NFL's official on-field player-tracking provider, working with Wilson Sporting Goods to monitor the players' movements by adding RFID tags to their equipment.
Starting this year, [Zebra and Wilson are also monitoring the football](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/about-zebra/newsroom/press-releases/2017/zebra-technologies-nfl-wilson-sporting-goods-ball-tracking.html) to collect location, speed and rotation data throughout the game, including during Thursday Night Football, which is now streamed live on Amazon Prime.


Getting 'Phygital'
------------------


Through its RFID tags, bar code scanners, mobile computers, tablets, printers and related software, Zebra Technologies gives businesses in the health care, manufacturing, retail and other industries better visibility into the massive amounts of data being generated by today's increasingly complex and connected world.


In addition to working with Amazon, Zebra is helping brick-and-mortar retailers get "phygital" by using Internet of Things technology to enhance the in-store customer experience.


Retailers are using the technology for a wide range of applications, including tracking customers' footpaths, beaming related coupons to their mobile devices and tracking inventory in real time.


On Tuesday, Zebra announced Savanna, which the company calls "a fundamental building-block platform for accelerating Enterprise Asset Intelligence and the digital transformation of enterprise operations." Savanna uses IoT connectivity to identify actionable data and allow organization to build applications that transform workflows and improve business performance.


Institutional Demand
--------------------


Earnings have risen 29% in each of the last two quarters, while sales growth has been more tepid, with a gain of 2% in both reports.


Analysts expect a 36% rise in earnings when the Illinois-based company reports Q3 numbers in mid-November. Estimates were recently revised higher.


Demand for Zebra's stock is reflected in its A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), 1.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership.


The stock's 92 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 ranking within the Electronics-Miscellaneous Products group, just behind **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)).


Heading Into Buy Zone?
----------------------


Zebra's share price has more than doubled since finding a bottom in July 2016, and the stock is now forming a second-stage consolidation with a 109.40 entry.


On Aug. 8, the stock jumped nearly 10% on its [Q2 earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zebra-technologies-beats-second-quarter-targets-guides-higher/), pushing it back above the 50-day moving average. In another sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day moving average climbed back above its longer-term cousin a few days later.


As the indexes and big-name stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) sold off Monday, Zebra Technologies also pulled back, but managed to find support at its 10-day line.



On Tuesday, Zebra fell 0.5% and closed below its 10-day line. Facebook, Apple and Tesla managed to stay in positive territory, but the jury is still out on whether tech stocks will rebound from Monday's fall. Amazon closed fractionally lower in below-average volume.


In early trade Wednesday, Zebra Technologies was up nearly 1% and back above its 10-day line, while Amazon, Facebook, Tesla and Apple were also moving higher.


See if the indexes and leading stocks bounce back, and see if Zebra can punch through the buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

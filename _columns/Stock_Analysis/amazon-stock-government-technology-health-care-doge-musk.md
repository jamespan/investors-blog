President Donald Trump and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) Chief Executive Elon Musk continue to make waves with their focus on the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Now **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) looks to speed up the digital transformation of U.S. federal agencies while [shaking up the health care industry](https://www.investors.com/news/amazon-amzn-stock-teladoc-tdoc-health-care-offerings-partnership/). And these initiatives have [helped Amazon stock launch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-buy-2024-amzn/) a breakout into buy range.




Amazon Helps Streamline Government Agencies
-------------------------------------------


The retail and cloud computing juggernaut has already staked a beachhead in the health care industry with initiatives like [Amazon Health](https://health.amazon.com/). It also teamed up with **GE HealthCare** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)) and **Teledoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) to expand its footprint in this space.


Amazon has also just expanded its collaboration with **Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)) to expedite the [digital transformation of U.S. government agencies](https://press.aboutamazon.com/aws/2025/1/aws-and-booz-allen-announce-expanded-partnership-to-speed-digital-transformation-for-u-s-federal-agencies). The partnership aims to accelerate and improve technology outcomes and efficiencies across government.


Amazon and the giant consulting firm plan to integrate their extensive experience in artificial intelligence and other technologies to help federal agencies drive innovation, speed decision making and reduce costs. The focus is on helping government more efficiently fulfill its intelligence, defense, civil, and commercial missions.

Earnings On Tap
---------------


Amazon is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 6. For the quarter, analysts forecast revenue growth of 10% to $187.4 billion and earnings growth of 48% to $1.48 a share.


For 2024, Wall Street expects earnings to jump 78% to $5.15 a share. Meanwhile, forecasts for 2025 call for 22% earnings growth to $6.25 a share.


As one of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/), Amazon ties Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) in terms of market capitalization weighting on the Nasdaq. Both megacaps make up 6.4% each of the tech-heavy index.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) earn the top three spots, with Amazon stock coming in fourth. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) at 4.5% and Tesla with 3.3% round out the group.


Amazon Stock In Buy Range
-------------------------


Building on its sharp ascent since bottoming out in January 2023, Amazon cleared a 233 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) earlier this month. Since the stock [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/) last summer, Amazon's latest move is from a still-early, first-stage base. Such formations are more likely to drive big gains than late-stage patterns, like [Nvidia's most recent setup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks-nvidia-nvda-stock/).


Up over 1% Friday, Amazon closed the week in [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/), which extends up to 255.65. It earns the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-amzn.aspx).


Signs of demand for Amazon include an A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.2 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Plus, a whopping 457 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in the stock.

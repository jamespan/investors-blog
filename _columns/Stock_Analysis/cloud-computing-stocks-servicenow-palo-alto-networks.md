What do **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)) and Yale University have in common? They all use cloud-based enterprise software from IBD 50 stock **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).




Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Silicon Valley, ServiceNow is among the best software stocks to buy and watch. It's one of six enterprise software stocks with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)), **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) also earn that distinction.


With that lineup of top-rated stocks, it's not surprising that the enterprise software industry group ranks No. 7 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.

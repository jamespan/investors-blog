Epam Systems is a software engineering and IT services firm that competes with outsourcing companies in China and India.

  

While it's headquartered in Pennsylvania, the bulk of its workforce is in Central and Eastern Europe.

  

As noted in IBD's [IPO Analysis](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htmcolumn) on Oct. 9, **Epam** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) has been pursuing a growth-through-acquisition strategy, including its June purchase of GGA Software Services, which helped expand its health care and life sciences services.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The strategy appears to be working. Epam has delivered eight quarters of steady revenue gains, ranging from 26% to 32%.

  

Earnings growth has also picked up over the last three quarters, coming in between 30% and 34%.

  

The company is scheduled to report Q3 numbers on Nov. 3.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 25%, followed by a 15% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Overall, Epam earns a 99 Composite Rating and an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Epam stock sold off sharply in March in response to Russia-Ukraine tensions. Investors got spooked because the bulk of Epam's workforce is in that region.

  

But the stock recovered and by May was closing in on a new buy point. However, it failed to break out and ended up forming a handle, which eventually turned into a new base.

  

Epam has now formed a cup-with-handle, which is still considered a first-stage pattern.

  

The stock broke past the 44.46 buy point Thursday on volume about double its average. The buying range is up to 46.68, or 5% above the buy point. As of Friday's close, Epam was still trading near the buy point.

It's 2017, and somewhere Blockbuster is grinning. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), the once-upstart DVD delivery service and streaming pioneer that upended the video rental behemoth, is facing increasingly heated competition from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **CBS** ([CBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBS)) and Hulu. Just to name a few.


But with its success in developing original content, such as "Stranger Things" and "Orange Is The New Black," and a massive international expansion last year, will Netflix have the last laugh?


Netflix Vs. Amazon Prime Vs. Hulu
---------------------------------


Netflix, which bills itself as "the world's leading internet television network," entered over 130 new countries in 2016 and now has more than 86 million members in over 190 nations.


The company has yet to crack the great wide screens of China due to what Netflix calls a "challenging" regulatory environment for foreign digital content services.


Not to be outdone, Amazon launched its own aggressive global expansion last year, with Amazon Prime Video now available in more than 200 countries, also not including China.


While Netflix charges $7.99 to $11.99 per month for unlimited streaming (depending on the number of devices used simultaneously), Amazon Prime members get the retail giant's TV and movie steaming service,free shipping, free music streaming and free e-books, all for $99 a year.


Hulu, which is jointly owned by media powerhouses **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Twenty-First Century Fox** ([FOXA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOXA)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **Time Warner** ([TWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWX)), has nearly 12 million members and just [inked a deal with CBS for a new live-TV service](https://www.investors.com/news/cbs-hulu-said-to-be-closing-in-on-live-streaming-deal/).


Streaming Profits Again
-----------------------


After a string of quarters with negative earnings growth, Netflix posted a 50% gain in Q2 and 71% rise in Q3. Sales growth has been more consistently strong, ranging from 23% to 32% over the last eight quarters.


The California-based company is set to report Q4 numbers after the close on Jan. 18.


For 2016, analysts expect EPS to rise 32%, then spike to 134% this year.


Signs of institutional demand are mixed. Netflix sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, but the number of funds that own shares has generally drifted lower in recent quarters and its 0.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio is below the 1 or higher benchmark you look for.


Testing New Breakout
--------------------


After reporting Q3 earnings on Oct. 17, Netflix soared over 25% for the week in volume 158% above average.



It soon pulled back to add a handle to its first-stage chart pattern creating a 129.39 buy point.


Netflix kicked off the New Year with two up days in above-average volume. It broke out Wednesday, but closed mere pennies above the entry and volume was just 13% above average, well below the 40% or higher spike you prefer to see.


On Thursday, the stock added to those gains, rising just under 2% in volume 33% higher than normal. Netflix ended the day within the 129.39 to 135.86 buy zone.


See if Netflix can continue to climb in strong volume and keep its mojo rising with the upcoming Q4 earnings report.

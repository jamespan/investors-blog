Today we'll look at **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), which develops pharmaceuticals for specialized areas in ophthalmology, antidotes and controlled substances for pain management and anesthesia.

  

Earlier this month, Akorn announced it was buying VersaPharm, a prescription pharmaceuticals firm that focuses on dermatology, tuberculosis and hemophilia.

  

Akorn paid $440 million in cash for VersaPharm, and expects it to add around $100 million in annual revenues and $0.10 to $0.12 in earnings per share.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

That could add a nice boost to Akorn's top and bottom lines, which have already been improving in recent quarters.

  

Earnings growth rebounded from single digits to 23% in Q1, and sales growth also accelerated to 23%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 56%, followed by a 43% gain in 2015.

  

Akorn sports a solid 27% return on equity.

  

And institutional investors have taken note. The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a solid B+.

  

Also, the number of funds that own shares has been rising in recent quarters.

  

Four typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: Wasatch Micro Cap (WMICX), Turner Emerging Growth Investor (TMCGX), Scout Small Cap (UMBHX) and Columbia Acorn Z (ACRNX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Like many leading stocks right now, Akorn is currently forming a base. But unlike several other leaders, it is not a later-stage pattern.

  

As you can see in the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, the low in the current potential cup-shaped base undercut the low in the prior pattern. That resets the base count, making this a first-stage pattern.

  

That's positive, since first- and second-stage bases generally have a higher rate of success.

  

After a short-lived breakout from its prior pattern, Akorn sold off sharply, including a big gap down on March 3. That came when the company lowered guidance for 2014 and announced a new accounting problem.

  

Although the stock managed to rebound a bit and close above its 50-day line, it was still down over 6% for the day, and as you can see volume was huge â€” 475% higher than normal.

  

The stock managed to find support right at the 200-day line, and got back above the 50-day within a couple of weeks.

  

It's continued to climb higher, and has been holding its 10-day moving average, which is the green line on the chart.

  

While there have been a few up days on heavy volume in the right side of the base, see if even more start to occur.

  

Heavy trading on the upside would indicate fund managers and other big investors are scooping up shares, and that's what needed to propel the stock higher.

  

If the current consolidation ends up being a cup-shaped base, the ideal buy point would be 28.10, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

But also keep an eye on the overall market. It's best to wait for a new uptrend to begin before making any new buys.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-akorn-inc-akrx.aspx) shows Akorn carries the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating among the 42 stocks in its Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 3 among IBD's 197 industries.

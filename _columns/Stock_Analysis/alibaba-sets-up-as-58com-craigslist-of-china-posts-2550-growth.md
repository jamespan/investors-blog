As top-ranked Chinese stocks like **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) break out of new bases or rebound from recent pullbacks, **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) – the so-called Craigslist of China – may be set to launch a new run of its own.









 
 
 58.com went public in 2013, followed a month later by Autohome. Alibaba and Weibo had their IPOs in 2014.
With the highest possible 99 Composite Rating, Alibaba and 58.com are tied for the No. 1 spot within the Internet-Content industry group. Fellow [top Chinese stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) holds the No. 2 ranking with a 98 rating.


58.com, which is an [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), and Baozun both made the list of [top-rated stocks expecting 50%-plus EPS growth in Q4](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/q4-earnings-preview-which-stocks-expect-50-or-greater-growth/).


Explosive EPS Growth – With A Caveat
------------------------------------


58.com has posted three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, including a 2,550% spike in its latest report. But the gains for Q1 and Q3 last year were based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed a loss.


Third-quarter revenue rose 34% to $410 million. The company has been growing revenue at an average annual pace of 89% over the last three years.


58.com's much larger peer Alibaba generated over $7.5 billion in revenue in Q3 and has a three-year annual sales growth rate of 39%, impressive for a company of its size. Its three-year average annual EPS growth rate stands at 26%.


Alibaba is expected to report Q4 earnings on Jan. 22, followed by 58.com in late February.


Later-Stage Base
----------------


Like Alibaba, 58.com has been working on a third-stage cup-shaped base with a potential buy point of 79.89. On Friday, 58.com briefly cleared that price, but closed the week just below it. Heading into Monday's close, the stock was up nearly 5%, putting it back above the buy point. Volume was trending well above average.


Signs of institutional demand include a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.7 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership.


Alibaba is forming a somewhat similar consolidation with a 191.85 entry. With a more than 2% gain Friday, the internet giant closed the week just below the buy point and is now trying to edge closer to the breakout price.

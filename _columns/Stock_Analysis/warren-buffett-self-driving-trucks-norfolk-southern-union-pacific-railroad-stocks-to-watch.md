**Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) CEO Warren Buffett may be pleased with his 2009 purchase of BNSF Railway, but the rival railroads he sold at the time – **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) and **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) – are both testing new buy zones.
At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting last month, the "Oracle of Omaha" said self-driving trucks would eventually have an impact on train transportation. But for now railroad stocks are chugging right along, boosted by this year's rise in coal production.


According to the Association of American Railroads, in terms of rail revenue and tonnage, "no single commodity is more important to America's railroads than coal."


Profit Train Returns
--------------------


After several quarters of negative sales growth, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific have both posted improving top and bottom lines in recent reports. Norfolk Southern's earnings per share have grown from -1% to 15% over the last three quarters, while Union Pacific has shown a rise from -9% to 14%. In Q1, both companies finally moved into positive territory.


Fund managers have taken note, with Norfolk Southern now sporting an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.8 up/down volume ratio and seven quarters of rising fund ownership. By comparison, Union Pacific has a B Acc/Dist Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and five quarters of increasing fund ownership.


Norfolk Southern ranks No. 3 among railroad stocks, while Union Pacific comes in at No. 4. **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and **Canadian National Railway** ([CNI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNI)) hold the No. 1 and No. 2 rankings, respectively.


Breakouts Ahead?
----------------


Norfolk Southern has been outpacing Union Pacific in terms of technical action, with an 84 Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating vs. its rival's 69. The relative strength line for Norfolk Southern also indicates stronger price action.



Norfolk Southern temporarily cleared a 125.10 buy point Friday, but pulled back to end the day below it. But the stock closed the week in positive ground with a 1%-plus gain. Norfolk Southern is still within 1% of the entry. Union Pacific followed similar action, and closed the week just below the 111.48 entry.

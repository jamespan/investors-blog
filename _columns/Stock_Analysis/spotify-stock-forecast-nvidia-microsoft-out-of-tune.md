With the Nasdaq trapped below its 50-day moving average and Magnificent Seven stocks like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) out of tune with Wall Street, a fresh breakout by **Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) is music to investors' ears.


Plus, forecasts of 308% earnings growth for this year hit the right beat as Spotify stock makes that latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/microsoft-nvidia-shunned-meet-the-new-big-daddy-on-wall-street/). In the report for August, Spotify showed strong demand among these savvy investors. They scooped up an estimated $344 million worth of Spotify stock.


Meanwhile, neither [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-msft-stock-buy-now/) nor any of the other [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) names made the cut.




Turning Up The Volume On Impressive Growth
------------------------------------------


The music streaming service continues to hit the right notes. In three out of the last four quarters, Spotify has posted triple-digit earnings growth. While each of the three is based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss, the rebound from earlier quarters is impressive.


In the second quarter, [Spotify beat subscriber and profit targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-q2-2024-earnings/).


Third-quarter estimates call for a whopping 430% spike to $1.92 earnings per share. For the full year, analysts forecast a 308% gain to $6.26 a share.


On the sales front, Spotify has delivered solid double-digit gains in each of the last seven quarters. In its Q2 report on July 26, the company generated nearly $4.1 billion in revenue, an 18% year-over-year gain.


Reflecting the demand that put Spotify on the latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds, the music streamer has six straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 37 funds with an A+ rating from IBD owns shares of the stock.

Spotify Stock In Buy Range In Sour Market
-----------------------------------------


While Nvidia, Microsoft and others are trying to find their footing after a rash of selling, IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) has fallen to the lowest-possible 0%-20%. That may change as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 flash signs of a potential market turnaround. But this environment clearly puts investor emphasis on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/).


That said, Spotify stock has shown strength and resilience within this volatile market.


After a severe slump that began in 2021, the stock found a bottom in November 2022. A powerful rebound has lifted Spotify within striking distance of an all-time high.


Last month, shares of Spotify cleared a 331.08 buy point in a late-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). After briefly notching a 52-week high on Aug. 1, Spotify reversed lower in heavy volume as the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled alongside Nvidia and Microsoft.


Spotify also retreated, but — unlike Nvidia and other major stocks — it soon found support at its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and returned to a buy range. Last week, Spotify found its rhythm, bouncing back into buy range with a strong upside reversal. The stock edged slightly higher again on Monday.


Showing market leadership in this volatile environment, the relative strength line has just spiked to a 52-week high.


While current market conditions and lingering weakness in tech titans like Nvidia and Microsoft call for caution, solid institutional demand, positive chart action and sweet-sounding growth estimates bode well for Spotify stock.


Nvidia is also showing resilience as it continues to come off its Aug. 6 lows, rising nearly 4% to kick off the new week.

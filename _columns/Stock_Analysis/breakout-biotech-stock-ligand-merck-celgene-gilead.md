What do **Novartis** ([NVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVS)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Baxter International** ([BAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAX)) and **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) have in common? They all have licensing or other business relationships with **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)).




Ligand, which was recently [added to the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/todays-best-growth-stocks-include-a-couple-of-pharmaceuticals-ligand-and-supernus/), is a leading biotech stock that develops and acquires technologies that help top pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines.


The San Diego-based company develops treatments in the areas of oncology, inflammation, blood disorders and the central nervous system.


Fast-Growing Biotech Stock
--------------------------


Ligand Pharmaceuticals' business model has proved to be a profitable one. The company has generated average EPS growth of 102% over the last three quarters, including a 172% spike in Q1. Revenue gains have ranged from 32% to 92% over the last four reports.


Boosted by a stellar 80% annual pretax profit margin and a solid 19.6% return on equity, Ligand earns a 98 Composite Rating, tying it with **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)) for the No. 1 ranking among the leading [biomedical and biotech companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/). The industry ranks No. 27 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Supernus Pharmaceuticals has also earned a spot on the IBD 50, as well as the [Sector Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3299381).


Biotech Breakout
----------------


While share prices for Celgene, Amgen, Pfizer and Gilead Sciences have lagged in recent months, Ligand Pharmaceuticals' stock has continued to climb.


Ligand cleared a 172.17 entry in a second-stage double bottom last week. On Tuesday, the stock climbed out of buy range from that entry, but the stock has also been showing another buy point at 184.89. Ligand broke past that entry on Tuesday with a 2.3% gain to 185.37 as its relative strength line continued to climb into new-high territory.


The stock is adding to those gains on Wednesday morning as it rises nearly 1% to 187.13. The buy zone extends to 194.13.


Ligand's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has now risen to an A-, and four quarters of rising fund ownership is further proof of institutional demand for the stock.


Supernus has managed to keep adding to its gains after soaring 14% in heavy volume Friday following its latest earnings report. On Tuesday, the developer of epilepsy treatments rose another 1.7% to 58.10. The stock is off slightly on Wednesday.


Fellow biotech stock **Enanta Pharmaceuticals** ([ENTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTA)) has bounced back from a sharp, but brief post-earnings sell-off on May 9. Both Supernus and Enanta are now out of buy range.

With [Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies](https://www.investors.com/news/blockchain-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-news-trends/) disrupting and becoming increasingly embedded in financial markets, the crypto craze is impacting companies like **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and even **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Now investment banking and institutional brokerage leader **Cowen** ([COWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COWN)) is expanding its role in the digital assets space.




On May 13, [Cowen and PolySign](https://www.cowen.com/news/cowen-and-polysign-to-launch-strategic-partnership-geared-toward-providing-clients-access-to-cryptocurrency-and-digital-assets/) announced a strategic partnership to let Cowen's institutional clients securely leverage cryptocurrencies and digital assets in their portfolios. Through Cowen Digital Asset Investment Company, a division of Cowen, the company invested $25 million in PolySign. Led by Cowen, the investment was part of the $53 million initial closing of PolySign's Series B financing. Also investing in the round were Blockchain.com, Race Capital, Sandia Holdings and PilotRock Investments.


The funds will be used to accelerate PolySign's ongoing development of institutional blockchain applications.


While Cowen expands its cryptocurrency and blockchain presence among institutional investors, [PayPal](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/) and [Square](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/) push the consumer side. Owned by PayPal, Venmo now accepts Bitcoin, Litecoin and Etherium. Through [Cash App](https://cash.app/press) and other initiatives, Square is also betting big on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Last October, [Square invested $50 million in Bitcoin](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment).


IBD 50 Stock Cowen Finances 1,064% EPS Growth
---------------------------------------------


Albeit based on the prior-year quarter that showed a loss, Cowen posted 1,064% earnings growth on April 29. The New York-based company delivered stellar triple-digit or better EPS growth in the previous three quarters.


Cowen has also generated four quarters of accelerating sales growth, including a 283% sales increase in Q1.


But analysts expect earnings to decline 68% in Q2, leading to a 14% slowdown for the year.


Yet, Cowen earns a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), along with fellow [financial sector stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansachs/) **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **B. Riley Financial** ([RILY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RILY)) and [leading Chinese stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy/) **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)).


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Cowen stock is among the top financial stocks in the investment banking and brokerages industry group, which ranks a solid 34 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Will Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies Lift Cowen To New Breakout?
----------------------------------------------------------


Cowen stock has rocketed off its March 2020 pandemic-driven lows. Along the way, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) soared and the stock found solid support along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


After climbing to just below a 43.27 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its current [second-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), Cowen has pulled back to test support at its 10-week line. Its RS line has also slipped off its prior highs.


Early Friday, Cowen is holding support and up well nearly 2%.


See if trends in blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and digital assets can rejuvenate analysts' outlook for Cowen and give the financial stock the boost it needs to break out.

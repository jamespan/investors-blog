Insulation and building products may not be as sexy as the latest tech gadgets. But as **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) shows, growing earnings at an average annual clip of 42% over the last three years grabs the attention of top money managers.




TopBuild, which installs and distributes insulation and building products throughout the U.S., made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutuall-funds-invest-big-in-aapl-amzn-fb-nflx-googl-msft-adbe-zm-docu/). Plus, 88 leading funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD have reported a position the stock.


In a further sign of solid institutional demand, TopBuild sports a 1.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/) and B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/).


As the Florida-based company gets ready to report earnings on Aug. 4 before the stock market opens, TopBuild is trying to nail down a new 134.85 buy point. A breakout would mark a new all-time high for TopBuild stock.


TopBuild 'Only Marginally Impacted' By Coronavirus
--------------------------------------------------


Few industries remained unscathed by the coronavirus stock market crash in the first half of 2020. TopBuild fared relatively well, with CEO Jerry Volas saying that in [Q1](https://www.topbuild.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/89/topbuild-reports-first-quarter-2020-results), TopBuild was "only marginally impacted by COVID-19." The company managed to generate a 29% EPS increase and a 5% gain in revenue for the first quarter.


When TopBuild reports next month, analysts expect a 20% slowdown in Q1 earnings and an 8% decline for the full year. But estimates for the second quarter have recently been revised higher and market watchers see a return to 23% EPS growth in 2021.


Building on its history of using its "national footprint to gain economies of scale while capitalizing on our local market," in February [TopBuild bought Cooper Glass](https://www.topbuild.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/82/topbuild-acquires-cooper-glass), which serves the Memphis, Tenn., area.


Will TopBuild Stock Install New Buy Zone?
-----------------------------------------


TopBuild is trading around 8% below the buy point, as the stock and general market encounter some selling pressure. But the stock has found support as it climbs right along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


The stock jumped nearly 5% June 29 as it got ready to join the [S&P MidCap 400](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/topbuild-set-join-p-midcap-215500836.html). TopBuild traded 7.4 million shares that day, a 1,257% increase over its daily average.


See if TopBuild can hit a new all-time high and punch though the 134.85 buy point in heavy trade. But keep an eye on the overall market and remember that it can be risky to buy any stock just before it reports earnings.

Today, we're going to talk about **Range Resources** ([RRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RRC)), an oil and gas company, working the Marcellus Shale region.

  

The Marcellus is located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and West Virginia and is the largest natural gas field in the U.S.

  

In fact, as a July 22 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/071913-664449-range-resources-and-cabot-oil-play-marcellus.htm) pointed out, two years ago Range sold all its holdings in the Barnett Shale in Texas and invested that money in the Marcellus region.

  

It's now one of the largest producers in the Marcellus, accounting for 10% of the basin's production.

  

It uses hydraulic fracturing techniques to crack the hard shale rock and extract the gas. And it's found great commercial value there.

  

Range's CEO says the firm's wells in southwestern Pennsylvania produce three times as much as those in the best spots in the Barnett region.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth slowed last year, but has been rebounding, coming in at 120% last quarter.

  

• Sales were up 27% last quarter.

  

• Going forward, analysts see earnings climbing 61% this year and 47% next year.

  

• Still, Range's debt-to-equity ratio is 122%, so it does have some debt. There's no magic number to look for with that ratio, but as a rule of thumb the lower the debt, the better.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-range-resources-corp-rrc.aspx) shows that Range's Composite Rating is only 63, so you'd like to see that improve. **EPL Oil & Gas** ([EPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPL)) and **Bonanza Creek Energy** ([BCEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCEI)) are some other stocks in the group you may be familiar with.

  

The industry group as a whole is ranked No. 83 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Range has been carving out a flat base pattern since March.

  

To find the potential buy point in that type of pattern, just add 10 cents to the highest point in the pattern.

  

Watch to see if Range can break out past that buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average.

  

Some bases also give investors earlier opportunities to get on board and that's the case with this one. There's also an alternative, lower buy point at 81.23, where the stock has run into resistance before.

  

Range may be worth keeping an eye on to see if it can muscle its way past both those ideal buy points and launch a new price run.

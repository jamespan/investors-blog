LGI Homes Rebuilds Growth — And New Buy Point
---------------------------------------------


Based in Texas, LGI Homes builds entry-level, single-family homes in its home state and 14 others. After posting EPS growth ranging from 9% to 112% over five quarters, earnings slowed in Q1 and Q2 of 2019. On the bright side, in a sign of resilience, the decline slowed from 34% in Q1 to just 4% in Q2. Then in Q3 of last year, EPS spiked to a 27% increase.


LGI Homes expects to release Q4 and full 2019 numbers on Feb. 25 before the market opens. Earlier in January, the company announced [record-breaking quarterly home closings](http://investor.lgihomes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lgi-homes-inc-announces-record-december-fourth-quarter-and-0) for the fourth quarter. Analysts are looking for 36% earnings growth in Q4 and a gain of 10% for 2019.


In terms of annual pretax profit margins, PulteGroup's 13.6% margin just tops LGI Homes' a 13.2%. D.H. Horton (12.1%), **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) (8.1%) and M/I Homes (6.7%) round out the top five stocks within the industry group.


Breakout Building For LGI Homes
-------------------------------


LGI Homes has seen a 24% decline within its base, considered within acceptable limits. Since finding a bottom in December, the stock has been recovering while showing several up weeks in decent volume.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remains below a new 52-week high, but the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) is poised to overtake its longer-term 40-week line.


Within its current base, LGI Homes has flashed several weeks of tight trading. See if the stock can now complete its cup-shaped pattern and break out into a new all-time high.


On Friday, LGI Homes just under 2% as it built a handle in below-average volume.


D.R. Horton and PulteGroup are already extended, while M/I Homes, KB Home and NVR are testing prior entries.

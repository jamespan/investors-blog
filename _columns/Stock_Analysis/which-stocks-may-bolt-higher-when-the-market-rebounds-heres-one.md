 As **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) struggles to hold its ground and [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) try to rebound from recent pullbacks, printed circuit board leader **TTM Technologies** ([TTMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTMI)) has shown resilience in the face of recent selling pressure and is back in a buy zone.
Apple remains below its 10-week moving average, after [getting a downgrade from Mizuho](https://www.investors.com/news/apple-downgraded-as-iphone-excitement-is-already-baked-in-adobe-downgraded/). Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have found support at their 50-day moving averages, but each was down slightly on Wednesday.


[IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member TTM Technologies has shown market-leading relative strength, with its RS line still floating near new high ground — a sign of market leadership, particularly in a troubled market.


Explosive Earnings Growth
-------------------------


It doesn't hurt that TTM Technologies has posted three quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a jump from 87% to 164% in Q1.


The Costa Mesa, CA-based company has now posted average EPS gains of 104% over the last three reports.


With a name that stands for time-to-market to emphasize the company's focus on helping customers shorten the time to develop products and bring them to market, TTM is involved in a wide range of industries, from aerospace and automotive to networking and medical, just to name a few.


Institutional Demand
--------------------


Fund managers and other large investors have shown clear interest in the stock, as indicated by three straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Sixty-one A- or higher-rated mutual funds own shares.


TTM also has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


Resilience Under Pressure
-------------------------


TTM Technologies bolted past a 17.96 entry on Jun. 8 in volume 94% above average. The next day, it moved more than 5% above the entry during the session, but gave back the bulk of those gains as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off sharply.


The indexes remains under pressure, but TTM has held tough, and was still 2% above the entry at the close Wednesday.


While it's difficult for any stock to move higher when the general market runs into selling pressure, so far the action of TTM Technologies, combined with its strong earnings growth and institutional demand, could mean it's poised to pop when a strong market environment returns.


One key factor to watch is volume. Look for heavy, above-average trade on up days to kick in to show conviction for the move.

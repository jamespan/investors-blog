With earnings on tap for Wednesday, China's leading internet portal and the largest shareholder in **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)),  **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), is adding to its recent breakout.









 
 
 Weibo, the so-called Twitter of China that was spun off from Sina and went public in 2014, reports the same day and has zoomed past a 79.08 entry in a later-stage base.
Sina still owns nearly half of Weibo's shares, while Chinese e-commerce giant **Alibaba**[symb=BABA] owns nearly one-third of the microblogging leader.


The relationship between these [top Chinese internet stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) also includes a partnership in 2014 with Alibaba-owned Alipay to launch a mobile payment system called Weibo Wallet.


Explosive Earnings Growth
-------------------------


Sina has generated average EPS growth of 491% over the last three quarters, and analysts are looking for a gain of 111% when it reports Wednesday. The company's 98 EPS Rating means it's outpacing 98% of all stocks in terms of annual and quarterly earnings growth.


For the full year, analysts expect earnings per share to rise 89%, followed by a 42% gain in 2018. Analysts recently revised higher their estimates for both years.


Weibo has posted EPS gains averaging 179% over the last three quarters, and consensus analyst estimates for Q2 call for another triple-digit increase of 125%.


Sina, Weibo and each of the other top five leaders in the No. 19-ranked Internet-Content group – **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) – earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.


Breakout Attempt, Take Two
--------------------------


Sina cleared a 95.59 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) at the end of last month, but has seesawed in and out of buy range since then. Another possible entry is at 97.89.


While longer-term demand for shares is reflected in five straight quarters of rising fund ownership, going into Monday's action, volume had been lighter than you'd like to see on a breakout attempt.


But Sina opened the week with a more than 4% gain in heavy trade, putting it at the very upper end of the buy zone that extends to 100.37. Using the 97.89 entry, the stock is 3% above the buy point.


Note how Sina's Accumulation/Distribution Rating improved from a D+ to a C+ based on that action.


On Friday, Weibo briefly pushed past its 79.08, but slipped back below it by the close.


On Monday, Weibo spiked nearly 10%, pushing it beyond buy range. Volume was 171% higher than normal.


Keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just ahead of earnings, so see how Sina and Weibo report and how the market reacts. Alibaba is set to report on Aug. 17.

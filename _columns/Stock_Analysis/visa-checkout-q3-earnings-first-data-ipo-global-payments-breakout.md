As **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) promotes Visa Checkout as the easy way to pay online, its stock may be starting to mobilize a new breakout. Along with **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)), **Blackhawk Network** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)) and **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)), Visa is a member of the Finance - Credit Card/Payment Processing industry group, which currently ranks No. 38 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

The group will get a new member when **First Data**, set to trade under the ticker FDC, has what is expected to be the [largest IPO of 2015](http://news.investors.com/technology/101215-775169-ipo-calendar-initial-public-offerings-this-week.htm) on Thursday.

  

Last week, Global Payments blew past a cup-with-handle buy point on blowout Q3 earnings and a rise in full-year guidance.

  

Visa's stock may also charge ahead when the company reports third-quarter numbers on Oct. 27.

  

The credit card giant has already earned a spot on IBD Leaderboard's ["Leaders Near a Buy Point"](http://leaderboard.investors.com/products/default.aspx?id=trial2013&src=ABLBCDR) list.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Visa's coming off a strong second-quarter report that saw revenue growth rise from 8% to 12%, while earnings gains more than doubled from 15% to 37%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 21%, followed by a 14% gain in 2016.

  

The San Francisco-based firm has a solid 20% return on equity and 97 Composite Rating.

  

But its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D indicates moderate selling by large investors over the last 13 weeks. See if that improves to at least a C by the time of a possible breakout.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Visa broke out of a flat base in late July, just before it reported Q2 earnings. It then pulled back to form a new base as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 also corrected.

  

During the Aug. 24 flash crash, Visa fell sharply but rebounded to close the week at the top of its price range.

  

The 10-week line then acted like a ceiling of resistance, but note how tight the weekly closes were and how the stock found support at the 40-week line.

  

Visa recaptured the 10-week moving average last week and added to those gains on Monday.

  

While building the right side of the base, Visa closed higher for 9 out of 10 days, as the Relative Strength line moved into new high ground.

  

But volume has been lacking.

  

You'd prefer to see volume on up days rise and come in above average in the lead-up to a potential breakout, but trading has been generally lightening up.

  

So look for heavier volume to kick in as Visa tries to complete its base and break past the 77.02 buy point.

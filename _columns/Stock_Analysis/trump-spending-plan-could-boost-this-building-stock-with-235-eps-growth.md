 Building oil and gas pipelines and electric power plants may not sound sexy, but it's been highly profitable for heavy-construction firm **MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)) in recent quarters.
The company has generated average earnings growth of 235% over the past three reports, and analysts are looking for an electric surge of 2,450% when MasTec posts first-quarter results in early May.


Those numbers earned MasTec a spot on IBD's list of [potential breakout stocks expecting 50%-plus EPS growth in Q1](https://www.investors.com/research/q1-earnings-preview-potential-breakout-stocks-expecting-50-plus-growth/).


**Trump Bump Coming?**
----------------------


The Florida-based firm also builds and maintains infrastructure for the renewable-energy, communications, and sewer and water sectors.


MasTec also works on government projects, including communications installations for Air Force bases around the country.


The company, which grew annual revenue 22% last year to $5.1 billion, could benefit if President Trump delivers on his campaign promises to boost infrastructure and defense spending.


A 91 Composite Rating earns MasTec the No. 3 spot among its heavy-construction industry peers, behind **Willdan Group** ([WLDN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLDN)) and **Argan** ([AGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGX)), and ahead of **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) and **Tutor Perini** ([TPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPC)).


Signs of institutional demand for MasTec include a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.2 up/down volume ratio and six quarters of rising fund ownership.


**Testing Support And Resistance**
----------------------------------


After launching a big move last April, MasTec ran into resistance around 40 at the end of the year.


The stock is now working on a later-stage, somewhat-sloppy base-on-base pattern, as it finds support at and bounces off the 10-week moving average.



The relative strength line has been trending essentially sideways, but is still within striking distance of new high ground and has edged upward in recent days.


The stock has shown more up weeks in volume than down weeks within the pattern, another sign of institutional accumulation.


See if the general market uptrend holds and MasTec can punch through the 42 buy point in heavy trade.

When looking for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), start with highly rated companies in the top-ranked industry groups. Also review stocks that have earned a spot on [S&P 500-beating screens](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) like the IBD 50. As one of the best software stocks to watch currently, **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) meets both those criteria and is trading just below a new buy zone.




RealPage is one of four stocks in the Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/). The other three are fellow [IBD 50 stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), plus **SPS Commerce** ([SPSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPSC)). The group ranks No. 14 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


In addition to the four companies above, 13 stocks in the wider software sector also sport 99 Composite Ratings, including IBD 50 stocks **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).

30 Million Residents, 600 Billion Transactions
----------------------------------------------


Based in Texas, RealPage provides on-demand software for rental property managers and owners. Its family of software-as-a-service (SaaS) products handles everything from rental applications and resident screening to income management and data analytics. RealPage serves over 12,400 clients worldwide from offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.


Managing rental properties with over 30 million residents, RealPage's platform processes over 600 billion transactions annually.


The company has a proven track record of solid earnings and sales growth. Quarterly revenue gains have ranged from 13% to 34% over the last eight reports, and RealPage has reported four straight quarters of rising sales growth. The company has posted average EPS growth of 49% over the last three quarters.


Boosted by a 19% annual pretax profit margin and 17% return on equity, the company earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE.


Although RealPage's C- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 0.7 up/down volume ratio are less than ideal, institutional investors have shown interest in the stock. RealPage has seen eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership and 71 funds with an A+ IBD rating own shares in the company.


Best Software Stocks To Buy And Watch
-------------------------------------


RealPage was first featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-tech-stock-realpage-rental-property-software-provider-forms-chart-pattern/) on Sept. 20, 2016 while working on what became a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 26.54 entry. After breaking out in October, the stock rose 133% before pulling back to form its current flat base in May of this year.


The buy point is 62.05, but keep in mind that it's a later-stage pattern. Buying breakouts from such bases involves more risk since the stock has already made a big move at that point. On Friday, RealPage gained 2.4% to close at 60.85, 2% below the entry. Volume was below average, but rising.


In morning trading Monday, the stock is bouncing back from an earlier decline is now down just marginally to 60.77.



ServiceNow and Palo Alto Networks are two more of the best software stocks to buy and watch that are in or near potential buy zones. Palo Alto Networks broke past a 219.48 entry Friday in strong volume. It closed the week within the buy range, which extends to 230.45. The stock is now 3% above the entry. ServiceNow rose nearly 5% Friday, leaving it just 1% below a 194.91 buy point. Volume spiked well above above average. In early trading Monday, ServiceNow is testing the entry in volume that is trending much higher than normal.

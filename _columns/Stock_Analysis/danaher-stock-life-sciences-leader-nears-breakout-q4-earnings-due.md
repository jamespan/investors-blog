------------------------------


Boosted by an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) and a 22.5% annual pretax profit margin, [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) has been steady and strong. Danaher stock sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


While Danaher stock did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-in-these-tech-stocks-to-watch-ipo-stocks/), 194 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in the stock. Plus, several funds on the [IBD Mutual Fund Index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-stocks-are-best-mutual-funds-buying-your-watchlist-stocks-how-to-find-out/) own it, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and MFS Growth (MFEGX).


Danaher has posted two quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a 62% spike in Q3. Sales growth has also picked up steam, going from a 3% increase in Q1 to a 34% gain in the third quarter.


Consensus analyst estimates call for a 43% EPS increase in Q4 and a 37% gain for the full year. Analysts see Danaher's earnings rising 20% in 2021.


Can Danaher Stock Get A Handle On Its New Base?
-----------------------------------------------


Friday marks Day 4 of a [potential handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) for Danaher stock. Handles take a minimum of five days to form. If the stock completes the handle, the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) would be 245.06.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) has slipped as Danaher stock has formed its current base. Look for the RS line to near a new 52-week high ahead of any breakout attempt.


Keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports earnings. Instead, you can reduce you risk by waiting for a stock to report and see how Wall Street reacts.


In the final hour of trading for the week, Danaher stock managed to come off its lows and end just within positive territory.

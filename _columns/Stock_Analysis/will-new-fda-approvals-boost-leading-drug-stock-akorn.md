As IBD noted on Jan. 15, there are [three reasons](http://news.investors.com/011515-734872-generic-drugmaker-akorn-eyes-big-2015.htm) why top-rated pharmaceuticals stock **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) could have a bullish 2015.

  

First, Akorn — which specializes in difficult-to-manufacture dosage forms, including injectables, opthalmics, oral liquids and inhalables — is expected to beat on earnings easily when it reports in early March.

  

Second, its 14 new product approvals should start to pay off this year.

  

Third, Akorn has a competitive advantage with its new ophthalmic solution, which is used to treat certain eye conditions and recently received FDA approval.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Akorn currently holds the No. 1 spot on the IBD 50, and you can see the reason why in the stock's fundamentals.

  

Earnings growth has jumped from 23% to 80% over the last two quarters, and sales growth has come in at 96% and 62% during the same periods.

  

Analysts expect 2014 earnings growth of 105%, followed by a 59% gain this year. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Akorn sports a solid 27% return on equity, and its Medical-Generic Drugs industry group currently ranks No. 13. Those numbers help the stock earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

Akorn's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a mediocre C, but that's up from a D- in December.

  

Akorn's Up/Down Volume Ratio has also improved from a 0.8 earlier in the week to its current 1.0 reading.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After consolidating for more than a year, Akorn launched a new run in August 2013. It consolidated again in November 2013 and came out of that formation in May of last year.

  

After hitting a new all-time high, Akorn sold off in November due to an earnings report complicated by accounting issues.

  

Since then, it's been forming a new base. While it may look like a double bottom, it's not a double bottom, because the low in the second leg down did not undercut the low in the first leg down.

  

More aggressive investors might have used the peak in the middle as an earlier entry, since it does represent a prior point of resistance.

  

Akorn broke past that alternative 42.64 buy point on Tuesday, then fell back below it on Wednesday. Volume on that retreat was below average and lower than on prior up days.

  

The more traditional buy point is 45.35, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if Akorn can clear the price on volume at least 40% - 50% above average.

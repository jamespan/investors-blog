Over the last three quarters, mortgage lender **PennyMac Financial Services** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)) has generated average earnings growth of 249%. That includes a 141% spike to $2.67 per share in the second quarter. Now PennyMac stock has just launched a spectacular breakout to an all-time high.




PennyMac Flies Back Into Growth Mode
------------------------------------


Founded in 2008, PennyMac Financial Services is focused on the production and servicing of U.S. mortgage loans. It also manages investments related to the U.S. mortgage market. It employs roughly 3,900 people across the country.


After wading through five quarters of declining or lackluster earnings and sales growth, PennyMac began flashing a sharp turnaround at the end of last year.


Now building on its impressive earnings growth over the last three quarters, analysts expect PennyMac to deliver a 58% increase to $2.80 per share in Q3, followed by a 481% year-over-year spike to $2.82 in Q4.


Sales growth has also been on the rise. After posting just a 1% year-over-year gain to $306 million in the first quarter, revenue accelerated 21% over the prior-year quarter to $406 million. Going forward, analysts expect that momentum to continue, forecasting gains of 25%, 37% and 60% through Q1 of 2025.


PennyMac Stock Ignites Breakout To Record High
----------------------------------------------


Continuing Wednesday's rebound, the Nasdaq reclaimed its 50-day moving average on Thursday and closed the week solidly above it. Meanwhile, PennyMac stock has just launched an impressive breakout to an all-time high with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) spiking to a 52-week high.


On Aug. 30, the mortgage lender cleared a 105.94 buy point in an early-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle).


The stock showed strength when the Nasdaq sold off sharply at the start of September. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank, shares of PennyMac held tough under that pressure and stayed in buy range.


On Thursday, PennyMac stock soared to the top of its buy range. On Friday, the mortgage lender unleashed even more gains, gapping up at the open. The stock ended Friday's session with an 8% gain for the week.


Further confirming PennyMac's technical strength, its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) are both on the rise. PennyMac trades solidly above both of those thresholds.

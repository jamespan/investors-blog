Yes, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) remains one of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) alongside **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). But top funds continue to devour shares of **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) as [Tesla](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/) continues its slide. Broadcom stock now accounts for a greater percentage of the Nasdaq's market capitalization than the electric-vehicle pioneer.




While not considered one of the Magnificent Seven, Broadcom accounts for 1.9% of the Nasdaq's market cap weighting, topping the 1.6% for Tesla. And the artificial intelligence player is prompting leading money managers to keep gorging on the AI stock.


Joining [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/nvidia-nvda-stock-google-ai-deal/), [Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), Broadcom made this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-uber-msft-google-meta/). Tesla has not made this screen since [August](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/meta-stock-tesla-google-panw-lead-ai-stocks-to-watch-as-best-mutual-funds-fuel-artificial-intelligence-lovefest/).


In the latest report, top-performing money managers scooped up more than $1.9 billion worth of shares in Broadcom. Also accounting for massive capital inflows by these savvy money managers were Nvidia at $12.3 billion, Microsoft with $11.4 billion, Meta at roughly $7 billion, and Alphabet at $3.7 billion.


Broadcom stock also has earned a spot on theÂ [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), joining Nvidia and Meta.


Broadcom Unveils Slew Of AI Innovations
---------------------------------------


Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Broadcom designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor, enterprise software and security solutions. From cloud computing and data centers to storage, broadband and networking, the AI stock helps power artificial intelligence and other technologies integral to today's world.


Earlier this month, [Broadcom and Google Cloud](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/broadcom-and-google-cloud-announce-expanded-partnership-to-help-accelerate-innovation-for-enterprises) expanded their partnership, aiming to optimize Broadcom's VMware workloads for Google Cloud. The companies will collaborate on go-to-market initiatives, adding more Broadcom products and services to Google Cloud Marketplace. Broadcom will also infuse Google Cloud's generative AI capabilities.


Nvidia also announced its expanded collaboration with Google Cloud at the [Google Cloud Next '24](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/nvidia-nvda-stock-google-ai-deal/) event in Las Vegas.


In March, Broadcom delivered [Bailly](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/61946), the industry's first co-packaged optics Ethernet switch for customers that runs at 51.2 terabits per second. That same month, the company also expanded its leadership on [AI optical components](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/61941) and debuted its [WatchTower Platform](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/61886).


Broadcom says the platform improves business performance by streamlining identification and resolution of high-priority incidents in the mainframe environment through enhanced visibility across information-technology silos.


Market Mayhem Hits Broadcom Stock
---------------------------------


Individual stocks like Broadcom, Nvidia and Google do not operate in a vacuum. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank farther below its 50-day moving average Friday and IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) has now declined from a recent 80%-100% to [0%-20%](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/). The market's change in tone has impacted Broadcom stock.


The AI leader has formed a consolidation pattern with a 1,438.17 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Broadcom dropped farther below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on Friday, failing to get an end-of-week bounce.


Meanwhile, [Nvidia crashed below its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks-nvidia-nvda-stock/) on Friday, clearly changing the look of its [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/).


Google stock showed more resilience, managing to hold its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It closed right around the buy point it initially cleared on April 1.


In other Mag 7 news, despite [Cathie Wood continuing to buy Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-elon-musk-blindingly-obvious-to-focus-on-autonomy-cathie-wood-keeps-buying/), shares of the electric-car maker remain trapped well below their 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, all of which keep trending downward. The EV maker fell again Friday after getting hit with a [downgrade on a "thesis-changing" shift](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-new-52-week-low-after-downgrade-on-thesis-changing-shift/) earlier in the week.

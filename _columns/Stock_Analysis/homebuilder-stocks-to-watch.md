Homebuilder stocks jumped Thursday, and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) nailed down some of the biggest gains. Despite a [slowdown in mortgage applications](http://news.investors.com/business/081315-766457-homebuilder-stocks-lift-despite-mortgage-applications-slowdown.htm) for new-home purchases in July, D.R. Horton and other builders have been boosted by a downtrend this summer in the 10-year Treasury yield, which helps keep a lid on mortgage rates. [China's devaluation of the yuan](http://news.investors.com/081315-766432-devalued-yuan-lowers-us-mortgage-rates.htm) has helped push that yield lower.

  

Several homebuilders, including **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), have broken out in recent weeks.

  

On Wednesday, UBS upgraded D.R. Horton and **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) from neutral to buy.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

In the June-ended quarter, sales growth came in north of 30% for the fourth straight quarter, and earnings accelerated from 5% in the March-ended quarter to 88%.

  

Strong demand for the stock is reflected in the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 up/down volume ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

D.R. Horton rose more than 3% on July 28 after reporting Q2 earnings, then cleared a 28.80 buy point two days later.

  

It was a first-stage consolidation because it undercut a prior low back in January to reset the base count.

  

There's been no shortage of [stalled breakouts](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/759629-how-to-handle-a-stalled-breakout.aspx) recently, and D.R. Horton also slipped back below the buy point. But volume around the breakout was much heavier than on the pullback, showing that large investors were not selling aggressively.

  

Volume picked up on Wednesday and Thursday as the stock again moved higher.

  

D.R. Horton is now extended beyond the 28.80 to 30.24 buy zone, but see if it goes on to offer an [alternative entry](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736316&sourceid=735787).

Sharing the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating with fellow specialty financial services firms **Sezzle** ([SEZL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEZL)) and **Marex** ([MRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRX)), **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) spiked 73% from a breakout in July. In addition to launching a now-challenged jump past a new buy point, Tradeweb has just announced a new partnership with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.




Based in New York City, Tradeweb builds and operates marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets. For more than 2,800 institutional, wholesale, retail and corporate market participants, it provides liquidity and data solutions to help streamline price discovery, order execution and trade workflows.


In November, Tradeweb saw average daily volume (ADV) of $2.35 trillion, an increase of 30.5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of its [acquisition of Institutional Cash Distributors (ICD)](https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-completes-acquisition-of-icd/), which closed in August, total ADV for the month showed a year-over-year gain of 14.9%.


On Nov. 11, [Tradeweb and the Tokyo Exchange](https://investors.tradeweb.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tradeweb-and-tokyo-stock-exchange-collaborate-expand-liquidity) announced a collaboration to expand liquidity in Japanese exchange traded funds. With a focus on linking liquidity pools, Tradeweb, in conjunction with the exchange's Conneqtor platform, aims to help institutional investors looking to transfer risk with a higher degree of certainty.


Tradeweb In Demand From Solid Growth
------------------------------------


Five quarters of rising fund ownership and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) point to demand for [Tradeweb stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tradeweb-markets-tw.aspx). Plus, 12 funds with an A+ rating from Investor's Business Daily own shares of the company.


Over the last three quarters, the financial services firm has generated average earnings growth of 34%. Sales growth also has been in double digits, ranging from 24% to 37% over the last four quarters.


In the third quarter, Tradeweb posted sales of $448.9 million, while earnings rose 36% to 75 cents a share. For the full year, analysts are predicting earnings growth of 28% to $2.90 per share.


Tradeweb Stock Pops To New High Then Pulls Back
-----------------------------------------------


In addition to its position among the [best large-cap stocks to watch](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), Tradeweb also earns a spot on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/) alongside [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)). Note that industry peer Marex is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) screens.


Running into selling pressure, Tradeweb stock has slipped below a [trendline entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) near 133. On Thursday, it also shot get back above a 136.14 [flat-base entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) it first cleared in November. But after spiking above 141, shares retreated. The stock fell 4% on Friday.


Tradeweb is now testing two key benchmarks — the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The stock has dropped below the 21-day line while closing slightly under its 50-day. On the positive side, note that benchmark lines have so far continued to display an upward trajectory.


As with industry peers [Sezzle](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-sezzle-sezl.aspx) and [Marex](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-marex-group-mrx.aspx), the 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) for Tradeweb shows it is outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical stock-picking factors.


The specialty financial services groups ranks a strong No. 10 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.

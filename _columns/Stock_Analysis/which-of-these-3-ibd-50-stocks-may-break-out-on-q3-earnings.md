Along with **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and September IPO **Micro Focus International** ([MFGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFGP)), **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) is one of four companies in the highly ranked specialty enterprise software group currently on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks — and the only one still in a potential buy range.









 
 
 Atlassian, which provides online collaboration solutions, bolted nearly 25% in massive volume on Oct. 20 after reporting earnings. As of Wednesday's close, United Kingdom-based company is extended and up 24% from the buy point.
Alarm.com, which is also on the [IPO Leaders list](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) as one of the [top-performing newer issues](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), is expected to report Q3 earnings in mid-November.


Alarm.com was [featured in the IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/no-1-ranked-security-smart-home-tech-stock-may-unlock-new-breakout/) in August, just as it broke out of a second-stage flat base and rose as much as 28% in less than three months. The stock is now extended, but is testing support at its 50-day line for the second time since the breakout. Alarm.com was down nearly 2% Wednesday.


Micro Focus International, a United Kingdom-based firm that supports the technology needs of the Forbes Global 2000, went public last month and has already earned a spot on the IBD 50. Micro Focus broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) last week and is now out of buy range after adding another 1% gain on Wednesday.


Leading Stock In Highly Ranked Group
------------------------------------


With a 97 Composite Rating, RealPage earns the No. 3 spot among its industry peers. Alarm.com and Atlassian are all tied for the top spot with the highest-possible 99 rating, while **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) comes in at No. 2 with a 98.


The group itself ranks No. 27 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


RealPage, which provides rental property management software and data analytics for the real estate industry, has a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 30% and an A SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Last week, [RealPage announced it was buying PEX Software](http://investor.realpage.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2017/10-23-2017-212019230), a London-based provider of property management, online leasing and resident software solutions. PEX serves the United Kingdom, European Union and Australian markets.


Near Buy Point With Earnings Due
--------------------------------


With third-quarter earnings due Nov. 2, RealPage is working on a flat base as part of a third-stage base-on-base. Keep in mind that it's risky to buy a stock just before it reports and that later-stage patterns are more likely to fail than first- or second-stage consolidations.



On Wednesday, RealPage was up 1.6% to 44, putting it just above the 43.75 buy point, which it briefly cleared earlier on Oct. 25. Volume was well above average.


In the bottom of the base, the stock found support right around the buy point in the prior pattern. It's also been finding good support along the 10-day moving average.


Analysts expect a 15% rise in EPS for Q3. Consensus estimates were recently revised higher. See if Thursday's report closes the deal and sends RealPage higher or rejects the stock's breakout bid.

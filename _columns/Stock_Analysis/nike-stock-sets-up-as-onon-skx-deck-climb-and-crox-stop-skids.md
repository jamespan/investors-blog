Outpacing 94% of all stocks in terms of key stock-picking factors, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) joins four highly rated peers with powerhouse [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?), including **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)), **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) and **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)).




In March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average member [crushed earnings estimates and hiked its full-year guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/nke-stock-nike-earnings-q3-consumer-demand-inflation/). But excess inventories weighed on margins. Nike stock has taken that blemish in stride as it now looks to lace up for a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Although earnings growth slowed 9% to 79 cents a share in fiscal Q3 (ended Feb. 28), that beat Wall Street expectations by over 42%. Analysts forecast a 14% earnings slowdown for the full year, but see Nike rebounding to 24% EPS growth in the next fiscal year.


Footwear In Fashion
-------------------


With the exception of Crocs, each of these leaders in the Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing group is showing  strength.


After reporting earnings on April 27, CROX stock gapped down in heavy volume, sliding below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). On Friday came off its lows to recoup some of those losses.


As Nike stock warms up for a fresh jump into buy range, Deckers and Skechers test new all-time highs and ONON stock keeps on climbing.

Nike Gets Its Digital Swagger On With .SWOOSH
---------------------------------------------


In April, Nike unveiled [.SWOOSH](https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/swoosh-drops-first-virtual-collection), a new platform for virtual creations. Debuting its first digital-creation collection — Our Force 1 (OF1), co-curated by the .SWOOSH community — the move accelerates Nike's digital transformation.


The platform uses blockchain-powered technology — what many call "web3." Through .SWOOSH, Nike envisions "an inclusive, equitable place for athletes, creators, collectors and consumers to design and own the future of sport."


On May 10, Nike will open general access to the entire .SWOOSH community to purchase an OF1 virtual creation.


It's Game On For Nike Stock
---------------------------


With earnings now behind it, Nike stock is taking aim at a 131.41 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#flatbase).


It's a first-stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/) because the footwear and apparel giant undercut the low in its prior formation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). Such early stage patterns have a higher likelihood of success.


After dropping from November 2021 to September 2022, Nike came out of its slump with several straight up weeks starting in October. The stock continued to climb until easing back to form its current flat base.


Nike stock has now flashed several weeks of tight closes. Such action is healthy and could mean Nike is coiling up to spring sharply higher.


With the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) under pressure, investors should proceed with caution. But if the market regains its strength, a breakout in heavy volume could jump-start a new run for Nike stock.

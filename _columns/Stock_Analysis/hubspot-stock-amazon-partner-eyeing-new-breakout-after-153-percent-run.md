In December, marketing technology firm **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) announced a three-year partnership with **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) through Amazon Web Services (AWS). And after already making a 153% run, HubSpot stock is now promoting a new potential breakout.




According to HubSpot, through the [Amazon Web Services partnership](https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/hubspot-announces-three-year-collaboration-with-amazon-web-services-to-support-the-startup-ecosystem), "HubSpot will leverage AWS services to expand its platform and provide added benefits to members of the Connect and HubSpot for Startups program."


HubSpot and Amazon are also supporting the Connect program by co-investing to develop an ecosystem for HubSpot partners. Participants in the program can leverage AWS services, generating credits that can be applied to their Amazon Web Services accounts.

HubSpot Stock Delivers Triple-Digit EPS Growth; Can It Continue?
----------------------------------------------------------------


Over the last five quarters, HubSpot has generated earnings growth ranging from 140% to 467%. The Cambridge, MA-based company posted revenue gains of 33% to 39% during the same period.


Look for HubSpot to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 6, with market watchers expecting a 32% rise in earnings for the quarter.


For 2019, analysts are looking for 42% EPS growth, followed by a 32% increase in 2020.


HubSpot stock has a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), coming in behind **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) (99) and **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) (98). [Atlassian is up sharply](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/atlassian-earnings-pop-team-stock-q22019/) in heavy volume Friday after reporting earnings and topping analyst estimates. RealPage is also rising.


Along with Atlassian and RealPage, HubSpot is part of the No. 46-ranked specialty software enterprise industry group.


[Institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) is currently one potential weak spot for HubSpot stock. It has a C- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), 0.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/), and the number of funds that hold the stock fell last quarter. However, those numbers can change quickly, especially if HubSpot delivers a strong earnings report.


Will Amazon Partnership Help Lift HubSpot Stock Into Buy Zone?
--------------------------------------------------------------


We featured HubSpot in the Sept. 22, 2017 [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/will-ai-chatbots-program-new-breakout-for-top-tech-ipo-hubspot/) as it launched a 153% run over the next 21 months. After hitting a new all-time high in May 2019, the stock pulled back to form an early-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) base.


While HubSpot's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remains below a new 52-week high, the stock is approaching a possible 187.41 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Keep in mind that it's risky to buy a stock just before it reports earnings. But keep an eye on HubSpot to see if it can clear the entry in strong volume after the company releases its latest quarterly performance numbers.

Retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is forming another base as it displays signs of strong support.

  

Since breaking out of a double bottom last fall 1, the stock has consistently found support along its 10-week moving average 2.

  

Even while forming a base-on-base pattern 3, Lululemon didn't drop significantly below the line. This tells you that institutional investors were stepping in to keep the stock above the benchmark.

  

Lululemon broke out of the base-on-base on March 28 and made decent gains until it began pulling back the past several weeks.

  

The stock found support right at its 10-week line 4 after gliding to that level in below-average volume â€” another sign that institutions still like Lululemon.

  

For three weeks, the stock has made weekly price closes near the prior week's close 5, an example of tight action that suggests institutional investors are holding their shares or calmly adding some more.

  

The potential buy point for Lululemon's new base is 102.93 unless a handle develops and provides a lower one.

As **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) works on a first-stage base, here are 3 reasons the social media giant could be laying the groundwork for a new climb.

  

**1. Multiple "Growth Levers"**

  

Facebook still has [multiple product channels](http://news.investors.com/technology/091415-770809-facebook-revenue-growth-plans-include-video-instagram-messenger-whatsapp.htm) that could drive significant profits as its rivalry with **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), Snapchat and others heats up.

  

Last week, the company announced the [aggressive expansion of advertising on Instagram](http://news.investors.com/technology/090915-770168-facebook-expands-instagram-ads-to-30-more-countries.htm), the popular photo-sharing service it bought in 2012.

  

According to [eMarketer](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Instagram-Mobile-Ad-Revenues-Reach-281-Billion-Worldwide-2017/1012774), Instagram is expected to generate a nearly five-fold increase in mobile ad revenue, from $595 million this year to $2.81 billion in 2017.

  

Facebook is also aggressively challenging Google-owned YouTube for a bigger slice of the online video advertising pie. [Fortune](http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/facebook-video-explosion/?xid=yahoo_fortune) reported that the social network's users have been watching an average of 4 billion videos daily in 2015 â€” four times more than last year's number.

  

While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not said exactly when they'll start ramping up monetization of Messenger and WhatsApp, the popular messaging service it bought for $19 billion in 2014, both could help Facebook expand its share of the all-important mobile advertising market.

  

**2. Rising Institutional Demand**

  

A second reason Facebook may be getting ready to move higher is the rising demand for the stock among fund managers. In addition to eight quarters of increasing fund ownership, Facebook made IBD's latest list of [New Buys by Top-Performing Stock Funds For Past Three Months](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/090215-769383-top-mutual-funds-like-homebuilders.htm).

  

**3. Early-Stage Base and Rising Relative Strength Line**

  

Facebook [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) last month, making its current pattern a first-stage consolidation. And its Relative Strength line has been trending into new high ground as the stock builds the right side of the base.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Of course, no stock is perfect and Facebook's earnings and sales growth has been slowing in recent quarters. An 82% rise in expenses put a crimp in the company's profits, but the 16% rise in Q2 EPS actually beat estimates.

  

The social media leader sports a solid 18% return on equity and a 56% annual EPS growth rate, helping it earn a 98 Composite Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Facebook reset the base count during the Aug. 24 flash crash, when the new low undercut the low in the prior base.

  

In recent days, the stock has rebounded but continues to test the 10-week moving average.

  

See if volume on up days can pick up as Facebook continues to build the right side of the base and gets closer to the 99.34 buy point, calculated by adding 10 cents to peak on the left.

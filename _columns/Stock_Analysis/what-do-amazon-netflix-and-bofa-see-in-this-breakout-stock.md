Fellow [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), as well as **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), have at least one thing in common: They all use cloud-based human resources and payroll solutions from **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)).


According to Workday's website, Amazon says Workday "will support Amazon as we continue to hire employees around the world." Netflix says that, since switching to Workday, "we now have HR, payroll and financials in one application."


Amazon, Netflix and BofA share another thing with Workday: They've all broken out recently, but with varying degrees of success. Amazon, Netflix and BofA are all still in buy range, but for BofA, it has retreated back into range after rising nearly 10% from a Sept. 27 breakout. Netflix has also struggled in recent days, pulling back all the way to its 190.05 buy point, where it found support on Friday.


On Wednesday, Workday rose over 2% to re-enter the 110.69-116.22 buy zone it originally moved into on Oct. 31. But the return was short-lived, as it sold off Thursday along with the indexes.


700% Earnings Growth — With This Caveat
---------------------------------------


In fiscal 2018 Q2 (ended July 31), Workday posted a 700% spike in earnings, but that was based on comparison to a year-over-year quarter with a loss. Analysts expect 400% EPS growth in fiscal Q3, and a 592% gain for the full year.


Second-quarter sales growth increased to 41%, marking four straight quarters of rising revenue gains. The company has a three-year annual top-line growth rate of 42%, but subpar numbers for its return on equity (2.3%) and annual pretax profit margin (1.6%).


Signs of institutional demand are mixed. After Thursday's decline, the up/down volume ratio fell to 1.0 and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating dropped to a C. But Workday has seen three quarters of rising fund ownership.


Procuring A Breakout?
---------------------


Workday made a nice run from its October 2012 IPO until peaking in February 2014, but then slipped into a multiyear slump. The stock is now working on a  [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 110.69 entry, which it initially cleared on Oct. 31.


As the indexes sold off Thursday, Workday dropped over 4% and closed below its 50-day line. On Friday, Workday closed up over 1% to close just below that key benchmark.


See if the stock can move solidly above the 50-day moving average and climb back into buy range in heavy volume.

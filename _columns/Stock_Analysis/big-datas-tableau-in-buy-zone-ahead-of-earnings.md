The best stocks are often younger, innovative leaders in a fast-growing industry. And **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)), which had its IPO in 2013, fits that bill.

  

It's a key player in the big data space, where analytics software firms like Tableau and 2012 IPO stock **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) help businesses track and make use of the massive amounts of info flowing through their networks.

  

Just as the rise of cloud computing and the [Internet of Things (IoT)](http://news.investors.com/business/041515-748087-general-electric-industrial-internet-predictive-analytics.htm) revolution are driving demand for cybersecurity and identity theft protection firms like [CyberArk Software](http://news.investors.com/investing-ipo-analysis/041515-748009-hot-ipos-near-buy-points.htm) ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and [Palo Alto Networks](http://news.investors.com/technology/041315-747539-palo-alto-networks-fireeye-viewed-as-top-security-stocks.htm) ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), those same trends are generating increased demand for Tableau's highly visual and cloud-based business intelligence tools.

  

Last week, Tableau announced a partnership with Cerner, which develops medical records management software and other solutions for health care providers. The two firms will use interactive data exploration to help health care organizations identify trends that might otherwise go undetected.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Demand for Tableau's big data tools is reflected in its sales growth, which has ranged from 62% to 95% over the last eight quarters.

  

Earnings growth has been more sporadic, but did jump 110% in Q4. Tableau is scheduled to report first quarter numbers on May 7. For the full year, analysts expect negative EPS growth, followed by a triple-digit rebound in 2016.

  

Tableau's 8% return on equity is well below the 17% benchmark you'd prefer, but overall it earns a respectable 93 Composite Rating. Signs of demand for the stock include the B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio and the rise in fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since going public in May 2013, Tableau Software's share price has essentially doubled, but it hasn't been a smooth ride.

  

The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base in January 2014 and managed to reach the 20%-25% profit-taking zone, but then fell into a long and bumpy consolidation.

  

On the positive side, that did [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx), since the new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.

  

Tableau bolted higher in February when it announced triple-digit earnings growth for Q4. It then began forming a shallow double-bottom pattern with a 99.39 buy point.

  

Early Thursday morning, the stock climbed above that entry on promising volume. The buying range is up to 5% above the buy point, from 99.39 to 104.36.

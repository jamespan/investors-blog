The direction of the general market can impact a stock for better or worse. A bear market or correction can act as a head wind, while a bull market can act as a tail wind.

  

A stock that breaks out may have a tough time gaining ground during a correction. The stock can also go on to form a base-on-base pattern. **Ancestry.com** ([ACOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACOM)) appears to be doing that now.

  

The stock came public in November 2009 and has been in a strong uptrend, more than tripling.

  

Ancestry.com has offered several buying opportunities along the way. The stock broke out in late February 2010 1 and then again in September 2. It also had a three-weeks-tight in November 3.

  

In late April, a blowout earnings report sent Ancestry.com gapping up past a 38.79 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. The stock surged 18% before pulling back.

  

Ancestry.com is now eight weeks into a new base. Since the stock climbed less than 20% before settling into a new consolidation, Ancestry.com should be regarded as forming a base-on-base pattern 4.

  

A few areas of tight weekly closes in the base-on-base serve as evidence of institutional buying.

When searching for the best stocks to buy and watch, a good starting point is to look at names like cloud-based software stock **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), a leading company in a top-rated industry group.




Along with **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)), Salesforce is one of four stocks in the No. 1-ranked enterprise software industry group with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. Each of these stocks is also currently in or near a new buy zone.


**RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), which was featured in the [Jan. 12 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/microsoft-cisco-rival-ringcentral-near-breakout/) just as it broke out to a 40%-plus gain, is just behind its peers with a 98 Composite Rating. The provider of communication software jumped back into a new buy zone this week and remains within buy range.


While Salesforce doesn't share a spot on IBD's [S&P 500-beating Sector Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) with Baozun and Ultimate Software, it is on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), along with ServiceNow.

Salesforce Earnings Due
-----------------------


Co-founded in 1999 by former **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) executive Marc Benioff, Salesforce was an early pioneer in the development of software-as-a-service (SaaS). The San Francisco-based company is now a leading provider of custom relationship management (CRM) software, generating over $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018, ended Jan. 31.


International Data Corporation (IDC) just [named Salesforce the No. 1 provider of CRM software](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-named-1-crm-provider-125000347.html) for the fifth consecutive year.


As part of its plan to keep growing by driving clients' digital transformation, [Salesforce recently completed its acquisition of MuleSoft](https://investor.salesforce.com/about-us/investor/investor-news/investor-news-details/2018/Salesforce-Completes-Acquisition-of-MuleSoft/default.aspx), whose cloud-based Anypoint Platform will become part of the Salesforce Integration Cloud.


Salesforce is scheduled to file fiscal 2019 Q1 earnings report May 29. Analysts are looking for a 67% rise in earnings per share, which would mark a sharp jump from Saleforce.com's 25% increase last quarter.


The company has grown earnings at an average annual clip of 36% over the last three years. Revenue gains have been strong and steady, ranging from 24% to 27% over the last eight reports.


Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Earnings
-------------------------------


On Wednesday, Salesforce.com poked its head just above a 128.97 buy point, ending the day at 129.73. While the relative strength line was floating near a new high, volume was below average. Look for heavier trading to kick in to show more conviction for a new breakout move.


The buy zone extends to 135.42.


On a stock chart, you can see how Salesforce has consistently found support at its 10-week line, and at its prior buy points during its current run-up. Such action forms "steppingstones" that help a stock continue to climb.



ServiceNow also broke out Wednesday, clearing a 176.66 buy point. Volume was above average, but shy of the 40% or greater spike you look for on a breakout day. Ultimate Software continues to test a 258.03 entry, while Baozun ended today's session 6% below a 52.43 buy point.


RingCentral rose almost 2% Wednesday, lifting it to the upper end of the 69.70 to 73.19 buy zone. [RingCentral reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ringcentral-earnings-revenue-top-expectations/) after the market close, topping revenue expectations and offering an outlook above analyst views.

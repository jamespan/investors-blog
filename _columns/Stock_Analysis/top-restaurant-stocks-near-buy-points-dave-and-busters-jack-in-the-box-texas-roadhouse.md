If the postelection chart action of **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) and **Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)) is any indication, Donald Trump's surprise win may make restaurant stocks great again. And **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) may be among the next eatery equities to serve up a new breakout.


Although each has a Composite Rating below 90, Dave & Buster's, **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) and Jack In The Box are all [approaching potential new buy zones](https://www.investors.com/news/jack-in-the-box-dave-busters-near-buy-points-ahead-of-earnings/). Papa John's International has already broken out.


The pizza giant's 93 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 ranking among restaurant stocks, followed by Jack In The Box and Dave & Buster's, both with an 88 rating.


Earnings On Tap
---------------


Dave & Buster's sports a 79% three-year EPS growth rate, but profit gains cooled off to 25% in its most recent report. Sales growth also slowed to 12%.


The Dallas-based company, which operates 87 restaurant-arcade venues offering patrons an opportunity to "Eat, Drink, Play and Watch," is set to report fiscal 2016 third-quarter results on Dec. 6.


For the full fiscal year, which ends Jan. 29, analysts expect earnings to rise 28%, followed by a 15% rise in the next fiscal year. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher by analysts.


Getting A Handle On Its Base
----------------------------


The 2014 IPO retook its 10-week line following Trump's election, and just added a handle to a [double-bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) to establish a 46.94 entry.


On Friday, Dave & Buster's rebounded off its 10-day moving average to close 3% below the buy point.



A 1.5 up/down volume ratio and seven quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional interest in the stock.


Look for Dave & Buster's to clear the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal, and see what type of numbers it reports on Dec. 6.

As e-commerce services provider **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) tests a new buy zone and **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) continues to wobble, fellow top Chinese stock **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is within striking distance of a double-bottom breakout.




Alibaba is the largest investor in Baozun, which also claims **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) as a partner. Alibaba and Baozun have both earned a spot on the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://research.beta.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


[Baozun beat analyst estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/baozun-shares-jump-after-first-quarter-earnings-top-estimates/) when it reported earnings before Thursday's market open, sparking a nearly 19% gain for the day. The stock added another 2.5% Friday to close the week at the upper end of the 52.43 to 55.05 buy zone. In early trading Monday, Baozun is pulling back, but finding support at the buy point.


Former [leading Chinese stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) Weibo has continued to struggle and is now below both its 10-week and 40-week moving averages.

Alibaba Earns Top Spot In Highly Rated Industry
-----------------------------------------------


With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Alibaba holds the No. 1 position in the No. 15-ranked internet retailers industry group. **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Shutterfly** ([SFLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFLY)) round out the top five leaders.


Like Amazon, Alibaba has expanded into a wide range of businesses beyond e-commerce. Alibaba is now also involved in cloud computing with Alibaba Cloud, payment processing with Alipay and movie and TV production through Alibaba Pictures Group.


While Amazon Web Services (AWS) has emerged as leading [cloud services company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), Alibaba's cloud business is growing quickly. In its most recently reported quarter, Alibaba Cloud generated $699 million in revenue, a 103% increase compared with the prior-year quarter.


While Alibaba's $508.23 billion market cap and $39.9 billion annual revenue trail that of Amazon ($769.36 billion and $177.9 billion, respectively), Alibaba's 48.9% annual pretax profit margin dwarfs Amazon's 2.1% margin.


Double-Bottom Breakout Ahead?
-----------------------------


Alibaba and Amazon have both recently formed [later-stage chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/).


Amazon is trading 1% above the 1,568.62 entry from a cup with handle. Volume on the initial April 27 breakout was 117% above average, but the stock reversed to close the day just above the buy point. Since then, volume has been tepid as Amazon has floated within buy range.


Alibaba has been trading in a tight range in recent days while testing support at its 10-day line as it tries to close in on a 201.60 entry. The stock saw a big spike in volume leading up to and after its May 4 earnings report, then trading lightened up.


Alibaba's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 up/down volume ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership point to strong institutional demand for shares.


In morning trade Monday, Alibaba is up over 2% to 199.11, putting it just below the 201.60 buy point.

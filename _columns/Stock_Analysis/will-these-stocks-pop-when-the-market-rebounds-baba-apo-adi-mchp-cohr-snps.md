 When the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average face increased selling pressure — as they have recently — be very cautious about making any new buys.
But also be very diligent about continuing to track stocks that have strong earnings growth and are showing resilience as others sell off. Those are the stocks that could spring higher when the proverbial anvil is lifted and the market rebounds.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)), **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) currently all fit that bill.


Do Your Stocks Share These Signs Of Resilience?
-----------------------------------------------


In addition to solid earnings and sales growth, see if the stocks you're tracking are displaying the following telltale signs of technical strength and resilience.


* **Support At Important Benchmarks**


Most stocks generally follow the direction of the Nasdaq, S&P and Dow, so it's natural for even top-rated names to give back ground when the indexes run into trouble.


But see if a stock finds support at key benchmarks like the 10-week moving average or a recent buy point. That shows fund managers are stepping in to protect and possibly add to their positions.


 Chinese internet giant Alibaba has stayed above its 10-week line and its 104.67 buy point. On Thursday, the stock rose 2% in volume 37% above average.
Chip designer Synopsys continues to trade in a tight range and hold on to the big gains it made when it gapped up over 6% on Feb 16. The California-based company has also been testing support at its short-term 10-day line.


Apollo Global Management, which was featured earlier this week in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/stock-with-1534-earnings-growth-and-6-dividend-nears-breakout/), has also found support along its 10-day moving average.


* **Building A Base And/Or Showing Tight Trading**


While it's always a good idea to use weekly charts to view a stock's behavior from a longer term perspective, that's especially important when the market is under pressure. The weekly chart smooths out daily fluctuations and volatility that can make a down day seem more alarming than it actually is.


 On the weekly chart, you can see how Apollo, Coherent and Microchip Technology are all forming bases, which could serve as new launchpads once the general market recovers.
In addition to the tight weekly closes Synopsys has been posting, check the weekly chart for Analog Devices.


Since jumping nearly 8% during the week ended Feb. 17, the manufacturer of analog and digital semiconductors has held those gains while trading in a narrow price range.


Tight trading is a sign the stock is holding its ground and may be "unleashed to run" in a better market.


* **Resilient Relative Strength Line**


The Relative Strength line tells you if your stock is outperforming or lagging the S&P 500, which is often used to represent the general market.


 If the RS line continues to trend upward or show resilience in the face of a downturn, it means the stock is a market leader.
The RS line for Microchip Technology was in new high ground as of Wednesday's close as it continued to build a flat base — a potentially bullish sign. Although the  stock fell 1% Thursday, the RS line continues to float near new high territory.


The lines for Analog Devices and Synopsys also point to strength and resilience.


Keep Building Your Watch List
-----------------------------


While patience may be a virtue, preparation is a profit-maker.


When the market pulls back a bit or goes into a full correction, leading stocks will also typically take a breather and form a new base or trade quietly in a tight range.


That's the time to build and refresh your watch list, looking for stocks with strong growth and the traits discussed above. By doing that, you'll be ready to act when the market turns around and leading stocks take off.

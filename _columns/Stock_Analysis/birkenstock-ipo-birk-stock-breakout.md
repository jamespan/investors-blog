**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) co-founder Steve Jobs wore them. Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Margo Robbie and other celebrities have also been spotted donning a pair. **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)) sandals have adorned the feet of people from all walks of life. Now the 2023 IPO has notched a breakout to a record high as it steps into buy range.




Birkenstock Buckled Up Before America Was Born
----------------------------------------------


The shoemaking dynasty traces its roots back to the earliest documented mention of Johannes Birkenstock (1749-1812) in 1774, two years before America declared its independence from England. Fast forward nearly 200 years, and the Birkenstock sandal made its debut in 1964. To honor the now-iconic brand's heritage, Birkenstock launched the 1774 line of sandals in 2020.


Today, Birkenstock has a global footprint with over 6,200 employees around the world.


On May 30, the company [reported a 49% spike in sales for the second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/birkenstock-stock-earnings-consumer-demand/) to $519.4 million. The shoemaker broke a two-quarter slide in earnings growth with a 2% gain to 44 cents a share. The report sent shares of Birkenstock soaring to a one-day gain of more than 11% on the way to an 18% gain for the week.


With Birkenstock set to report fiscal third-quarter numbers on Aug. 29 before the market opens, analysts see continued strong growth going forward. Consensus estimates call for 19% sales growth to $615.3 million. Earnings are expected to rise 21% to 56 cents per share.


For the full fiscal year, Wall Street sees Birkenstock generating an 81% year-over-year jump in earnings to $1.39 per share.


Birkenstock IPO Delivering On Early Promise
-------------------------------------------


From the close of its first week following its IPO in October 2023, Birkenstock rose 33% in eight weeks. It then went through a rough patch but has since managed to hold support along its sharply rising [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Birkenstock just completed and cleared a 61.83 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a still-early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). In a sign of market leadership, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has hit a 52-week high. BIRK stock closed Friday's session in buy range with more than a 7% gain for the week.


Signs of demand for shares of Birkenstock include a B+ [Accumulation/Distrubution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


While it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports earnings, look for Birkenstock to keep building on its rising growth and demand to expand its new breakout move.

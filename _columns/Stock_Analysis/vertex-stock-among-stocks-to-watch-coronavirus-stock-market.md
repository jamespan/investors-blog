Investors are carefully watching the [coronavirus stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), seeing if a new [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) can take hold and launch a sustainable uptrend. Among the list of stocks to watch is **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), which is nearing a new all-time high as its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hits a new 52-week high.




Vertex is a global [biotech company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) that has multiple approved medicines for treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). The spreading coronavirus can cause lung infections and limit one's ability to breathe, [creating particular concern within the cystic fibrosis community](https://www.cff.org/Life-With-CF/Daily-Life/Germs-and-Staying-Healthy/What-Are-Germs/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Community-Questions-and-Answers/).


In March, Vertex Pharmaceuticals said the [coronavirus outbreak would not impact its supply chain or 2020 outlook](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vertex-pharma-says-no-coronavirus-impact-on-supply-chain-or-2020-outlook-2020-03-09). Vertex was featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vrtx-stock-cystic-fibrosis-treatment-shows-buying-opportunities/) in February, following the launch of a key cystic fibrosis treatment.


Vertex stock is currently on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) list of today's leading large caps.

Vertex Stock Jumps On Signs Of Stock Market Rally
-------------------------------------------------


On Thursday, Vertex stock spiked more than 7% in volume above average. The Boston-based stock retook its 10-week moving average and ended the day at the top of its price range.


In a healthy sign of market leadership, the relative strength line bolted higher. That's exactly what you want to see when looking for stocks to watch as a new stock market rally tries to take hold.


But keep in mind that we remain in a volatile market. Especially after a sharp drop-off like we saw with the coronavirus crash, it may take multiple rally attempts before the market finds its footing and establishes an enduring bull run.


In the meantime, investors should get back into the market *gradually* and make sure the ["three big rocks" of CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investing-in-stocks-see-how-to-buy-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) are all in place. If they are and a new rally takes hold, you can continue to add to your positions. If not and the market turns south again, you can get out without putting too much money at risk.


Vertex has posted average annual EPS growth of 86% over the last three years. Revenue gains have averaged 30% per year during the same period, and the company sports a 42.9% pretax profit margin.


Such performance, combined with a sharply rising RS line, makes Vertex one of the top [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/tag/coronavirus-stocks-to-watch/) as we wait to see how the coronavirus stock market plays out.


On Friday, Vertex stock fell 1.6%, but managed to come off its lows for the day. It closed just under 10% hihger for the week.

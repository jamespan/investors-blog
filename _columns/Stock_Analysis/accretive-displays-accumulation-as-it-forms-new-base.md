**Accretive Health** ([AH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AH)) is working on its second base since it came public last year.

  

Its first base was a cup-with-handle pattern that took shape from June 2010 to December 1.

  

Accretive broke out from that structure and ran up, and it's now taking a break to carve out a second base that's shaped somewhat like the letter V 2. Keep in mind that V-shaped bases can be more risky. Ideally, the bottom of the cup would be more rounded, indicating a more controlled, less volatile base.

  

Still, the stock has seen some accumulation as it's climbed the right side of its base 3. That happens on weeks the stock climbs and volume is above average. It tells you some institutional investors are buying.

  

The stock may go on to form a handle on its base. But for now, it's a cup-shaped base with a buy point at 30.75.

  

Chicago-based Accretive handles back-office services for hospitals, including insurance verification, billing and collections. It showed an acceleration in its EPS and sales gains last quarter. The number of U.S. mutual and hedge funds owning the stock has been rising.

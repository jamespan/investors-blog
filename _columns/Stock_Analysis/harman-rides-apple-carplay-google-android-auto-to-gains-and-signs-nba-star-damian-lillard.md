After bolting higher on Q4 earnings in late January, **Harman International** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)) is once again near a buy point as it gets ready to report Q1 numbers on Apr. 30.

  

The Connecticut-based firm has been making audio gear since Eisenhower was president and now sells car audio and infotainment systems under the JBL, AK, Harman/Kardon and Infinity brands.

  

But as [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/020415-737841-harman-international-industries-car-infotainment-systems.htm) column noted in February, Harman's robust financial growth is due more to cutting-edge technology than to traditional audio gear. That's why CEO Dinesh Paliwal says the company is a "pure technology play" driven by the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution and tie-ins with CarPlay from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and Android Auto from **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).

  

Harman continued its push into the world of cloud-based connectivity in January when it spent nearly $1 billion to acquire two companies: Symphony Teleca, which provides software engineering and integration services for numerous markets, including health care, automotive, and telecom; and Redbend Software, which develops software management technology for connected devices.

  

Harman is also the official sound partner of the NBA, and earlier this week signed two-time All-Star Damian Lillard as the JBL Brand Ambassador.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has ranged from 17% to 32% over the last seven quarters. Earnings growth has been even more impressive, and accelerated from 38% to 64% in the latest report.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 33%, followed by a 19% gain in 2016.

  

Harman has a strong 55% annual EPS growth rate and solid 18% return on equity, helping it earn the highest possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

Signs of institutional demand for the stock include the B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio and a nice jump in fund ownership last quarter.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After running into resistance last summer, Harman [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) when the low in its new pattern undercut the low in the prior consolidation.

  

The stock soared out of that base on a strong Q4 earnings report in January, rising over 27% for the week.

  

Since then it's managed to hold onto and even add a bit to those gains as it formed a second-stage flat base with a 145.10 buy point.

  

The stock has shown signs of accumulation in the right side of the pattern, including tight trading and good support along the 10-week line. Plus, the Relative Strength line has moved into new high ground.

  

On Thursday morning, Harman broke past the buy point and was still trading within the 145.10 to 152.35 buying range.

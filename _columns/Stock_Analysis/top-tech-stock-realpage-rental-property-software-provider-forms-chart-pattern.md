Property management software provider **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) may not be a household name, but it's an industry leader with some impressive statistics.


While providing full service rental property management solutions to over 12,000 real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other property owners and managers, RealPage processes over 600 billion transactions annually.


Its clients manage over 11 million rental housing units and more than 200 million square feet of commercial office, retail, industrial and mixed use properties.


No. 1 Among Industry Peers
--------------------------


After several quarters of negative earnings growth, RealPage has rebounded to post EPS gains ranging from 50% to 100% over the last five reports. However, growth has been slowing during that period, so see if that trend reverses in Q3.


Analysts expect earnings to rise 33% this year, followed by a 22% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Sales growth accelerated from 16% to 24% in Q2.


RealPage sports solid [**IBD SmartSelect Ratings**](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), including a 98 Composite Rating, earning it the No. 1 rank within the Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry. Plus, fund ownership has been rising in recent quarters and three typically better-performing mutual funds have a position in the stock, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).


2015 IPO **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)), whose parent company EMC was formally acquired by **Dell** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)) earlier this month, are also among the Top 5 stocks in the No. 8-ranked group.


Testing Long Term Resistance
----------------------------


RealPage went public in August 2010, and since the end of 2011, the stock has **[continued to hit resistance](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/)** in the 24 – 29 range.



The stock is again testing that price range as it works on a second-stage flat base with a 26.54 buy point.


RealPage has shown tight weekly closes and its 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio and A Accumulation/Distribution Rating point to demand for shares.


But as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have come under increased selling pressure, RealPage has been testing support at its 10-week moving average.


Look for the stock can stay above that benchmark, and keep a close eye on the general market to see if the current uptrend holds.

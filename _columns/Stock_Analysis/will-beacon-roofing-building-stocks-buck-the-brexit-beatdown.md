Britain's vote to leave the European Union rocked global markets on Friday and cast doubts about worldwide economic growth. But building sector stocks like **Beacon Roofing Supply** ([BECN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BECN)) showed signs of resilience.


Building currently ranks No. 5 among the 33 sectors IBD tracks, and 10 building-related stocks made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-fund-buys-portfolios-cemented-with-u-s-concrete-ulta-beauty/), including **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)), **Universal Forest Products** ([UFPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UFPI)), which was featured in Tuesday's [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-building-sector-stocks-ufpi-us-concrete/), and **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)).


**Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) also made the list and moved higher Friday. Fellow construction products provider **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) also rose.


Strength in the building sector bodes well for industry suppliers and retailers like Beacon Roofing, **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Tile Shop** ([TTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTS)), which broke out Wednesday.


Raising The Roof
----------------


In the latest quarter, Beacon earned 3 cents a share from a year-ago loss of 20 cents, and in the previous two quarters EPS surged 56% and 58%. gains have risen from 8% to 64% to 99% the past three quarters.


The Virginia-based company operates 369 branches throughout 46 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada. Its 99 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 ranking within the IBD's building products industry group, ahead of Lowe's and Tile Shop. Home Depot ranks No. 8.


Testing Ceiling Of Resistance
-----------------------------


Beacon Roofing has consistently found support at the 10-week moving average while forming its current flat base.

Beacon is trading just below a 45.82 entry with its relative strength line moving into new high ground — a sign that the stock is outperforming the general market.


See if the indexes recover from the Brexit scare and if Beacon Roofing Supply can clear its buy point in volume that's at least 40% above average.

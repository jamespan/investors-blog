Although **Air Lease**  ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)) is a relatively young company — it came public in 2010 — it's led by one of the pioneers in the industry.

  

As an Oct. 10 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/100913-674394-air-lease-flying-high-but-not-stock.htm) noted, Steven Udvar-Hazy is credited with inventing the airline leasing business in the early 1970s, when airlines were transitioning from prop planes to jets.

  

As the airlines faced the high costs of adding jets to their fleets, he helped by providing pay-as-you-go leasing.

  

He founded International Lease Finance (ILFC), which grew to be one of the largest in the industry, later selling it to AIG.

  

A few years ago he founded Air Lease, with a management team that includes seasoned executives from ILFC.

  

For airlines, leasing planes rather than buying them directly from aircraft manufacturers helps them keep costs down and keep their fleet flexible.

  

Analysts say Air Lease is growing — they have twice the number of planes on order than are in their current fleet.

  

And they expect sales to climb 30% this year and earnings to grow more than 30%.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Most recently, earnings growth came in at 38%. Sales growth has cooled from its red-hot pace a few years ago and stood at 31% last quarter. 

  

• Air Lease is slated to post their latest quarterly results Nov. 7, so keep an eye out for those.[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-air-lease-corp-cl-a-al.aspx) shows Air Lease carries an 88 Composite Rating, the fourth highest among the 20 stocks in the Commercial Services-Leasing industry group.

  

And the industry is ranked No. 88 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Turning to the MarketSmith daily chart above, Air Lease fell into a long, cup-shaped base in May.

  

It's now moving up the right side of that pattern.

  

To find the ideal buy point in a cup-shaped base, just add 10 cents to the peak on the left side of the base.

  

Watch to see if Air Lease can breakout past that buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average. If it does, it could give investors a chance to get on board.

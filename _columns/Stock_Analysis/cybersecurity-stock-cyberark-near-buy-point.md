The rise of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution guarantees two trends: more sophisticated cyberattacks and more demand for cybersecurity products like those from **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)).

  

That's one reason why the security software industry group, which also includes **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), ranked No. 5 among IBD's 197 groups as of Friday's edition.

  

Based in Israel, CyberArk had its [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) last September and counts 40 of the Fortune 100 and 18 of the top 20 banks as clients.

  

In a recent [interview with IBD](http://news.investors.com/technology-tech-exec-qanda/040715-746738-interview-with-cyberark-ceo-udi-mokady.htm), CEO Udi Mokady said that CyberArk distinguishes itself by focusing on digital vaults inside networks to safeguard privileged accounts, such as those used by network administrators.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

CyberArk has posted two straight quarters of accelerating top- and bottom-line growth, including a 200% rise in earnings in Q4. The company is set to report Q1 numbers May 7.

  

The stock sports a 99 Composite Rating, and its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating means that institutional investors have been picking up shares over the last three months.

  

In IBD's latest special report, [Best Mutual Funds 2015](http://news.investors.com/special-report/746710-best-mutual-funds-2015-first-quarter-performance-report.aspx), CyberArk made the list of [new buys by top-performing stock funds](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/040715-746777-linkedin-among-new-buys-of-top-funds.htm).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public last September, CyberArk formed an [IPO base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/703938-yy-kept-low-profile-but-racked-up-big-gains.htm), then a [double bottom](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/745671-double-bottom-bases-worth-looking-for.htm). It bolted out of the latter base in February on Q4 earnings, rising 62% in just two weeks.

  

It then pulled back but found support at its 10-week line, a sign that big investors were protecting or adding to their positions.

  

The stock is now working on a second-stage formation with a 70.58 buy point. If CyberArk forms a handle, the entry price would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

What do **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)), **Yelp** ([YELP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YELP)) and so-called "unicorns" Uber and Airbnb have in common? They all use the email marketing services of 2017 IPO and potential breakout stock **SendGrid** ([SEND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEND)).




SendGrid had its initial public offering last November, and has since secured a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) screen. Yelp went public in 2012, while [Spotify had its unusual IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-technology-buy-rating-analysts/) — technically called a direct offering — on April 3.


Uber and Airbnb earn the unicorn moniker because they remain privately held companies with a valuation north of $1 billion.


Top 2017 IPOs
-------------


Along with **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), **Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)), **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)), **Casa Systems** ([CASA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CASA)), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and **SailPoint Technologies** ([SAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIL)), SendGrid is among the [top 2017 IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/).


After closing its first day of trading at 18 on Nov. 15, SendGrid rose to a peak of 32.03 in March, a gain of 78%.


SendGrid is currently working on a cup-shaped pattern with a 32.13 entry. See if it goes on to form handle, which would offer an earlier entry. The stock rose 3.7% Thursday, but fell 2.2% on Friday to close at 28.49.


In Q4, the Denver-based company delivered a 400% spike in earnings growth, marking the sixth straight quarter of triple-digit gains. But note that two of those gains were based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed a loss. SendGrid is scheduled to report Q1 numbers on May 1, with analysts expecting a 100% decline in EPS growth. See if SendGrid can top those expectations and/or provide a stronger outlook for the rest of the year.



Floor & Decor, Smart Global and PagSeguro have also made good post-IPO gains, but they have been pulling back recently as the [stock market has come under selling pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dives-10-year-yield-rises-faang-stocks-fall/).


Canada Goose is working on a later-stage base showing a 36.76 buy point. On Friday, the stock rose 1.3% to 36.55 . Along with Casa Systems, PagSeguro and Smart Global, Canada Goose has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of the [best growth stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/best-growth-stocks-buy-watch-ibd-stock-lists/).

How To Buy IPO Stocks
---------------------


New issues can be exciting, but it's important to understand [how to buy IPO stocks](https://shop.investors.com/images/promotional/pdf/IBD_IPO.pdf?src=JA3813&refcode=Infographic_IPOShowdown_IntFB).


As a general rule, it's best to avoid buying any IPO stock right after it goes public. To minimize your risk and still leave plenty of potential upside, wait for a new IPO to form and break out of a chart pattern, such as a [flat base, cup with handle or IPO base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/).


For examples of how and why this approach works, see how the [big-buzz IPOs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-dropbox-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/) from **Faceboo**k ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), and **Square** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S))Q have played out.

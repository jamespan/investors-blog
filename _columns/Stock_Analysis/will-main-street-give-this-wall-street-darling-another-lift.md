 While big bank stocks like **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) stumbled in recent weeks, fellow financial sector name **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)) is testing a new breakout.
The provider of life insurance, mutual funds and annuities re-entered a 84.25-88.46 buy zone Monday, after testing it at the end of last week.


No. 1-Ranked Stock In Industry
------------------------------


Primerica focuses on middle income clients, rather than high net worth households. And Wall Street has shown a keen interest in the company's main street strategy, as evidenced by seven quarters of rising fund ownership and a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


Primerica earns top billing within the life insurance industry group, followed by **Athene Holdings** ([ATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATH)), **Prudential Financial** ([PRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRU)), **Reinsurance Group Of America** ([RGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGA)) and **Fidelity & Guarantee Life** ([FGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FGL)).


Earnings growth has slowed over the last three quarters from 28% to 18%, but analyst estimates for this year and 2018 were recently revised higher to 16% and 11%, respectively.


The Georgia-based company is set to report Q1 numbers May 9.


Is There Life In This Later-Stage Base?
---------------------------------------


Primerica is currently working on a flat base as part of a third-stage formation. While later-stage [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) involve more risk than first- or second-stage consolidations, they can launch successful breakouts.



In Primerica's favor, it has shown tight trading and support at the 10-week line within the base. Plus, its relative strength line was already in new high ground as it broke out Thursday, a sign of market leadership. Volume on the breakout was 32% above average, slightly below the 40%-or-higher spike you look for.


On Friday, the stock fell almost 3% in volume 154% above average, but did find support at the short-term 10-day moving average.


Primerica jumped back into buying range Monday, ending the day at 84.75. Volume had been up sharply in the morning, but ended the day just 8% above average.


Keep in mind that caution — and [sound sell rules](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettingStarted_SellingChecklist.pdf) — are always called for when evaluating a later-stage pattern from a stock set to report soon.

Graphic Packaging Goes Green With Unilever
------------------------------------------


Global in scale, Graphic Packaging is a leading provider of sustainable paper-based packaging solutions for food, beverage, food service and other consumer product companies.


In addition to Unilever, its client roster features many of the world's most widely recognized companies and brands, including **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)), **Altria** ([MO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MO)), **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) and **Nestle** ([NSRGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSRGY)).


On July 28, Unilever announced the global launch of its most [sustainable laundry capsule](https://www.graphicpkg.com/news/unilever-launches-next-generation-laundry-capsule-designed-to-help-decarbonize-laundry-save-energy-and-cut-plastic-packaging/) yet. The new product represents the fastest growing detergent format in many parts of the world. It will launch first in France before rolling out to other markets.


For the first time ever, laundry capsules will be packaged in a groundbreaking plastic-free paperboard box, conceived in partnership with Graphic Packaging. In collaboration with Unilever, the box underwent years of development to lock out moisture more efficiently than current plastic packaging, while preventing capsules from sticking to each other. The box will be easier to open and close, as well as childproof and fully recyclable.


Also last month, Graphic Packaging announced it will launch [ClipCombo](https://www.graphicpkg.com/news/graphic-packaging-international-to-unveil-clipcombo-a-new-approach-to-packaging-machinery-system-development-at-drinktec-2022/) at this year's [drinktec](https://drinktec.com/en/) exhibition. The innovation combines multiple packaging solutions over a modular machinery system.


As the market moves toward cleaner, fiber-based packaging solutions, the company expects the world's leading beverage manufacturers to eagerly welcome the new products. The unveiling takes place in Munich in September.


Graphic Packaging Delivers 108% Q2 Growth
-----------------------------------------


On July 26, Graphic Packaging posted 108% earnings growth, marking a second-straight quarter of acceleration. Over the last three quarters, the company has generated average EPS gains of 69%. Analysts forecast a 68% Q3 EPS increase and an 87% gain for the full year.


Revenue has picked up after several quarters of single-digit sales growth. Over the last three quarters, sales growth has ranged from 20% to 36% on a year-over-year basis.


GPK Stock Crafts Cup With Handle
--------------------------------


As Graphic Packaging manufactures paper cups for your morning coffee, the stock has crafted a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), aiming to serve up a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 23.09.


Downside [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) within the [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) has eased, showing that large investors are sitting tight and holding onto positions. Another positive is how GPK stock has just found support at its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has slipped off the highs struck at the beginning of July. Look for the RS line to turn upward toward a new 52-week high to show increasing market leadership as it nears the entry point.


If Graphic Packaging does break out, look for volume to surge at least 40% above the 50-day average, signaling buyer conviction.

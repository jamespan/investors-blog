Despite a larger-than-expected decline in new home sales in January, homebuilder stocks have been flashing signs of a possible rebound in recent weeks. And **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) may lead the way.


Boosted by a 32% return on equity and three-year annual EPS growth rate of 35%, the Virginia-based building and mortgage banking company also holds the No. 1 ranking among its peers in the homebuilders industry group, ahead of **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)).


Existing home sales in January grew 11% year over year, but new home sales fell to 494,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis.


While that marked a 5.2% year-over-year decline, January 2015 was a particularly strong month, making it a difficult comparison. Also, the numbers for January 2016 are considered preliminary, and when the latest report came out, combined new home sales for October, November and December were revised higher.


According to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at [realtor.com](http://www.realtor.com/news/trends/2016-off-to-good-start-home-sales/), overall “things are looking good” for the 2016 housing market, and he noted “the most encouraging sign: the median price of new homes is finally declining, as a result of the fact that builders are offering more affordable homes.”


Fund Managers Picking Up Shares
-------------------------------


In Q4, NVR’s new home orders rose 14%, pushing revenue growth to 17%.  Earnings-per-share growth jumped from 31% to 37%.


Analysts expect earnings to rise 23% this year, followed by an 18% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised lower, so see if that trend reverses.


NVR earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and its A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates heavy buying by mutual fund managers and other large investors over the last 13 weeks.


NVR Shows Group-Leading Technical Strength
------------------------------------------


Like most stocks, NVR pulled back at the beginning of this year. But it has shown considerably more technical strength than **Pulte Homes** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), D.R. Horton, Lennar and other leading homebuilders.

Also, heavy-volume up weeks in the right side of the base point to institutional buying.


NVR’s Jan. 26 gap up within the base on earnings is another positive sign. While the stock temporarily pulled back after that move, note the big spikes in volume before and on the day of the gap up. In recent days, volume on the upside has again outpaced trading on down days, although the stock was pulling back as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 moved lower Tuesday morning.


The buy point is 1722.05, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if NVR can clear that price on volume at least 40% above average.

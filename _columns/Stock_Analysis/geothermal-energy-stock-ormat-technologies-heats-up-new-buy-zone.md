After securing $100 million in contracts in New Zealand and Indonesia earlier this year, geothermal energy leader **Ormat Technologies** ([ORA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORA)) has generated a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). As of Wednesday's close, ORA stock remains within a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). But the announcement of a secondary offering has the stock selling off ahead of the open.




Ormat currently ranks No. 4 among its industry peers in the alternative energy group, with an 85 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). **NextEra Energy** ([NEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEP)) leads the group with a 95 rating. Other leaders include **Ameresco** ([AMRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMRC)) and **ReNew Power** ([RNW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNW)).


Ormat's A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) shows institutional demand for the geothermal energy play. While Ormat did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-focus-cash-on-these-medical-financial-and-energy-stocks/), 31 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in ORA stock.


Geothermal Energy Heats Up Ormat Technologies
---------------------------------------------


With headquarters in Reno, Nev., Ormat is the only vertically integrated company engaged in geothermal, solar photovoltaic (PV) and recovered energy generation (REG). It aims to accelerate its long-term growth and leadership in the U.S. energy storage market.


Ormat owns, operates, designs, manufactures and sells geothermal and REG power plants. Its [Ormat Energy Converter](https://www.ormat.com/en/company/news/view/?ContentId=8819#:~:text=Ormat%20offers%20unique%20renewable%20power,temperature%20heat%20into%20electrical%20energy.) generates power while converting low-, medium- and high-temperature heat into electricity.


The company has engineered, manufactured and constructed power plants for utilities and developers worldwide. And Ormat has expanded its geothermal and solar generation portfolio globally, with facilities in the U.S., Kenya, Guatemala, Indonesia, Honduras and Guadeloupe.


In August, Ormat signed contracts with [Contact Energy of New Zealand and Sarulla Operations in Indonesia](https://investor.ormat.com/news-events/news/news-details/2022/Ormat-Secures-100-Million-Supply-and-EPC-Contracts-in-New-Zealand-and-Indonesia/default.aspx). Combined revenue for the two contracts is expected to reach $100 million.


As shown in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ormat-technologies-ora.aspx), the energy leader has a spotty track record of earnings and sales growth, generating just 3% growth in EPS and 11% in sales in the last quarter. But analysts forecast a 48% spike in earnings for fiscal 2023.


ORA Stock Tests Buy Zone
------------------------


[ORA stock was featured](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/geothermal-energy-play-heats-up-solar-expansion-and-new-buy-point/) back in July, just before it broke out of a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) base. It ran into resistance and pulled back after gaining around 14%.


The rally retreated, with the stock dropping below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) in September. But ORA stock found support at the 200-day line in October. Buyers returned after the Nov. 2 earnings report, lifting the stock nearly 10% in strong volume. From there, Ormat went on to complete its base and clear a 96.57 buy point.


This chart action marks a first-stage setup because the stock undercut the low in its prior pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


On Wednesday, Ormat Technologies closed 2% above the new buy point. That puts it within the buy zone, which extends 5% above the initial entry price.


In premarket trading, however, the stock is down sharply on news ofÂ  a [secondary offering](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ORA/ormat-announces-pricing-of-upsized-public-offering-of-common-stock-ilswda4api6j.html) of 3.75 million common shares. The offering is expected to close on Nov. 21.

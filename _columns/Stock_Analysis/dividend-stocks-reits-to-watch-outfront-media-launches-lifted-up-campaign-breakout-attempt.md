OutFront Among Top REITs And Dividend Stocks To Watch
-----------------------------------------------------


Based in New York, OutFront is a real estate investment trust (REIT) providing promotional space on out-of-home advertising structures in the U.S. and Canada.


Incorporated in 1938 as Transportation Displays, the company has gone through many corporate changes, including a merger with Viacom Outdoor in 2001 and becoming owned by CBS Outdoor in 2005 after Viacom split from CBS. In 2014, CBS Outdoor changed its name to OutFront Media, an independent company operating as a real estate investment trust. OUT stock began trading that same year.


Today, OutFront Media has one of the largest and most diverse sets of billboard, transit, and mobile assets in North America. Through its ON Smart Media platform, the company is implementing digital technology to fundamentally change the ways advertisers engage audiences on the go.


A member of the property REIT industry group, OutFront earns a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), meaning it's outperforming 94% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Earnings have been rebounding from a decline during the pandemic. In Q3 and Q4, OutFront generated EPS gains of 184% and 86%, respectively. Sales growth has ranged from 38% to 46% over the last three quarters.


OutFront Media pays a dividend yielding 4.3% on an annualized basis, putting among the [best dividend stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-dividend-stocks-to-pick-right-now/).


Breakout Watch: Another Double Bottom In Volatile Market
--------------------------------------------------------


Reflecting the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), [double bottoms](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) tend to form during [market volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/). So it's no surprise that we've seen a lot of double bottoms recently. OutFront Media is another example of a stock forming this [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


A double bottom consists of two legs down, with the second undercutting the first. While bouncing back from that second leg down, OutFront has seen good volume on the upside. And its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has hit a new high.


Having retaken its 10-week moving average, the stock closed the week just 2% shy of a 27.99 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


While the market remains in a [correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/), look for OutFront Media to break out once the stock market gets back to an uptrend.

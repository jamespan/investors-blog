Even as the social distancing trend spreads as a result of the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), people still need to collaborate. With over 150,000 customers in seven offices around the world, **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) helps more than 2.6 million users work together online and in person.




In 2018, Atlassian announced a strategic partnership with **Slack Technologies** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)), with Slack acquiring the intellectual property for Atlassian's Stride and HipChat Cloud collaboration tools.


Atlassian competes with fellow software and cloud companies **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


Based in Australia, Atlassian has earned a spot on the [Global Leaders](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/global-leaders/) screen. Despite the coronavirus stock market crash, Microsoft stock and ServiceNow stock have both held their positions on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) list.

Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)) have reported owning shares in Atlassian stock.

Proving that it's an efficiently run company, Atlassian sports a 22.9% pretax profit margin and a 29.1% return on equity.


Atlassian Stock Near All-Time High In Coronavirus Stock Market
--------------------------------------------------------------


Atlassian has not been unscathed in the coronavirus stock market crash, but the stock has bounced back to within reach of its all-time high.


The December 2015 IPO is now trying to reclaim its 10-week line as it continues to build a new base. In a strong indication of stock market leadership, Atlassian's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has risen into new high ground.


The stock rose nearly 7% Thursday, retaking its 50-day line and closing at the top of its price range. On Friday, Atlassian stock pulled back to its 50-day line, but managed to close above that benchmark in a sign of support.


With Wall Street trying to rebound from the coronavirus crash, now is the time to prepare for a potential [follow-through day to mark a new bull market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/).


Continue to [build your watchlist](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-prepare-watch-list-new-leaders/) and see if Atlassian stock can complete its [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) and launch a new run.


Slack stock, which had its IPO in June 2019, has been shooting higher since falling to a new low earlier in March. On Thursday, Slack jumped 10% in volume well above average. Microsoft stock rose over 6% to close well above its 200-day line. Slack eked out a slight gain Friday, while Microsoft tested its 10-day line.

With Comic-Con coming up this month, pop culture lifestyle brand **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)) is toying with a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). The company's highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) and A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) show the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock is not just about fun and games.




Working with partners like **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) to license properties ranging from "Stranger Things", Fortnite and "Seinfeld", Funko's product line includes vinyl figures, action toys, plush, apparel, board games, housewares and accessories. Funko has also tapped into NFTs (non-fungible tokens) through its [Droppp platform](https://digital.funko.com/).


Funko powers the Loungefly, Funko Games and Digital Pop! brands. It also offers pop culture consumer products through Funko.com, Loungefly.com, FunkoEurope.com and two retail locations in Everett, Washington and Hollywood, California.


With more than 1,000 licensed properties, Funko generated over $1 billion in sales last year. As of the end of last year, Funko has sold more than 750 million pop culture products. The company's products are available in over 25,000 locations, including **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Funko Buys Mondo, Heads To Funkoville
-------------------------------------


Last month, [Funko acquired Mondo](https://investor.funko.com/news-and-events/press-releases/Press-Releases/2022/Funko-Acquires-High-End-Collectible-Company-Mondo/default.aspx). Founded in 2001, Mondo creates vinyl records, posters, soundtracks, toys, apparel, books, games and other collectibles.


From July 21-24, Funko aims to make a splash at the [San Diego Comic-Con with Funkoville](https://investor.funko.com/news-and-events/press-releases/Press-Releases/2022/Funko-Announces-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Takeover-With-Funkoville-an-Immersive-Booth-Experience-for-Fans/default.aspx). Offering an immersive, fan-focused experience, the event gives fans a chance to explore the Funkoville neighborhood, including a movie theater, diner and grocery store.


Funkoville at Comic-Con will also have a Mondo record store and Loungefly boutique. Further fanning the fun, Funko will also host blacklight-themed Fundays.


Funko Flashes Accelerating Growth
---------------------------------


Including its latest report on May 5, Funko has now posted two quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth. Revenue growth has risen from 40% to 63% during that time, while EPS gains have jumped from 26% to 42%.


For the full year, analysts forecast earnings growth of 34%.


Showing that Funko also has fans on Wall Street, FNKO stock made the June list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shun-tech-stocks-scoop-up-medical-defense-oil-stocks/). In [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-funko-inc-cl-a-fnko.aspx), it has a 2.0 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and has delivered six quarters of rising fund ownership.


FNKO Stock Pops Into Buy Zone
-----------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already hitting a new high, Funko has just cleared a 25.18 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The stock remains within the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).


The stock trades well above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/). Plus, while forming its long 57-week base [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/), the 50-day line moved back above the longer-term 200-day line â€” a sign of rebounding technical strength.


As the market indexes try to keep shaking off recent pressure and build on the nascent uptrend, see if Funko continues to build on its new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in strong volume.


The stock has now posted five straight up sessions, four in heavy volume. Funko ended the week 1% above the buy point.

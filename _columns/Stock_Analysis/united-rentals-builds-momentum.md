When Fluor, Bechtel, Turner and scores of other construction companies need heavy equipment at a project, they typically call on **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)).

  

The company is the largest renter of construction and industrial equipment, with 880 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

  

The stock is ranked No. 16 on the IBD 50 list.

  

A number of indicators — such as architectural billings and steel demand — point to a rise in [nonresidential construction](http://news.investors.com/business-inside-real-estate/103014-724252-nonresidential-construction-market-set-for-rebound.htm?p=full), which would boost United Rentals.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Q3 numbers beat estimates.

  

The firm has shown strong earnings growth the past eight quarters, ranging from 21% to 70%. Revenue growth for the same period has been fair, though it briefly slipped into single digits.

  

Earnings are expected to rise 40% in 2014 and 21% in '15. The number of funds owning URI has jumped from 734 to 1057 in the past year, a 44% rise. The stock's 96 Composite Rating is the highest among the lagging 21-member Commercial Services-Leasing group.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a failed breakout in May 2013, the stock enjoyed a successful launch from a base five months later. It then doubled in price in less than 12 months.

  

In September, institutional sellers sent URI crashing below the 10-week and 40-week moving average lines.

  

The Q3 report put the stock back in favor with large investors. United Rentals shares reclaimed the 10- and 40-week lines, forming the right side of a third-stage base. The potential buy point is 119.93.

  

For the past two weeks it's traded in a narrow range, with support at the 10-day line. See if United Rentals can break past resistance on daily volume at least 40% above average.

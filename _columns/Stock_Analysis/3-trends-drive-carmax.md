After stalling out in March, **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) is now trying to rev up a new breakout. IBD recently noted [three reasons to take CarMax on a test drive](http://news.investors.com/business/051415-752629-carmax-should-benefit-from-favorable-trends.htm), including an expanding market, favorable vehicle demographics and falling prices for used cars.

  

The Virginia-based company ended 2014 with 144 car dealerships and plans to open 13 to 16 new locations in each of the next three fiscal years.

  

Rivals in the car dealer industry group include **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)), **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) and **Asbury Automotive Group** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

CarMax has delivered two consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings growth, with a 52% rise in the latest report. The company has posted double-digit revenue gain in seven of the past eight quarters.

  

For fiscal 2016, ending in February, analysts expect earnings to rise 11%, followed by a 13% increase in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher by analysts.

  

CarMax sports a solid 18% return on equity and 96 Composite Rating. Institutional demand for the stock is visible in the B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and steady rise in fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

CarMax is up more than 60% over the past 12 months, but the road has been bumpy.

  

After nearing a new high in February, the stock fell below its 10-week line but didn't stay there long. It gapped up to close 9% higher on April 2 after reporting earnings. Volume was 468% above average.

  

As the general market came under pressure, CarMax pulled back but found support at the 10-week moving average line.

  

It's now working on a [base-on-base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/692345-earlier-stage-bases-tend-to-yield-biggest-gains.htm) formation with a 75.50 buy point.

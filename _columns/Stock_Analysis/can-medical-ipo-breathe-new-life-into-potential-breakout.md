High-profile tech stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) were not the only names on IBD's list of [today's fast-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/). Lesser-known medical stock **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)) also made the grade.
The maker of portable oxygen concentrators for people with chronic respiratory conditions earned a spot on the list with a five-year annual EPS growth rate of 114%.


Mobileye's growth rate slipped from 117% to a still-impressive 111% after reporting 2016 numbers Wednesday, while Facebook saw its earnings growth rate rise to 59% after reporting Feb. 1.


Earnings Exam Ahead
-------------------


Inogen, whose name stands for innovation in oxygen therapy, is scheduled to report Q4 earnings after the close on Tuesday, with analysts expecting EPS to fall 47% and full-year 2016 growth to come in at just 11%. But earnings growth is predicted to rebound to a 26% gain this year.


The 2014 IPO is a fairly thinly traded stock, but signs of institutional demand include a 1.1 up/down volume Ratio, B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a jump in fund ownership last quarter from 316 to 334.


Breathing In On Breakout?
-------------------------


Inogen had a good run in the second half of last year and is now working on a shallow cup-shaped base with a 69.46 entry.



The stock briefly cleared that buy point earlier in the week, but quickly retreated as the indexes also ran into selling pressure.


Volume on the pullback has been relatively light, and the stock has managed to maintain support at its 10-day moving average. Trading rose Friday as the stock showed resilience and reclaimed that short-term benchmark.


With earnings due soon, signs of pressure in the indexes and consensus estimates calling for slowing growth, buying into a breakout attempt now could be risky.


But given its profitable track record and a three-year annual sales growth rate of 41%, Inogen could be one to keep an eye on to see how it reports and how the market reacts.

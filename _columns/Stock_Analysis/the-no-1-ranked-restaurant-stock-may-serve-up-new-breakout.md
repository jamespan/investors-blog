Along with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) made IBD's list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/).
The operator of restaurant/sports bar/arcade combos earned a spot on the list with a 103% five-year annual EPS growth rate, behind Mobileye (117%) and GrubHub (111%).


Facebook saw its annual earnings growth rise to 59% when it reported full-year 2016 numbers on Feb. 1.


Top-Ranked Restaurant Stock
---------------------------


Dave & Buster's, which has 92 locations in 33 states, holds the No. 1 rank among its industry peers with a 95 Composite Rating.


**Jack in the Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)), **Denny's** ([DENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DENN)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Bojangles** ([BOJA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOJA)) round out the top five restaurant stocks.


With a motto of "Eat, Drink, Play, Watch," Dave & Buster's arcade angle appeals to customers looking for more than just a beer, a burger and a ballgame, giving it an edge over rivals like **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)). The company recently added "The Walking Dead" and "Zombie Snatcher" games to its lineup.


Dave & Buster's also appeals to institutional investors, as indicated by eight quarters of rising fund ownership and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


The Dallas-based company generated accelerating growth for both earnings (108%) and sales (19%) in the fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 30.


Game On For Investors?
----------------------


Dave & Buster's skyrocketed nearly 19% on Dec. 7 in massive volume following its stellar Q3 earnings report.



Although it soon pulled back, it held the bulk of those gains and found support at the 50-day line as it built a new base-on-base.


On Thursday, Dave & Buster's jumped into a 58.35-61.27 buy zone, but retreated to close below the entry.


The stock  closed the week with a 1.64% gain, leaving it just under the buy point.


See if Dave & Buster's can decisively punch through the entry in heavy volume next week.

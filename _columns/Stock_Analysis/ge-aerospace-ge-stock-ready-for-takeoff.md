In a reorganization of historic proportions, General Electric has completed its spinoffs of [GE Aerospace](https://www.geaerospace.com/), [GE HealthCare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) and sustainable-energy-focused [GE Vernova](https://www.gevernova.com/). Sometimes called the "crown jewel," **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) has earned that moniker, with shares soaring 358% in two years, from a low in July 2022 until clearing a 170.80 buy point last week. But after testing a new buy zone, stormy weather in the market indexes has created turbulence for [GE stock](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-stock-ge-aerospace-stock/).


**GE HealthCare** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)), which went public at the end of 2022, continues work on a volatile first-stage consolidation. March IPO **GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)) remains on an upward but choppy trajectory but has just sank below its 50-day moving average.




GE Stock Tries To Take Off, But Weather Turns
---------------------------------------------


[GE Aerospace flashed a buy signal](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-earnings-q2-2024-ge-stock-dividend/) after the company reported strong earnings on July 23. But GE stock quickly pulled back below the 170.80 entry it had just cleared.


While still trading just below the buy point, the stock held tough until running into trouble on Friday. GE stock dropped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-aerospace-earnings-q2-2024-ge-stock-dividend/) and the earlier buy point as the Nasdaq continued its descent.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) declined while GE's current base formed, but turned higher as it teased a breakout. The RS line slipped Friday as market troubles spread.


Investors should also note that GE stock's new consolidation is a third-stage base. Such later-stage patterns entail more risk, especially after such a sharp rise.


That said, GE Aerospace now holds the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-ge-aerospace-ge.aspx). And in a sign of solid institutional demand, the stock earns a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), a 1.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and six quarters of rising fund ownership.


GE stock has landed a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) list.


The Aerospace/Defense industry ranks a strong No. 26 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Fellow top-rated peers include **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)) and [Brazilian aircraft maker](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/embraer-erj-stock-evtol-eve-air-mobility-prototype-boeing/) **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)).


GE Aerospace Flies Past Expectations
------------------------------------


In its new life as an independent company, GE Aerospace is a global provider of aviation engines, systems and services, with annual revenue of over $30 billion.


The aviation technology firm designs, develops and manufactures jet engines, components and integrated systems for all types of aircraft. GE Aerospace also makes aero-derivative gas turbines for marine applications. On top of that, GE Aerospace is the leading resource for integrated engine maintenance.


In the second quarter, the company comfortably beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, delivering a 62% spike to $1.20 per share and continuing its streak of accelerating growth. For the full year, analysts forecast a 26% rise to $4.10 a share, followed by a 25% gain in 2025 to $5.12 per share


Q2 revenue slowed 43% to $9.1 billion. The company is expected to continue similar slowdowns over the next three quarters, while maintaining sales above the $9 billion mark in each.

 Leading biotech stock **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) is within striking distance of a breakout after reporting encouraging results in Unveil, "the first prospective, randomized, controlled study to — evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Otezla in patients with moderate plaque psoriasis."
[Celgene's March 5 announcement](http://ir.celgene.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1015864) follows the company's forecast back in January that Otezla would generate revenue of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion this year.


The company delivered total sales of $11.18 billion in 2016, with Revlimid, which treats anemia, myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, accounting for just under $7 billion.


No. 1 Stock Among Highly-Ranked Biotechs
----------------------------------------


Celgene's 98 Composite Rating earns it the top spot in the No. 13-ranked Biomed/Biotech industry group.


**Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)), **Biospecifics Technologies** ([BSTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSTC)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Bioverativ** ([BIVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIVV)) round out the top five stocks.


Celgene has a solid track record of both top and bottom line growth, helped by a 49.5% pretax annual profit margin and 76.2% return on equity.


But the New Jersey-based company carries a 241% debt-to-equity ratio — highest among the five group leaders, including Amgen (101%).


Celgene has posted two straight quarters of rising earnings growth, with EPS gains ranging from 17% to 37% over the last eight reports.


Sales growth has ranged from 16% to 28% during the same time, with average annual growth of 20% over the last three years.


Institutional demand for shares is reflected in the stock's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio and four straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Putting Long-Term Resistance On Trial
-------------------------------------


Since March 2015, Celgene has ran into resistance around the 130 mark. The [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) member briefly punched through that ceiling in July of that year before beginning an extended slump and has to reclaim that price.


The stock briefly soared higher after the election, as investors felt Donald Trump would be less hostile to biotech and pharmaceutical companies than Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.


But Celgene has been consolidating since then in a first-stage base, generally finding support along its 10-week line.


The stock rose nearly 5% last week in rising and above-average volume, pushing it closer to a 127.10 buy point. Investors could also use a point of resistance the stock hit on March to create a 124.89 entry.


Note that the Relative Strength line remains below new high ground. Look for that line to trend higher to show market leadership as Celgene tries to punch through resistance and launch a new run in heavy volume.


On Tuesday, the stock was down over 1% in below-average, but rising trade. Celgene recovered enough to close above its 10-day line, and again found support on Wednesday in light volume.


Look for the stock to clear the entry in trading at least 40% higher than normal.


*Update*: After clearing the 124.89 buy point on Thursday in volume 34% above average, Celgene pulled back Friday to close below that entry but found support at its 10-day line. Trading was 21% higher than normal.

With shootings by police and attacks on law enforcement both on the rise, investors are watching what impact that unrest is having on leading gun makers **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)), **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) and **Taser** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)).


Sturm Ruger reports Q2 earnings after the close today, while stun gun and body camera leader [Taser follows suit on Thursday](https://www.investors.com/videos/investing-lessons-and-stories-from-ibd-found-bill-oneil/).


On June 16, Smith & Wesson reported numbers for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, which ended April 30. While earnings growth slowed from 195% to 47%, that still topped earnings estimates by over 22%.


Trying To Shoot Out Of Bases
----------------------------


While Taser broke out in May and has been moving steadily higher since then, Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger are testing new buy points.


On Monday, Sturm Ruger closed just below a 70.40 entry, as volume rose 27% above average. The stock sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


Smith & Wesson kicked off the week, retaking its prior entry on Monday and ending the day within a 29.85-31.34 buy zone.


While volume for the day was below average, the stock has shown signs of institutional demand, including an A Acc/Dis Rating and 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio. Smith & Wesson also made IBD's most recent list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/what-top-mutual-funds-are-buying-netease-coresite-dave-busters/).


Taking A Knife To A Gun Fight?
------------------------------


To help reduce its reliance on cyclical gun sales, the Massachusetts-based company acquired Taylor Brands, a designer and distributor of knives and specialty tools. The deal was completed on Aug. 1.


On July 25, Smith & Wesson also announced it will buy Crimson Trace, an industry leader in laser sighting systems and tactical lighting for firearms.


Boosted by average EPS growth of 140% over the last three quarters, Smith & Wesson sports a 97 Composite Rating. It ranks No. 2 within its industry group, behind **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), but ahead of **Allegion** ([ALLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLE)), Sturm Ruger and Taser.

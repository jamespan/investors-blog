Legendary investor Warren Buffett is famous for focusing on well-run, potentially undervalued companies. And while the **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) CEO isn’t known as a big investor in tech stocks, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is one name that makes a screen based on Buffett’s stock-picking criteria.


Created by IBD sister firm [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), the [Warren Buffett Stock Screen](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/warren-buffett-stock-screen-which-names-make-the-list/) reflects the Oracle of Omaha’s emphasis on a company’s management quality, long-term track record and growth prospects. The list identifies stocks with strong annual and quarterly earnings-per-share gains, a solid return on equity, profit margins equal to or greater than the industry average and other key fundamental performance metrics.


Profit Margins: Facebook Vs. Social Rivals
------------------------------------------


Facebook’s rising earnings and sales growth in recent quarters and five-year 51% annual EPS growth rate (and three-year rate of 71%) pass Buffett’s performance criteria.


The company's 55.6% annual pretax profit margin also earns high marks, far surpassing industry group peers **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) (33%), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) (17.6%) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) (7.7%).


That profitability has allowed CEO Mark Zuckerberg to acquire new social platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram, develop new products such as the Messenger app, and dive into virtual reality with its purchase of Oculus VR.


What Moving Averages Say About Facebook's Stock
-----------------------------------------------


While the Silicon Valley-based firm has impressive fundamentals and over 1.55 billion monthly active users on the Facebook platform alone, the market is in a correction and the stock is currently showing technical weakness, meaning now is not an ideal time to buy.

But the chart offers important lessons on how to evaluate your stocks in a down market.


First, look for signs of support and resistance at key moving averages. Facebook kicked off 2016 by falling below the 10-week line, but found support at its second line of defense, the 40-week moving average.


The stock bolted higher last month on earnings, then quickly pulled back as the general market came under selling pressure. But again, large investors stepped in to support the stock and keep it above the 40-week line.


Also look for stocks to find support around prior buy points. As Facebook pulled back, it managed to stay above its earlier 96.59 entry.


The stock is now again testing its 10-week line. If it continues to show resilience and can clear resistance at that moving average, the Sultan of Social Media may do the Oracle of Omaha proud and take off when a new uptrend begins.

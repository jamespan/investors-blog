As **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) moves just out of buy range, fellow IBD 50 member and building products manufacturer **PGT Innovations** ([PGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGTI)) may be getting ready to become the next breakout stock.

Accelerating Sales & Earnings Growth
------------------------------------


PGT Innovations has posted three straight quarters of rising top- and bottom-line growth. As quarterly earnings went from a 16% decline in Q3 to a 171% gain in the latest report, sales growth has risen from a 2% drop to a 24% increase.


Analysts expect a 52% EPS increase this year, followed by a 15% gain in 2019. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Signs of institutional demand for shares in PGT include a moderately strong B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 2.1 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership


Next IBD 50 Breakout Stock?
---------------------------


PGT is working on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 22.07 buy point. The pattern is part of a second-stage base-on-base. Note how the bottom of the current flat base formed right around the 19.70 entry in the prior pattern — a healthy sign of support.


As you like to see in the lead-up to a potential breakout, PGT's relative strength line is right around new high ground. On Monday, the stock rose 1.7% to 21.20. In Tuesday's shortened trading session, the stock rose 1.7% to 21.55, bringing it within 2% of the buy point.


Meanwhile Trex has climbed out of a 60.30 to 63.32 buy zone. The stock gained over 3% Monday, but in light volume. It added another 0.8% on Tuesday.

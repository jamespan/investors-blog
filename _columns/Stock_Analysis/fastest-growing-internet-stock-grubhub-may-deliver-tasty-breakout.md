With the No. 1 ranking in the internet-content group and a spot on IBD's list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/), **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) is near a potential buy zone with Q4 earnings due before Wednesday's market open.
The 2014 IPO stock earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, putting it ahead of other top internet names, including **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


Accelerating Growth
-------------------


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) member has posted two straight quarters of rising earnings and sales growth.


Longer term, GrubHub has delivered a five-year EPS growth rate of 111%, putting it just behind **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)) (121%), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) (117%) and **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)) (114%) among the fastest-growing stocks, and ahead of **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)).


A 33.1% annual pretax profit margin and 18.5% return on equity help drive GrubHub's strong profit gains.


Although Facebook may start moving more aggressively into the Chicago-based company's turf with its Marketplace platform and nascent food-ordering service, GrubHub remains the nation's leading online and mobile food ordering service, connecting nearly 8 million hungry diners with over 45,000 restaurants in more than 1,100 cities.


One Breakout, Coming Up?
------------------------


GrubHub has shown signs of institutional demand in the right side of its base, including a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


GrubHub also made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/grubhub-delivers-food-profit-for-top-funds/), with 20 mutual funds investing approximately $27 million over the last three months.



On Thursday, GrubHub briefly cleared a 42.13 buy point, but pulled back to close lower in rising and above-average volume. The stock has been testing support at its 10-day moving average line, but look for volume on the downside to lighten up to show that large investors are not selling aggressively.


Also note that it's risky to buy a stock just before earnings, and GrubHub could swing sharply up or down depending on if it delivers a three-peat in terms of accelerating growth Wednesday.

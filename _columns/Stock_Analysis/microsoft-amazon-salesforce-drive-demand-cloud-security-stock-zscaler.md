How is the spread of cloud-based services from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) helping 2018 IPO **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS))? It's boosting demand for Zscaler's cloud security platform.




As noted in IBD's [profile of Zscaler](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/zscaler-stock-sd-wan-website-security/), fewer large companies are purchasing software licenses for on-site data centers. Instead, they're relying on cloud-based applications and SaaS (software-as-a-service) to provide employees and customers anytime, anywhere access to an ever-growing range of apps and tools.


This rise of SaaS offerings from cloud giants like Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Salesforce requires a new approach to protecting corporate networks that's focused on internet applications, rather than traditional data centers.


Many enterprises are also switching to so-called software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN), which often taps into internet bandwidth, giving Zscaler and other [cloud-based cybersecurity stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) new growth opportunities in the web security gateway market.

Fast-Growing Cloud Security Stock
---------------------------------


Zscaler's cloud security platform is used in over 185 countries, helping protect thousands of customers from cyberattacks and data loss.


Over the last three years, the Silicon Valley-based company has generated average annual sales growth of 56%. Zscaler has posted two quarters of triple-digit EPS growth, including a 280% rise for its fiscal 2019 second quarter (ended Jan. 31). But note that the gains in both of those reports are based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed losses. Zscaler has not yet announced the date of its next earnings report.


Institutional investors have taken note of Zscaler's rapid growth and the potential of its cloud security industry. The stock has seen four quarters of rising fund ownership, and it sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.6 up/down volume ratio.


After 50% Run, Is Zscaler Poised To Pop Again?
----------------------------------------------


Zscaler went public in March 2018. On Jan. 18, 2019, it was added to the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](http://The company also has 0% debt-to-equity ratio.) while forming a new base. A week later it began launching a new climb, rising over 50% from a 45.97 entry in just 10 weeks. Along the way, it gapped up to a nearly 22% gain on March 1, the day after reporting fiscal Q2 earnings. Volume on the day was 444% above average.


Zscaler stock began pulling back in early April — not unusual after a 50%-plus rise in such a short amount of time. In a sign of strength, the stock found [support at its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and bounded off it. Zscaler is now testing that benchmark line once more as it works on the fifth week of a possible new base.


The stock has many of the winning traits you look for when searching for the [best stocks to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/). With a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), it's a leading stock in a leading industry group. Its cybersecurity software industry ranks No. 6 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. And as you like to see, the group features several highly rated, top-performing stocks, including **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).


Zscaler has earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), while Palo Alto Networks is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), all of which have a track record of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/). Amazon and Salesforce are both on the IBD Big Cap 20.


On Friday, Zscaler fell below its 10-day moving average in the morning, but bounced back to close above it with a 2.6% gain. See if the stock can build on that strong close with a continued rise next week.

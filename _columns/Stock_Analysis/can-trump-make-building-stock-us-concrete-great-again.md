If Donald Trump can implement his plan to rebuild airports, bridges and other parts of America's aging infrastructure, it could make building stocks like **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) great again. But that remains a big "if."









 
 
 Like with the president's calls to repeal and replace ObamaCare and enact major tax reform, his $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan has run into resistance, with many observers doubting it will get through Congress this year.
But according to [FMI's 2017 Construction Outlook](https://www.fminet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Outlook_2017Q2_FINAL.pdf), "while there is some uncertainty as to growth in 2018 and beyond, it appears that the (heavy construction) industry will continue to see slow but solid growth with hot spots and cooling local markets around the country."


Concrete Profits
----------------


Based in Texas, U.S. Concrete serves major construction markets across the U.S. in two business segments: ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products.


Boosted by a 25% return on equity, the company generated EPS gains of 77% and 76% in Q1 and Q2, respectively.


Revenue gains have increased for three straight quarters, coming in at 24% in Q2, helping earn the stock an A for its [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE.


U.S. Concrete holds the No. 1 rank within the Buillding-Cement/Concrete/Aggregate industry group, ahead of **United States Lime & Minerals** ([USLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USLM)), **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)), **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) and **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)).


Institutional demand for U.S. Concrete is reflected in its B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/institutional-buying-accumulation-in-a-base/) and three quarters of rising fund ownership. Fifty-two mutual funds with an A or A+ rating have reported a position in the stock.


Trump Bump — Or Speed Bump — Ahead?
-----------------------------------


After an initial jump on Trump's election win at the end of last year, U.S. Concrete began to consolidate. Going back to April of last year, the stock continued to hit resistance around 70, but finally punched through that resistance in June on a [breakout from a flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/).



U.S. Concrete is now working on another flat base and has managed to stay above that former area of resistance, which may mean it's turning that former ceiling into a floor of support.


But U.S. Concrete currently faces a test at its 10-week moving average. In recent days, the stock has been trading below that benchmark line, and was moving lower again Thursday. Keep a close eye on the volume since that will indicate how serious or moderate the selling is. For now, volume is on pace to come in below average for the week.


Also continue to track progress on Trump's infrastructure spending plan, and see if U.S. Concrete can retake the 10-week line and push through the 80.55 entry in volume at least 40% above average.

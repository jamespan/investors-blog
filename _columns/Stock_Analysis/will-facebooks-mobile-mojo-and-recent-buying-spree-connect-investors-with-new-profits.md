Facebook has been on a buying spree, picking up Instagram in 2012 and adding mobile-messaging firm WhatsApp and virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR in 2014.

  

But in terms of increasing current revenue, perhaps the social media giant's most important move has been its successful shift toward capturing mobile ad dollars.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

**Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) mobile mojo has helped drive sales growth, ranging from 53% to 72% over the past five quarters. Earnings also have surged, with triple-digit gains in three of the past four quarters.

  

For 2014, analysts expect EPS growth of 84%, followed by a 25% gain in 2015.

  

The company sports a 16% return on equity and earns an A for its SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE. A big driver of that score is Facebook's stellar annual pre-tax profit margin of 47.7%.

  

Institutional investors have taken note, as reflected in Facebook's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and the rising number of funds that own the stock. Last quarter, 125 new funds reported taking a position in Facebook.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After the infamous free fall following its 2012 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) , Facebook found its footing and broke out of a double bottom in July 2013.

  

It broke out of a third-stage cup-with-handle a year later, then gapped higher on July 24 after reporting Q2 numbers. But the stock failed to rise at least 20% before starting to form another consolidation, which means that its current flat base is also third stage.

  

On Sept. 2, Facebook broke past a 76.09 early entry, but volume was light. On Wednesday, it also moved above the more traditional 76.84 buy point during the day but reversed to close below it. The stock ended the week just above the 76.84 buy point.

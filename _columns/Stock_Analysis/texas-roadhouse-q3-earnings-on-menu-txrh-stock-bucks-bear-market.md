While the [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/) continues to scar the indexes, **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) aims to carve out a fresh [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-using-flat-base-chart-pattern/). Serving up a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) — trailing only **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-texas-roadhouse-inc-txrh.aspx) among restaurant stocks — TXRH stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has already hit a new high as it takes a tentative bite at a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




To be sure, current market conditions and the upcoming Q3 earnings season call for a Texas-size dose of caution. But Texas Roadhouse is proving it can take the heat as it nears the celebration of its 30th anniversary in 2023.


The company has shown signs of demand among investors.


Although not joining **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) and **Nathan's Famous** ([NATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NATH)) on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-huge-sums-in-24-stocks-including-vertex-lilly-enphase/), 34 funds with an "A+" rating have reported a position in TXRH stock. It sports a "B+" [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), which points to solid buying by large investors over the last 13 weeks.


As a whole, the restaurant industry ranks a solid No. 33 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. CMG stock leads with a 97 Composite Rating.


Earnings On The Menu For Texas Roadhouse
----------------------------------------


Despite its name, Texas Roadhouse is actually headquartered in Kentucky. Operating primarily in the casual dining segment, it has over 680 locations in 49 states and 10 foreign countries.


While recent quarterly earnings growth has fluctuated widely, Texas Roadhouse has posted average EPS growth of 27% over the last three years.


In Q2, the company generated earnings of $1.07 per share, a 1% slowdown compared to the prior-year quarter. Analysts forecast a rebound to 17% growth for Q3 and 12% for the full year.


Texas Roadhouse generated 14% sales growth in Q2, slightly above its 13% average annual growth over the last three years. The company earns an "A" SMR Rating, which track sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


The purveyor of hearty fare like [Texas Size Combos and Fall-Off-The-Bone Ribs](https://www.texasroadhouse.com/global-menu) is scheduled to report Q3 earnings after the close on Oct. 27.


TXRH Stock Eyes Tasty Buy Point In Sour Market
----------------------------------------------


With its market-leading [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/), Texas Roadhouse has reclaimed its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/). At the same time, its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) is attempting to retake its longer-term 50-day line.


On Wednesday, TXRH stock jumped nearly 3% in heavy and rising volume. Trade was double its daily average. Texas Roadhouse closed just 1% shy of a 95.52 entry in a first-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


But after Texas Roadhouse briefly clearing that buy point early Friday, the stock reversed to fall back below it on Friday.


After breaking out last month, industry peer Chipotle Mexican Grill has dropped below its 50-day moving average but found support at its 200-day line, the second line of defense.


Nathan's Famous has also pulled back from a September breakout and failed to hold support at its 50-day line on Friday. Wingstop needs to get back above its 10-week line before it can take flight.

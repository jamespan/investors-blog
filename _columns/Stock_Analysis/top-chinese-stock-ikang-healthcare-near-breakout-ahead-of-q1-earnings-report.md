As ObamaCare and aging baby boomers increase demand for health care services in the U.S., the medical needs of China's population are also on the rise. And that's translating into robust growth for **iKang Healthcare Group** ([KANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KANG)).

  

The Beijing-based company is said to be China's largest provider of private preventive healthcare services, with an estimated market share of almost 14% in revenue.

  

As noted in [Sector Leaders Review](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/060115-755143-china-healthcare-stock-ikang-near-buy-point.htm), iKang operates 59 medical centers covering 16 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The company has been generating healthy sales growth, ranging from 43% to 96% over the last six quarters. Earnings have risen between 30% and 60% in the last three reports.

  

IKang is set to report Q1 numbers on June 8.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to jump 85%, followed by a 34% increase in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised downward, so see if that trend reverses.

  

Helped by a 69% annual EPS growth rate, iKang earns a solid 97 Composite Rating. Its best possible A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio point to solid institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

IKang [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in April 2014. It formed a base and broke out two months later, rising over 30% in just 12 weeks.

  

The stock then began forming its current 40-week consolidation, with a 22.96 buy point, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

Within the base, iKang showed three weeks of tight price closes right along the 10-week line, followed by a nearly 18% gain last week.

  

Also note how the stock's volume has been above average in the right side of the base and the Relative Strength line has been trending higher and nearing new high ground ahead of a potential breakout.

  

But keep in mind that iKang is set to release earnings on June 8, and buying just before an earnings report entails more risk.

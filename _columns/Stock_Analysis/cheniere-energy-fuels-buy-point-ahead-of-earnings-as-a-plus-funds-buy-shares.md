Liquid natural gas provider **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) lost money in 2020 and 2021, but the Russia-Ukraine war has greatly improved the sales outlook of this Houston-based company. Russian throttling of natural gas is forcing Europe to look across the Atlantic to replace the lost fuel and save its citizens from a cold winter.


This dramatic shift in supply and demand should translate into much stronger sales from now into 2023, and perhaps longer. Institutions have taken note, with 126 A+ rated funds owning LNG stock. This has propelled relative strength, lifting shares toward a new [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Given the bullish scenario, investors have high hopes Cheniere will meet or beat Q2 estimates for a profit of $3.47 per share on Aug. 4.




The lack of earnings is still hurting Cheniere's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), which is a middling 72.


However, its Oil & Gas Transportation/Pipeline [industry group](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) ranks a strong No. 11 among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. Higher-rated group leaders include **Rattler Midstream** ([RTLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTLR)) and **Western Midstream Partners** ([WES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WES)) both hold a lofty 98 Composite Rating. **DCP Midstream** ([DCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DCP)) is also top sector play, with a Composite Rating of 97.


While Cheniere Energy did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-medical-sector-leads-new-buys-by-top-funds-while-big-mac-joins-big-oil/), the broad fund support is impressive. The company has also earned a spot on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/) as it shows strength ahead of earnings.

Cheniere Energy Signs Long-Term Thailand And China Contracts
------------------------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Houston, Cheniere Energy is the U.S.' leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). It also has offices in London, Singapore, Beijing, Tokyo and Washington, D.C.


As a full-service LNG provider, operations include procurement, transportation, liquefaction, vessel chartering and delivery. In addition, Cheniere Energy is pursuing liquefaction expansion opportunities and other projects along the LNG value chain.


This month, Cheniere signed two long-term contracts for operations in Thailand and China. It entered into a long-term sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with [PTT Global LNG Co.](https://lngir.cheniere.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/256/cheniere-and-ptt-sign-long-term-lng-sale-and-purchase), Thailand's largest state-owned, multinational energy company. The 20-year agreement, beginning in 2026, will be managed by Cheniere's wholly owned subsidiary, Corpus Christi Liquefaction.


Subsidiary Cheniere Marketing also entered into a LNG SPA with a subsidiary of [PetroChina](https://lngir.cheniere.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/255/cheniere-and-petrochina-sign-long-term-lng-sale-and). Deliveries under the deal will begin in 2026 and run through 2050.


Cheniere Energy sales growth has accelerated from 119% in Q3 2021 to 142% in Q1 of this year. As reported by [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-growing-thirst-for-american-gas-tests-u-s-ability-to-meet-demand-11658494858), LNG imports from the U.S. to Europe more than doubled from March to June, underpinning those increases.


However, earnings have proved more elusive, with the company failing to produce profits in recent quarters. While Cheniere's upcoming earnings report will be based on year-over-year comparisons that show a loss, analysts are looking for a 368% EPS gain. Expectations are high, and a strong report may spark the beginning of multiquarter profitability.


Cheniere Energy has raised its 2022 profit forecast amid spiking demand. It also boosted full-year adjusted core earnings estimates to the $8.2 billion-$8.7 billion range, up from $7 billion-$7.5 billion. Estimates are also benefiting from the ramp-up of a new train at Sabine Pass plant and sustained higher LNG margins.


LNG Stock Enters Buy Zone
-------------------------


Cheniere Energy rejoins IBD Leaderboard after crossing a [trendline entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has hit a new 52-week high, while LNG stock has cleared a 146.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) pattern, The [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) extends to 153.77.


In a sign of rebounding technical strength, the shorter-term [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has moved back above the longer-term [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/).


With earnings due next week, a positive report could propel a breakout in heavy volume.


LNG stock showed resilience Thursday, coming off its lows for the day to close just fractionally down. Upside volume picked up in the final hour of trading. Cheniere Energy rose  again Friday and remains in buy zone.

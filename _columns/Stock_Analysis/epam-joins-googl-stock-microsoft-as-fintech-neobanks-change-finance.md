**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are not the only top tech stocks on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). Engineering and IT powerhouse **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) also makes this elite list. And like [MSFT stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/), [GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) and ADBE stock, Epam is trying to engineer a renewed climb.




To make the IBD Long-Term Leaders list, each member must have a solid track record of stable earnings growth. Unlike the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), where a high number is desirable, the lower the Earnings Stability Factor, the more stable the earnings.


Epam and Adobe lead this list of growth stocks with a three-year EPS stability score of 2. That tops the scores for both [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) giants Microsoft (3) and Alphabet (11).


In terms of Composite Rating, Epam and Alphabet both sport the highest-possible 99 rating, meaning they're outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). With a 98 Composite Rating, Microsoft also earns high marks in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), while Adobe merits a 92 rating.


Epam Partners With Google To Accelerate Database Migrations
-----------------------------------------------------------


Last month, Epam held a webinar on how it is [partnering with Google](https://www.epam.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/2021/accelerate-google-cloud-database-migration-assessments-with-migvisor) to help organizations accelerate their database migrations to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using [migVisor for GCP](https://www.migvisor.com/), an automated database migration assessment tool.


Epam provided details on how to move legacy **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) and SQL Server Databases to Google-based Cloud SQL. With the pandemic driving the need for companies to adopt cloud modernization solutions, it also outlined how Epam handles customer care throughout the migration journey.


Fintech, Neobanks Alter Financial Landscape, Driving Demand For Epam
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Pennsylvania, Epam operates in a wide range of countries and industries. It serves clients in more than 35 countries across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.


As it leverages its software engineering expertise, Epam has become a global product development, digital platform engineering, and top digital and product design agency.


One industry of focus — among many — is financial technology, or fintech.


In its recently released [Consumer Banking Report 2020](https://www.epam.com/2021-banking-report?utm_source=pr-newswire&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=future-of-banking&utm_term=consumer-banking-report-2021), Epam offers insights into the evolving changes in customer behavior since the pandemic. The report highlights how the financial landscape has changed with advances in fintech and the rise of [neobanks](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/what-is-a-neobank/) — fintech companies that offer apps, software and other technologies to facilitate mobile and online banking.


Among other topics, the report takes an in-depth look at how younger consumers navigate their finances and what such trends might mean for the future of banking.


Top Funds Buy Into Epam Stock
-----------------------------


Epam joins Alphabet on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-googl-stock-tech-stocks-but-stock-market-correction-hits/). In a further sign of demand, 169 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Epam.


With earnings due Nov. 4, Epam is working on a later-stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) with a 648.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has hit a new high ahead of a potential breakout. Epam stock rose just under 5% for the week, closing just shy of the buy point.


MSFT stock is in a buy zone, while GOOGL stock fell below its 50-day line, but came off its lows as it continues to build a flat base.

While **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has already toppled **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in terms of market capitalization weighting on the Nasdaq, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) continues to reign supreme — for now. Boosted by fresh updates to the iPhone and iPad mini, [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-buy-now-aapl-stock/) looks to launch a new breakout ahead of earnings next week despite a [new analyst downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-downgraded-to-sell-before-fiscal-q4-report/).


Meanwhile, Nvidia aims to usurp that crown as it teases a new buy point and all-time high of its own. And fellow [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) Microsoft — which analysts say could be [worth more than Nvidia in 2025](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-company-will-be-worth-more-than-nvidia-next-year-analysts/) — could also pull off a market-cap coup as it sets up a potential new breakout.




Apple Stock Vs. Nvidia And Microsoft
------------------------------------


As of Thursday's close, Apple accounted for 9.9% of the Nasdaq, with [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/) hot on its heels at 9.7%. In third place comes Microsoft, accounting for 8.9% of the index.


But Apple's lead in the market-cap race is under threat. The king of Cupertino maintained a slight edge Friday, closing the week valued at $3.52 trillion. Nvidia closed with a market cap of $3.47 trillion. Microsoft's value stands at $3.18 trillion.


The other Magnificent Seven stocks fall well short of the Big Three. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) at 5.6%, and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), with 5.5% weighting, are virtually tied for fourth place. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) has 4% weighting while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) jumped to 2.3% after posting a [surprise Q3 earnings gain](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-earnings-q3-elon-musk/).

Apple Earnings In Focus: Trick Or Treat Ahead?
----------------------------------------------


While Tesla just reported and Nvidia isn't due until Nov. 20, Apple joins the other Mag 7 names on deck for a slew of reports next week.


Apple, which just released the new iPad mini, reports on Halloween, the same day as Amazon.


Analysts expect Apple to deliver $94.4 billion in revenue, which would mark a 5% year-over-year gain. Earnings for the September quarter are expected to increase 9% to $1.59 per share. For the full year, Wall Street forecasts 9% earnings growth to $6.71 per share, followed by a 10% rise to $7.41 per share in 2025.


On Oct. 18, Apple got an [upbeat iPhone sales report from China](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-rises-on-china-iphone-sales-report/), the stock continues to show signs of demand. While sporting a [93 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-aapl.aspx), Apple stock has encountered some pressure. Its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) has slipped to a C+ and its [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) has dropped below 1.0 to 0.9.


Before Apple and Amazon report on Oct. 31, Alphabet will unveil its quarterly numbers on Oct. 29, followed by Microsoft and Meta on Oct. 30.


Apple Stock Holds Support, Hopes For Breakout
---------------------------------------------


While trading well above its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and bouncing off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), Apple continues work on an early stage [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). The buy point is 237.23.


The relative strength line has moved mostly sideways while Apple stock formed the new base. Look for the RS line to trend higher as the potential breakout nears.


With an eye on swiping Apple's market-cap crown, Nvidia closed out a fifth straight up week as it teased a record high. The stock remains in buy range after clearing a 140.74 entry on Oct. 21.


Microsoft has reclaimed its 50-day benchmark as it continues to work on a new base ahead of earnings.

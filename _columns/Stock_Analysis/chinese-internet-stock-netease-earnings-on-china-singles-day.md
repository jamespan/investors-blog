As e-commerce giants **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) get ready for Singles Day — China's largest online shopping event of the year, on Nov. 11 — fellow Chinese Internet stock **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) is set to release its latest earnings report the same day.

  

The [IBD 50 stock](http://news.investors.com/technology/110715-779633-ibd-fifty-netease-poised-for-holiday-growth.htm) is a leading provider of online gaming, including "World of Warcraft," licensed from **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), and the recently released "Speedy Ninja," featuring renowned electronic dance music artist Steve Aoki.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

NetEase has posted five consecutive quarters of rising sales growth and two quarters in a row of increasing earnings gains.

  

Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

Overall, NetEase earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and the No. 1 spot within the Computer-Software — Gaming industry group, ahead of **Take-Two Interactive Software** ([TTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTWO)) and Activision Blizzard. The group ranks No. 18 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since finding a bottom at the end of 2012, the stock has been trending higher, but it has not been a smooth ride.

  

NetEase [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/getting-started-counting-bases/) in March, when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.

  

The stock is now working on a second-stage base that showed a lot of volatility in the left side of the consolidation.

  

But trading has been healthier on the right side of the base, with the stock posting six up weeks in a row.

  

Note how the closes have been at or near the top of the price range and how the 10-week line has crossed back above the 40-week moving average.

  

Also, the Relative Strength line has been nearing new high ground.

  

The buy point is 154.98, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

See if NetEase can clear that price on volume at least 40% above average.

  

But keep in mind that it's risky to buy just before a company reports, so see what kind of numbers NetEase delivers on Nov. 11 and how the market reacts.

**Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) pioneered computer-aided-design (CAD) software in the 1980s, and is now trying to design a [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) to launch a new breakout move. But will the market cooperate?


The San Rafael, Calif.-based based software firm has seen a strong rebound in earnings over the last two quarters. For the second quarter (ended July 31) of fiscal 2019, Autodesk posted a 273% rise in earnings. That followed a 138% spike in fiscal Q1. While both of those gains are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed a loss, the company is headed in the right direction. Revenue growth has also been turning around, rising from a 9% decline in Q2 of fiscal 2018 to a 22% gain in the second quarter of the current fiscal year.


Analysts expect Autodesk to post 325% earnings growth for fiscal Q3, which ends Oct. 31. But it also would be a profit vs. a year-ago loss. On Sept. 20, Autodesk got a [bullish price-target hike](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autodesk-stock-bullish-analyst-report/) from a Wall Street analyst, from 165 to 180.

Autodesk Rebound Expected To Continue
-------------------------------------


Autodesk's rebound is a work in progress. At 83, its Composite Rating is below the 95 or higher rating that earns a passing grade in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2354661). But that's up from a 68 back in July. While its [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity, is a lowly E, institutional investors have taken note of the emerging turnaround.


The stock has a 1.1 up/down volume ratio and has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating stands at a mediocre C-, so look for that to improve to a B or better.


As you like to see, some of the best mutual funds have picked up shares, including Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and 174 other funds with an A+ rating.


Autodesk Stock May Design New Breakout
--------------------------------------


Autodesk gapped up to gain over 15% on Aug. 24 after reporting earnings. Volume was 351% higher than normal. The stock has managed to hold on to the bulk of those gains while building a new flat base as part of a base-on-base formation.


The [relative strength line](https://investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/technical-analysis/relative-strength-line-910) is within striking distance of a new 52-week high, and Autodesk has successfully tested support at its 10-week moving average within the base. See if Autodesk can punch through the 160.04 buy point in volume at least 40% above average. It closed the week 5% below that entry.


But also keep a close eye on the general market. October is known as a volatile month for the stock market, and it's proving that again this year. Thursday's sharp sell-off changed the market outlook to "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)," meaning it's a time to be very cautious about making any new buys.

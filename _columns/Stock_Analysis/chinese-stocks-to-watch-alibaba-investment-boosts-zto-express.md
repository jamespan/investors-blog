On May 29, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and Cainiao Network announced a $1.4 billion investment in fellow Chinese stock **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)). After surging on that news, ZTO jumped into a new buy zone.




In exchange for the investment, Alibaba and Cainiao picked up an approximately 10% equity stake in the express delivery firm. The move expands Alibaba's push for what it calls "new retail" — the integration of online and offline e-commerce. Cainiao is a leading smart logistics network and has a longstanding collaboration with ZTO Express.


ZTO offers line-haul, last-mile, express delivery, in-city delivery, fulfillment and warehousing services across China.

Chinese Stocks To Watch: ZTO Holds No. 1 Ranking
------------------------------------------------


With a 97 Composite Rating, ZTO holds the [No. 1 ranking](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-zto-express-ads-cl-a-zto.aspx) within the Transporation-Logistics industry group. **Expeditors International** ([EXPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPD)) holds the No. 2 spot with a 92 rating. Alibaba's highest-possible 99 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 ranking among internet retail stocks.


The [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) sports a solid three-year annual earnings growth rate of 67%. It had its IPO in October 2016. The company's 98 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) means it's outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of annual and quarterly earnings growth.


ZTO has delivered sales growth ranging from 25% to 59% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has accelerated over the last two quarters, including a spike from 35% to 70% in Q1. ZTO is expected to report Q2 numbers in the second half of August.


China Stocks Near A Buy Point
-----------------------------


While several Chinese stocks have faltered recently, ZTO, Alibaba and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) are among a handful of China stocks in or near a potential buy zone.


On Monday, ZTO bolted nearly 9% to 22.43 in heavy volume. As you like to see on a breakout, the relative strength line hit a 52-week high. On Tuesday, the stock was down 2%, but still within the 21.80-22.89 buy range.


A 2.0 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for ZTO shares.



After a short-lived breakout attempt, Alibaba fell below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume at the end of June. While the internet giant has yet to retake that bench mark line, it does appear to be forming a new base. It would be a later-stage flat base with a 211.80 entry.


Fellow [Chinese internet stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) Baidu is also trying to recover from a recent failed breakout. Baidu is now building a second-stage [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 273.71 buy point.

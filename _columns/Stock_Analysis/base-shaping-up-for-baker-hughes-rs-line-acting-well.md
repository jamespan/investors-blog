**Baker Hughes** ([BHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHI)) continues to form a base with steady price action.

  

The maker of oil drilling equipment has been consolidating for six weeks 1. The chart pattern has a cup shape, but with a decline of 15% it can be considered a possible flat base.

  

The potential buy point is 79.34, or 10 cents above the peak in the base. Another possible buy point exists at 76.75, based on an intermediate high on June 3 2.

  

The stock's Relative Strength line is pushing into new-high territory 3. That's impressive, particularly since the stock has been consolidating.

  

The line compares the stock's price performance with the S&P 500's. So the upward sloping line tells you it's outperforming the market.

  

Baker Hughes' base not only has quiet price action but areas of tightness, which is also desirable.

  

The price closes of the first three weeks in May were all within 1.2% of each other 4.

  

Baker Hughes' Accumulation/Distribution Rating, up/down volume ratio and Relative Price Strength Rating are all suggesting strong price action.

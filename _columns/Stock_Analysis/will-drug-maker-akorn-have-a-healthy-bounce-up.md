Today let's check out **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), a pharmaceutical company based in Illinois.

  

The firm develops specialty drugs for use in ophthalmology, hospitals and as injectables.

  

Last month the drugmaker reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates and also raised its guidance.

  

The stock is also featured on the IBD 50 list.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

For this quarter, Wall St. anticipates the company's earnings will grow 66%.

  

At 18%, Akorn's 3-year earnings growth is a little under the 25% level you'd like to see.

  

But analysts expect earnings to increase a robust 87% this year.

  

It's great when a company is profitable, but you also want to see sales climbing.

  

Akorn is making a respectable showing in sales growth, which contributes to its "A" SMR Rating. That rating measures a company's sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.

  

**Leaderboard Daily Chart Analysis**

  

The top 10 stocks on the IBD 50 are also featured in the Leaderboard's IBD 50 section. As you can see on the Leaderboard chart on this page, after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in May, Akorn staged a big run up, hitting new highs along the way.

  

This month the stock pulled back to find support at the 50-day moving average line.

  

The bounce from that support area puts Akorn in a buy zone. But the 10-day moving average line has offered resistance.

  

You might want to keep your eye on the stock to see if it can move higher and continue its climb on heavy volume

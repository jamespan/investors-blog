Like many other energy stocks, **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) is holding up relatively well as the stock market goes through a correction.




Although [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis shows the stock is in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), the handle is excessively deep at 36%. So a better interpretation of the chart is that the handle itself is a cup formation. With a dip over the past two weeks, a handle buy point can be seen at 41.08.


The left side of the base was formed during a phase of heavy selling from January to the May low. But the stock shows signs of accumulation on the right side of the base. Two weeks of heavy volume as the stock rebounded across the 40-week moving average showed that buyers have been coming into the global oil services leader.


Halliburton reported second-quarter earnings July 19. Sales growth slowed to 14% to $5.8 billion. Earnings per share of 77 cents were up 57% from the year-ago period.


Shares of the energy stock fell in strong volume after the mixed Q2 results. But Halliburton pared losses quickly to continue forming the base.


Operating margins were a bright spot in Q2, up 329 basis points from the prior year. The company said 47% of total revenue came from North America.


The energy behemoth generated free cash flow of $798 million and completed a share repurchase of $248 million. Its capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue is a low 5%-6% and strengthens its free-cash-flow generation.


Halliburton is engaged in the several stages of oil exploration and production, starting from exploration and well development to production, management and well abandonment.


Analysts Bullish On Energy Stock
--------------------------------


Analysts at UBS have a positive outlook for the oil and gas sector as shareholder returns and stronger balance sheets became priorities for oil plays.


Analysts are bullish on the group's free-cash-flow outlook for 2024 as a result, and they expect support from firm crude oil prices. UBS' consensus forecast for West Texas intermediate crude is a range of $77 to $82.72 a barrel through 2025.


A fall in rig counts remains a concern. But according to the latest reports from the Energy Information Administration, productivity is on the rise as oil prices stabilize, which will likely offset the lower rig count.


A voluntary cut in oil production from the OPEC+ producers in July is also helping oil prices.


Integrated oil plays like Halliburton along with **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) are the favored subsector in the group for UBS analysts. Halliburton stock is the firm's top pick in the energy services industry.


UBS maintained a buy rating on Halliburton and increased its price target from 49 to 52. That indicates a 34% gain from the current trading price of 38.70.

Today we're going to look at **Dril-Quip** ([DRQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRQ)), which was featured in a Dec. 24 [New America Article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/122313-683936-drilquip-drq-profit-fueled-by-offshore-drilling-wave.htm). The company makes offshore drilling and production equipment that's well suited for use in harsh deep water conditions.

  

Almost all of its products are made to be used in water that's more than 1,000 feet deep. Its equipment is used by major U.S. and foreign oil and gas companies in offshore drilling areas around the world.

  

And lately the firm has been enjoying a healthy growth spurt. Analysts say that's caused by an increase in deep water drilling around the world, thanks to strong commodity prices and the desire of oil companies to find new energy reserves.

  

The company is vertically integrated and analysts say that allows it to control product reliability and quality at every step of the manufacturing process.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings were up 44% last quarter. 

  

• Sales growth ranged from 9% to 26% the past five quarters. 

  

• Last quarter sales growth came in at 18%, which is below the 25% minimum rate you typically see in leading growth stocks. So watch to see if that improves. 

  

• Going forward, analysts expect earnings to climb 38% in 2013, which just ended, and they see a 31% increase in 2014 Stock Checkup. [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dril-quip-inc-drq.aspx) shows Dril-Quip's 76 Composite Rating is the third highest among the stocks in its Oil & Gas-Machinery/Equipment industry group.

  

The group as a whole is ranked No. 135 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Dril-Quip notched a new high in October, then pulled back and began to form a base.

  

For those of you who are counting bases, this is a second-stage base. It's typically later-stage bases - like third- or fourth-stage - that have a higher risk of failing.

  

As of Tuesday morning it's still trading about 12% below its old high. So it still has some work to do before it's in a position to breakout and launch a new climb.

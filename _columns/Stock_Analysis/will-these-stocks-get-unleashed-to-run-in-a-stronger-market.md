 With the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average coming under selling pressure, investors should be cautious about making any new buys. If the market enters a downtrend, it will likely take most stocks down with it.
But as they say, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. So keep an eye on stocks that continue to show strength and resilience, including **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)), **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)).


Alibaba, Synopsys, Microchip Technology and Coherent are all on the [IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


3 Traits To Look For
--------------------


In addition to solid fundamentals, see if your stocks are showing these positive telltale signs.


**Support At Important Benchmarks:** Look for support at key areas like the 10-week moving average or a recent buy point.


After finding support around its 104.67 buy point and 10-day line, Alibaba jumped into the upper end of a buy zone in good volume last week, and has been holding the bulk of those gains on Monday.


Chip designer Synopsys has been trading in a tight range along its 10-day moving average, holding gains from a big gap up on Feb 16. Such behavior shows investors are sitting tight and may be quietly adding to their positions.



**Building A Base Or Showing Tight Trading:** When the market pauses or corrects, look for stocks forming new [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), which could become launchpads when the indexes rebound. Apollo and Microchip Technology are forming bases.


After failing to close above 200.63 entry in a flat base Friday, Coherent bounced back into the buy zone on Monday, with volume trending about 10% above average.



In addition to Synopsys, check the narrow weekly closes by Analog Devices, which has held its gains after rising nearly 8% during the week ended Feb. 17. On Monday, the stock was edging lower to test its 10-week line.


Alternative investment firm Apollo Global Management is also building a base, with tight trading inside the pattern. It also opened the week lower, but in afternoon trading was rebounding and trying to hold its 10-day moving average.


Semiconductor manufacturer Microchip Technology has added a handle to its cup pattern, creating a potential 75 buy point.


New bases and tight trading may mean a stock will get unleashed to run in a better market.


**Resilient Relative Strength Line:** The RS line shows if a stock is outperforming or lagging the S&P 500. Analog Devices, Synopsys and Microchip Technology are all showing strength, with the latter building a new flat base.

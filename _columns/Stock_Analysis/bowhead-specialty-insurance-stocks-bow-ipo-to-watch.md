[Market corrections](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-corrections-how-to-sell-stocks-manage-risk-and-prepare-for-next-uptrend/) and bear markets call for caution and a keen respect for [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/). But they also call for diligence in maintaining a list of stocks to watch. One stock to keep an eye on right now is **Bowhead Specialty** ([BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)), which hails from a sector not exactly known as exciting — insurance.


As the Nasdaq remains mired below its 200-day line, [insurance stocks](https://www.investors.com/tag/insurance-stocks/) shine as a bright spot in a dark market. Here are five telltale clues showing how and why Bowhead stock is swimming toward a breakout while the major [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) remain trapped underwater.




1. Bowhead Buoyed By 133% Growth
--------------------------------


Based in New York City, Bowhead Specialty provides casualty, professional liability and health care liability insurance products. The company focuses on small, niche and hard-to-place risks. Policies are primarily written on a non-admitted basis, or through excess and surplus lines, known as E&S. Admitted carriers are bound by state regulations regarding rates, forms and the types of risks they can cover. E&S carriers like Bowhead are not, allowing them to offer coverage for higher-risk or unusual situations.


Free of the restrictions that admitted carriers face, Bowhead says its focus on E&S policies enables the company to rapidly adjust to emerging market opportunities.


It appears to be working. Bowhead Specialty, which went public in May, has generated sales growth ranging from 26% to 77% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has ranged from 20% to 200% during the same period.


In the fourth quarter, Bowhead generated revenue growth of 44% to $119.3 million. Earnings rose 133% to 42 cents per share. For the full year, analysts forecast a 26% increase in earnings to $1.62 per share, followed by a 21% gain to $1.97 per share in 2026.


2. Soaring Relative Strength Shows Market Leadership
----------------------------------------------------


Showing clear market leadership for its 2024 initial public offering, Bowhead's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) continues to soar. In fact, it earns a coveted [blue dot in MarketSurge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-technical-analysis-marketsurge/), as does industry group peer **EverQuote** ([EVER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVER)).


A rising RS line shows a stock is outpacing the general market, as represented by the benchmark S&P 500.


The upward spikes in the RS line for companies like Bowhead and EverQuote emphasize the strength of the diversified insurance group.


3. Bowhead Stock Shares No. 1 Rank In Leading Group
---------------------------------------------------


With the highest-possible [Composite Rating of 99](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-bowhead-specialty-bow.aspx) from Investor's Business Daily, Bowhead shares top billing in its industry group with [EverQuote](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-everquote-ever.aspx) and **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)).


The group ranks a strong No. 27 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Showing the strength of the broad insurance sector, **Ryan Specialty** ([RYAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAN)) — hailing from the No. 28-ranked Insurance-Brokers group — also earns a 99 Composite Rating. In the No. 25-ranked Insurance-Property/Casualty/Life group, **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)) and **Root** ([ROOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROOT)) share that honor.

4. Funds Bet On This 2024 IPO
-----------------------------


Bowhead Specialty has flashed multiple signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-track-institutional-demand-to-find-winners/).


In addition to an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) of A, the young insurer has already posted two quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 11 funds with an A rating from IBD own shares of Bowhead.


5. Bowhead Specialty Takes Aim At A Breakout
--------------------------------------------


While formerly high-flying growth stocks like **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) struggle, once-boring insurance stocks have taken center stage.


Bowhead stock stands tall above its key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) as it takes aim a 37.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a first-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle).


In another sign of rising technical strength, Bowhead's [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) moved back above its longer-term [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) earlier this month


Fellow insurance stocks EverQuote and Ryan Specialty have shown similar strength as [Tesla](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-initial-ride-hailing-permit-nvidia-gm-partnership-roadblock/) and [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-wall-street-analysts-react-to-gtc-news/) remain trapped below these key benchmarks.

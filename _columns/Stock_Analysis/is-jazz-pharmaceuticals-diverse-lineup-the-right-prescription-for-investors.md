Today we're going to look at **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), which has carved out a niche for itself with a number of drugs in its lineup. The stock was featured in a June 19 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/061813-660429-jazz-pharmaceuticals-sales-of-xyrem-grow.htm).

  

Its main product is Xyrem, which is used to treat narcolepsy. It accounted for nearly 66% of the company's sales in the first quarter.

  

And it has a portfolio of other drugs that target conditions including obsessive compulsive behavior and schizophrenia.

  

It's also been diversifying its product line up through mergers and acquisitions.

  

For example, its purchase of EUSA Pharma last year added its No. 2 seller Erinaze, which is used to treat childhood cancer, to its product list.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

That product lineup seems to be good for its bottom line:

  

•Earnings growth ranged from 31% to 54% the past five quarters.

  

• Sales growth came in between 91% and 139% during the same period.

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings climbing 29% in 2013 and 23% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

Now let's see how the stock scores in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-jazz-pharmaceuticals-plc-jazz.aspx).

  

Jazz has the top Composite Rating in its Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. So it's the group's leader.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 31 among IBD's 197 groups. So it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

But with the overall market in a correction, it's not a good time to be buying stocks. Still, this may be one to keep on your watch list.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see in the MarketSmith daily chart above, Jazz broke out of a cup-with-handle base in May and had a nice run over the next month or so.

  

As the market fell into a correction, it paused and has been pulling back.

  

Watch to see if it can find support at the 50-day moving average line and can rebound up from it on heavy volume.

  

In that case, if there's a market uptrend underway, the ideal time to buy would be as close to the 50-day line as possible once you see volume start to kick in.

  

The stock may also go on to form a new base. Either way, it may be on to keep an eye on.

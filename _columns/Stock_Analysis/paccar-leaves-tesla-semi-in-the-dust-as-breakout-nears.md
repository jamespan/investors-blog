While **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) continues to skid and the first [Tesla Semis](https://www.tesla.com/semi) roll out the door, commercial truck giant **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) revs up on [record Q1 revenue](https://www.wsj.com/articles/paccar-achieves-excellent-financial-performance-6e6edbce). After reporting a 96% earnings spike on April 25, PCAR stock steers toward a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#flatbase).




Information about the production version of the Tesla Semi, an all-electric Class 8 long-hauler, remains scant. But earlier this month, Tesla [delivered a new fleet of Tesla Semi trucks](https://electrek.co/2023/04/12/tesla-delivers-fleet-tesla-semi-electric-trucks-pepsico/) to **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)).


At [CES 2022](https://www.paccar.com/news/current-news/2022/paccar-exhibits-innovative-electric-connected-and-autonomous-trucks-at-ces-2022/), Paccar exhibited connected and autonomous trucks. The company behind the [Kenworth](https://www.kenworth.com/), [Peterbilt](https://www.peterbilt.com/) and [DAF](http://www.daftrucks.com/) nameplates showcased three vehicles.


The battery electric Kenworth T680E was featured, along with its Paccar battery charger. Recently honored as the International Truck of the Year 2022, the DAF XG+ displayed its state-of-the-art connected services. And completing its trio of autonomous commercial trucks,  Paccar showed off the Peterbilt Model 579, equipped with the Aurora self-driving system from **Aurora Innovation** ([AUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AUR)).


While Paccar puts these next-gen trucks on display, it continues to fuel big growth with its current fleet of light, medium and heavy-duty trucks.


Paccar Accelerates Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------------------


With heavyweight brands Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF in its lineup, Paccar generated $28.8 billion in revenue in 2022. In the first quarter of this year, the company delivered 32% sales growth to just over $8 billion. By comparison, Tesla drove companywide sales of just $23.3 billion in Q1 sales.


In the first quarter, Paccar posted accelerating growth in both the top- and bottom-lines. Next quarter, Wall Street forecasts a 53% earnings increase and 35% EPS growth for the full year.


From 2013 to 2022, Paccar produced 1.6 million trucks, including 185,900 last year.


In addition to trucks, Paccar also designs and manufactures advanced diesel engines, provides financial services and distributes truck parts related to its core business.


The truck giant provides products and services worldwide through an extensive dealer network of 2,200 locations.


Paccar Global sells products in more than 100 countries and continues to expand its dealer network in Asia and worldwide. Roughly half of its sales and profits are generated outside the U.S.


Current Demand: PCAR Stock Vs. TSLA Stock
-----------------------------------------


While Paccar did not join [TSLA stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-is-it-a-buy-now/) on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-scoop-up-shares-in-tesla-apple-microsoft-tsm-and-more/), PCAR stock has recently flashed signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/).


Paccar sports a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.4 up/down volume ratio. As its slide continues, Tesla stock metrics have dropped to a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating and an 0.8 up/down volume ratio.


The [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) tracks buying and selling by mutual funds and other large investors over the past 13 weeks. Paccar's B rating indicates institutional buying during that period. The [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) covers 50 days of trading, dividing total volume on up days by total volume on down days. A number above 1.0 points to demand, with TSLA stock now below that threshold.


Just before and after reporting Q1 earnings, PCAR stock rose above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in huge volume. On Thursday, Paccar fell below its 50-day line early, but reversed higher to close the week above that key benchmark. PCAR stock ended Friday's session just 3% below the 76.82 buy point.


Meanwhile, TSLA stock continues its struggle to gain traction for a new climb. Tesla rose the last two days in light volume but still closed down for a fourth straight.

**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) operates 715 stores in 47 states, offering one-stop shopping for a wide range of beauty products and salon services.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Although earnings growth slowed right after new CEO Mary Dillon came on board in June 2013, Ulta has bounced back with two consecutive quarters of accelerating EPS gains.

  

Sales growth has remained fairly steady, coming in at 22% in three of the past four reports.

  

For fiscal 2015, analysts expect earnings to rise 21%, followed by a 17% gain in fiscal 2016.

  

Bolstered by a solid 23% return on equity, Ulta earns a 98 Composite Rating and has shown signs of institutional accumulation, including an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio and a sharp increase last quarter in the number of funds that own the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a huge advance starting in 2009, Ulta's stock lost its luster in 2012, moving sideways for nearly a year and a half.

  

It showed signs of a makeover last fall, but got slammed after reporting disappointing numbers in December. The stock fell 26% for the week on volume 341% above average.

  

That made for a deep, 39% decline in its current base. But trading has tightened up in the right side of the pattern, and several heavy-volume gap-ups and weekly gains point to institutional buying.

  

On Sept. 12, Ulta soared almost 18% on massive volume after beating estimates and raising forward guidance.

  

If the pattern ends up being a cup without handle, the ideal buy point would be 132.82, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

If Ulta forms a handle, the ideal buy point would be 10 cents above that handle.

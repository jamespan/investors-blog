As customer relationship management giant **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) ascends beyond a recent [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/), fellow cloud CRM leader **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) continues to float new [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-using-flat-base-chart-pattern/) of its own.




Top money managers see more silver linings than clouds for HubSpot, propelling the firm to a spot on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shovel-billions-into-these-five-sectors-including-semiconductors-led-by-avgo-stock/). These large investors pumped over $213 million into HUBS stock.


Two peers in the Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry — **Ceridian** ([CDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDAY)) and **Duck Creek Technologies** ([DCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DCT)) — also garnered interest.


With each earning the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), HubSpot, Ceridian, **DoubleVerify** ([DV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DV)) and **SPS Commerce** ([SPSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPSC)) share a four-way tie for top billing in the industry, which ranks a strong No. 24 out of the [197 groups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/) IBD tracks.


Floating Higher On 91% Growth — And AI-Powered Tools
----------------------------------------------------


Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., HubSpot has spread its CRM footprint globally, working with over 167,00 customers across more than 120 countries. The company's cloud-based platform enables client enterprises to coordinate and cooperate across a wide range of "hubs."


From marketing, sales and service to content management systems and operations, HubSpot offers clients access to a comprehensive suite of CRM tools.


On March 6, HubSpot announced the launch of [two new tools powered by artificial intelligence](https://ir.hubspot.com/news/hubspot-ai?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com%25252Fproducts%25252Fcrm%25252Fenterprise&hubs_content-cta=null&_ga=2.58174570.1944714620.1680121230-368363421.1680121230&_gl=1*1jk1939*_ga*MzY4MzYzNDIxLjE2ODAxMjEyMzA.*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTY4MDEyMTIzMC4xLjAuMTY4MDEyMTIzMC4wLjAuMA..). In addition to its AI-powered content assistant in private beta, HubSpot unveiled ChatSpot.ai.


While pursuing innovations in [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/), HubSpot continues to deliver real and accelerating growth.


Over the last three years, the CRM leader has generated average annual earnings growth of 30%. Including a 91% EPS gain in Q4, HubSpot as posted average earnings growth of 44% over the last three quarters. Consensus analyst estimates call for a 51% gain in Q1 and a 52% gain for the full year.


On the sales front, revenue has ranged from 27% to 53% over the last eight quarters.


HubSpot Sees Clear Skies After Weathering Storm
-----------------------------------------------


After getting pummeled in 2021 and much of 2022, the sun has again shined on HubSpot stock. While weathering a deep, 26-week long [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) base last year, it began to rebound as it headed into 2023.


In a sign of strengthening technical action, it reclaimed its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Plus, that benchmark line headed higher to cross back above the longer-term 40-week line.


Now trading solidly above its 10-week line, HubSpot testing a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/) from a 399.65 entry in a first-stage cup with handle. The stock has also climbed into a buy zone from a 418.49 buy point after forming a new flat base.


After slumping during last year's [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/), the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has rebounded to right around a new 52-week high.


As the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) show improved action, watch for the clouds to continue to part, clearing the way for HubSpot to strengthen its rebound and join [CRM stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-buy-now/) on a ride to new heights.

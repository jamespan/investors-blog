With Q4 earnings expected in early March, [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) member **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) is trying to power lift its way into a new buy zone.
The New Hampshire-based company operates and franchises over 1,200 workout centers in 47 states, Puerto Rico, Canada and the Dominican Republic, priding itself on being a "Judgement Free Zone" and providing a non-intimidating environment.


But judgment day is approaching for the 2015 IPO, with analysts expecting Planet Fitness to deliver fourth quarter earnings growth of 216%. That would further confirm the company's continued rebound from several quarters of negative growth — and mark a fourth straight report with accelerating EPS gains.


Sales growth has been rising over the last two quarters, coming in at 26% in Q3.


Boosted by a 27% annual pretax profit margin and 52% return on equity, Planet Fitness earns a 94 Composite Rating and the No. 2 rank within the Leisure — Services industry group.


Class Of 2015's Base-On-Base Patterns
-------------------------------------


Since going public in August 2015, the trajectory of Planet Fitness's stock has been fairly similar to fellow 2015 IPOs **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) and **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)).


All three stocks very quickly began forming bases after making their market debuts, but have rebounded to launch new climbs, forming additional bases along the way.



Although Planet Fitness has broken out of two bases and is now working on a third, it's failed to rise at least 20% from each breakout; therefore, all three consolidations are part of a first-stage [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/).


Match Group has followed the same path, while Ollie's did clear the 20% benchmark from its initial breakout and is now working on a second-stage base-on-base.


On Monday, Planet Fitness rose nearly 2% to bring it within 1% of a 22.17 buy point.


While volume was below average, an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio indicate demand for the stock.


The Relative Strength line has been trending higher and approaching new high ground, and in another sign of renewed technical strength, note how the shorter-term 10-day moving average has climbed back above the longer-term 50-day line.


After giving back Monday's gains on Tuesday, the stock found support at and bounced off its 10-day moving average line, but volume remained below average.


Look for volume on up days to rise and trading on down days to lighten up, and see if Planet Fitness can clear the entry and deliver the stellar Q4 earnings growth analysts expect.

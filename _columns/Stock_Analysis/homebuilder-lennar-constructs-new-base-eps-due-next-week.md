With Q4 earnings expected next week, homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) may be poised to break past the 48.10 buy point in its latest base.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Lennar has posted more than eight quarters of strong earnings and sales growth, with revenue gains ranging from 26% to 53%. While its earnings growth is no longer in triple digits, the stock edged higher, to 44%, in the latest report.

  

Lennar is scheduled to report its latest numbers before the market open Jan. 15. For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 47%, followed by a 21% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

The homebuilders industry group is currently ranked No. 79 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, but that's up from No. 123 just a week earlier. Lennar's 96 Composite Rating is highest among its industry-group peers.

  

The stock's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate institutional buying over the last three months. Its 1.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio also points to demand. Fund ownership has risen the past two quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Lennar is working on a cup-shaped pattern with a 48.10 buy point as part of a first-stage base-on-base pattern. Within that consolidation, there have been several up weeks on heavy volume, a sign that institutional investors have been picking up shares.

  

On Wednesday, Lennar closed almost 5% higher as a better-than-expected jobs report for December boosted retail and construction stocks. Volume was 204% above average.

  

See if Lennar can punch through the 48.10 buy point on volume at least 40% to 50% higher than normal. Also see if the nascent market uptrend takes hold or falters, and watch for Lennar's Q4 earnings report.

Based in the Netherlands, **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) is the co-inventor and leading supplier of near field communication or NFC, a form of wireless that lets devices share small amounts of data when they're in close proximity to each other.

  

It's used in both Apple Pay and Google Wallet, which allow consumers to make credit card payments directly from their smarthphones.

  

NXP Semiconductors got a boost from Apple using its chips in the latest iPhones, but on the downside, NXP was recently cut out of the business for Samsung Galaxy handsets.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Helped by demand for its chips inside the Apple iPhone 6, NXP's sales growth jumped from 14% to 21% in Q3.

  

Earnings growth has also been on the rise, showing acceleration to 54% and 59% in the last two reports.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 43%, followed by a 16% gain in 2015.

  

NXP sports an impressive 71% return on equity and a 3-year EPS growth rate of 84%, helping it earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

Institutional investors have taken note. The stock has a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a solid 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

There's also been a big jump in fund ownership in recent quarters, including an increase from 785 funds to 860 in Q3.

  

NXP made IBD's latest list of [New Buys of Top Performing Funds For Past Three Months](http://news.investors.com/PDF/mutbuys_110414.pdf), which came out in Wednesday's paper. 44 funds bought a total of $330 million worth of NXP shares during that period.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

NXP Semiconductors launched a huge move in May 2013, finding good support at its 10-week line along the way.

  

After forming multiple bases, it sold off sharply in September and October. It fell over 16% during the week ended Oct. 10 on fears the semiconductor industry had entered a down cycle. Most chip stocks also took a hit. It's a good reminder of how chip stocks can be cyclical and volatile.

  

NXP found its footing the following week and has since been working on the right side of a new base.

  

Note how it's more V-shaped than you would prefer to see. That's typically a negative sign, but it's mitigated by the fact that it essentially reflects the similar V-shaped patterns the S&P and Nasdaq have formed recently.

  

NXP's current consolidation is considered first-stage, since the new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.

  

The ideal buy point is 73.92, 10 cents above the peak on the left. As of early Thursday morning, NXP was trading right around that price.

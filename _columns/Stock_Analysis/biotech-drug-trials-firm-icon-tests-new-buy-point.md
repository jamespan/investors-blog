Medical stocks have done well recently and **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) may ride that wave to a new breakout.

  

The Ireland-based firm provides clinical research services to pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies, helping them bring their products to market faster and at lower cost.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings jumped last quarter from 49% to 76%. While sales growth has been slower, it has edged higher in each of the last two quarters, coming in at 14% in Q3. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter numbers in mid-February.

  

Icon's 13% return on equity is below the 17% minimum you prefer, but overall it earns a respectable 94 Composite Rating. Its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio point to institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Icon's share price has more than doubled since coming out of a 58-week-long cup-with-handle in July 2012. It was generally a steady ride for most of that run, with tight trading and good support along the 10-week line.

  

Things got bumpier last March, but there was a silver lining. It undercut the low in the prior pattern, resetting the base count.

  

Icon broke out of that new first-stage pattern in August and again moved higher in an orderly fashion until late October, when it began forming its current, second-stage consolidation.

  

There have been signs of institutional accumulation in the right side of the base and the stock reclaimed its 10-week moving average earlier this month.

  

The buy point is 59.91. See if Icon can punch through that price on volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal.

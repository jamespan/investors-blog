While earnings season is in full swing, [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Guidewire Software** ([GWRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWRE)) still has time to possibly launch a new breakout ahead of its next quarterly report in late November.









 
 
 Fellow IBD 50 members **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) are also among the [stocks in or near a buy zone ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/). On Friday, Facebook was trying to retake a 175.59 entry as it gets ready to report Wednesday, while Universal Display continued to work on a late-stage pattern with earnings due Thursday.
Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports, since you don't know if it will gap up like **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) or tumble like **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)).


Mixed Signals
-------------


On Sept. 6, Guidewire posted a spike in EPS growth from 14% to 51% for fiscal Q4, ended July 31. Sales growth increased for the second straight quarter, from 25% to 28%. The stock rose over 9% the next day.


But for the current quarter, analysts expect the provider of cloud-based claims management and billing software for the insurance industry to post an 800% *decline* in earnings.


A quick diagnosis in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows Guidewire earns a mix of pass and fail ratings for the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). It earns passing grades for its 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), 93 EPS Rating, B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


But Guidewire comes up short in terms of EPS estimates for the current quarter (analysts expect a loss) and current fiscal year (-8% decline in EPS).


How should you interpret those mixed signals? Let the chart action and general market conditions be the ultimate decision makers.



If the relative strength line moves closer to new high ground as Guidewire clears its 81.56 buy point in heavy volume, it could offer a buying opportunity.


But as Guidewire and its insurance industry peers understand well, there are no guarantees in life. So be sure to always follow [defensive sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) if a trade doesn't work out.

In a volatile market like the one we're in now, pay attention to stocks showing resilience and relative strength. Online education leader **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) fits that bill, with its RS line in new-high ground as it forms a new base.


Based in Santa Clara, Calif., Chegg provides online education services to help high school and college students boost their grades, find the right college, and kick off their careers. It also helps university students reduce costs by searching for scholarships and by renting, rather than buying, textbooks.

No. 1-Ranked Online Education Stock
-----------------------------------


With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Chegg earns the No. 1-ranking among its peers in the Consumer Services-Education group. Other industry leaders include **Strategic Education** ([STRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRA)), **Bright Horizons Family Solutions** ([BFAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BFAM)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and **K12** ([LRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRN)).


Chegg has grown earnings at an average annual pace of 145% over the last three years, earning it a spot on a recent list of [today's fastest-growing stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/). In Q3, the company posted an EPS gain of 600%. Analysts are looking for a 40% increase in the current quarter.


Consensus analyst estimates for the current full year (79%) and 2019 (26%) were both recently revised higher.


Over the last four quarters, Chegg has posted revenue growth ranging from 17% to 32%.


Mutual funds and other large investors have taken note. Chegg has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership, and currently sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Fifty-four funds with an A+ rating have reported a position in the stock.


Resets Base Count After 291% Climb
----------------------------------


Chegg broke out of a cup with handle in March 2017, launching a 291% gain over the next 18 months. As the general market became more volatile, Chegg also pulled back and began forming its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in September of this year.


As the stock fell as much as 31% while forming the consolidation, it undercut the low in its prior pattern. That [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making Chegg's current consolidation a first-stage base. Resetting the base count after a big price run is a potentially positive sign. It means the stock may be getting set to launch a fresh run when a new market uptrend begins.


Keep in mind, however that the market is [currently in a correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), meaning it's best to avoid making any new buys. But Chegg is showing resilience with its RS line already at a new 52-week high as it continues to move closer to a 32.92 buy point.


Stocks showing that type of market-leading strength in a downtrend are often the ones that move higher in a new rally.


On Tuesday, Chegg gave back some its gains from earlier in the day, but still closed 1.6% higher at 29.27, leaving it 11% below the entry. Note that the stock may form a handle to offer an earlier buy point at 30.45. A handle takes a minimum of five days to form, and Wednesday will be Day 5.


In early trading Wednesday, the stock was up 0.8%.

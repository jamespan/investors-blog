Investors may be canceling their reservations about restaurant stocks and getting ready to help industry leaders like **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) serve up new breakouts.


Although each has a Composite Rating below 90, Dave & Buster's, **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) and **Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)) are all forming chart patterns that could launch a new breakout.


Meanwhile, pizza giant **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) cleared an 82.65 entry last week and is still trading just within the 82.65 to 86.78 buy zone.


Papa John's 93 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 ranking among restaurant stocks, while Dave & Buster's 89 rating landing the No. 2 spot.


Jack In The Box and Texas Roadhouse both sport an 87 Composite Rating, putting them both among the industry group's top five leaders.


Will Earnings Push Play Or Pause?
---------------------------------


Dave & Buster's sports a 79% three-year EPS growth rate, but profit gains cooled off to 25% in its most recent report. Sales growth also slowed to 12%.


The Dallas-based company, which operates 87 restaurant/arcade venues offering patrons an opportunity to "Eat, Drink, Play and Watch," is set to report fiscal 2016 third-quarter results on Dec. 6.


For the full fiscal year, which ends Jan. 29, 2017, analysts expect earnings to rise 28%, followed by a 15% rise in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Dave & Buster's has said it expects to open 10 to 11 new stores this fiscal year.


Double-Bottom Breakout Ahead?
-----------------------------


The September 2014 IPO has risen more than 150% from the closing price of its market debut.


The stock is now working on a [double bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) with a 47.40 entry.



Riding the wave that has lifted restaurant stocks since Donald Trump's surprise win on Nov. 8, Dave & Buster's has moved solidly back above its 10-week line.


A 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio, B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and seven quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional interest in the stock.


Dave & Buster's edged fractionally lower on Thursday, putting it just one day away from completing a handle, which takes a minimum of five days to form. A handle would offer a slightly earlier entry of 46.94.


Look for Dave & Buster's to clear either buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal, and see what type of numbers it reports on Dec. 6.

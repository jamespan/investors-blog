**Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) is among three stocks in the No. 8-ranked enterprise software industry group that have the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The developer of business service management (BSM) software joins **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) in this elite group.




**Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)), which was featured in the [Breakout Stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/cloud-stocks-to-watch-five9-tests-new-all-time-high/) column on April 2, and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) are just behind Coupa stock with a 98 rating. A 99 Composite Rating means the company is outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). (Use [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to see the score for each of your stocks.)


Several factors are driving the high ratings for Coupa stock. Over the last two quarters, earnings growth has exploded from 40% in fiscal Q2 (ended July 31) to 150% and 320% in fiscal Q3 and Q4, respectively.


That far outpaces quarterly EPS growth in the latest reports for DocuSign (100%), ServiceNow (25%) and Five9 (17%).

Coupa Earnings Face Coronavirus Test
------------------------------------


Through its cloud-based software, Coupa helps clients manage their business spending, procurement, invoicing, and supplier and contract management.


Revenue has been growing at an average annual clip of 42% over the last three years. Several of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-lead-apple-netflix-microsoft-google-coronavirus-stock-market-rebound-attempt/) have reported owning shares in COUP stock, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). Plus, 171 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning Coupa shares.


The California-based BSM leader has not set a date for its fiscal Q1 earnings report, which is expected in late April or early May. Analysts are looking for another triple-digit gain at 133%. See if Coupa can continue to post stellar numbers despite the economic shutdowns caused by the coronavirus.


COUP Stock Developing Resistance To Coronavirus Stock Market Crash
------------------------------------------------------------------


After selling off in February and March in the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), COUP stock is rebounding from its lows.


DOCU stock, which had its IPO in April 2018, has broken out to an all-time high, while Five9 stock is pushing into new-high ground.Â Like Paycom and Salesforce, Coupa is consolidating, with a mix of technical strengths and flaws.


On the positive side, unlike industry peers **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), COUP stock is trading above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). That's one sign of [institutional support](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) for Coupa.


On the downside, the 10-week moving averages for Coupa, Paycom and ServiceNow are still sloping downward. Look for those benchmark lines to find a bottom and begin to reverse higher.


COUP stock is closer to achieving that change than either Paycom or Salesforce. Also note that Coupa's 10-week line is trying to stay above the longer-term 40-week moving average. CRM stock and PAYC stock have yet to reclaim that distinction.


Coupa closed the week up more than 2%, leaving it 8% shy of a 178.10 buy point as its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) floats just below a new 52-week high. See if it can continue to show resistance to the volatile coronavirus stock market as it also nears a new all-time high.

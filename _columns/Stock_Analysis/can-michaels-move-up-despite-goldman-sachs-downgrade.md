After a **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) downgrade from buy to neutral, arts and crafts chain **Michaels** ([MIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIK)) moved lower Friday morning, but rebounded to recoup the bulk of the drop.


The stock has been building the handle within a cup-with-handle base as it tries to clear a 29.66 entry.


Michaels and cosmetics store operator **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are both members of the specialty retailers industry group, which has jumped from a No. 99 ranking to No. 18 over the last six weeks.


Michaels’ 91 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot among its industry peers, just behind Ulta. **Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers** ([RBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBA)), **Party City** ([PRTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRTY)) and **Sally Beauty** ([SBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBH)) round out the top-five industry leaders.


Irving, Texas-based Michaels made IBD’s latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds over the last three months, with two leading funds investing a total of over $8 million. Ulta Beauty also made the list.


Michaels’ revenue gains have been modest, ranging from 1% to 6% over the past eight quarters. Earnings growth has come in between 16% and 23% in the last four reports. The company is expected to report earnings for Q1 fiscal 2016, which ended in April, on June 2.


Crafting Base In Troubled Market
--------------------------------


After its 2014 IPO, Michaels formed a pair of bases that launched a more-than-60% gain in just five months.


Since then the stock has been working on its current 58-week-old cup with handle.


Although the relative strength line has dipped slightly as the handle has been forming, it remains near new high ground.


When evaluating any stock, keep in mind that the general market has come under selling pressure. If you buy stocks in this type of environment, be sure to have a defensive plan in place in case the trade goes against you.

**Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) has joined **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI))and other chip stocks that have recently staged successful breakouts.

  

The Silicon Valley-based firm designs high-performance, energy-efficient analog semiconductors for use in cloud computing, telecom, automotive and other industries.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Although earnings and sales growth slowed slightly last quarter, Monolithic beat estimates for both the top and bottom lines. Revenue grew 19%, while EPS increased 34%.

  

Monolithic pays a dividend with a 1.2% annualized yield and sports a solid 20% return on equity.

  

Overall, it has a 98 Composite Rating and a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating moderate institutional buying over the past 13 weeks. The number of funds with a position in the stock has been rising in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a nice, steady climb starting in July 2013, Monolithic Power sold off sharply last October. But there was a silver lining. The stock's new low undercut the low in the prior consolidation, resetting the base count to make the new formation a first-stage pattern.

  

The stock broke out in December, but failed to go up at least 20% before starting a new consolidation. So the current flat base is part of a first-stage base-on-base formation.

  

As it built the right side of the flat base, Monolithic reclaimed its 10-week on heavy volume, bringing it closer to the 50.76 buy point.

  

It got above that price on Feb. 13, but closed below it. On Thursday, the stock managed to retake and close above the buy point, as volume came in 45% above average. As of Friday's close, Monolithic Power was still within buying range.

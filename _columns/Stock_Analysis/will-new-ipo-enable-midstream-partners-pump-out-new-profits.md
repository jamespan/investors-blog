Today we'll look at **Enable Midstream Partners** ([ENBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENBL)), which just went public in April. It owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets in the United States.

  

Enable operates through two segments: gathering and processing, transportation and storage.

  

As of September 2013 the company owned 11 processing plants, 7,800 miles of interstate pipelines 2,300 miles of intrastate pipeline and eight storage facilities.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Prior to going public, companies will sometimes only report their pre-IPO earnings and sales in annual terms, without breaking them down by quarter. In that case, the annual or comparable numbers will simply be divided by the number of relevant quarters.

  

That's why, as is the case with Enable, you'll see exactly the same percentages in consecutive quarters.

  

The first quarter of this year marked the company's first post-IPO report and both earnings and sales showed strong triple-digit gains.

  

As is often the case with brand-new IPOs, fund ownership data and other information is not always available.

  

But helped by a strong 28% return on equity and a 58% annual growth rate, Enable is already sporting some strong ratings, including the highest-possible score for its EPS Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, you can see the stock is just starting to form a potential IPO base.

  

The stock has performed well since its April 11 market debut.Enable has been helped by the strength of its industry group, which includes several leaders that have generally been bucking the recent general market downtrend.

  

The stock is in the third week of its consolidation. Since it's an IPO base, it can be shorter than more traditional patterns, such as a flat base which requires at least five weeks to form.

  

But also keep in mind that IPO bases can be more volatile, and that's especially true during a market correction.

  

The ideal buy point is 25.59 buy point, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

Note the Relative Strength Line. It's been trending sharply higher — meaning the stock is outperforming the S&P500 — and it's in new high ground. That's a positive sign of market leadership, and strength in the face of a general downtrend.

  

Although Enable Midstream Partners hasn't been trading long enough to establish an average daily volume line, you can see how volume was lower on down days and higher on up days. That points to institutional accumulation, and shows that big investors weren't in a rush to sell their shares.

  

While the stock has been showing signs of strength, it's best not to make new buys while the the market is in a correction.

  

Also, although energy-related stocks like Enable Midstream Partners have been leading the market lately, that can change quickly. And if a stock's sector or industry group starts to decline, it typically spells trouble for the stock itself.

  

That said, with a record of solid earnings and sales growth and market-leading relative strength, Enable may be one to watch as we wait for a new uptrend to begin.

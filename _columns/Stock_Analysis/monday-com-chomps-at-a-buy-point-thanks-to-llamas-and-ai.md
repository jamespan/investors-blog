Plenty of people don't like Mondays. But 2021 IPO **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) has combined playful productivity with artificial intelligence in the form of the [Llama Farm Widget](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415714043538-The-Llama-Farm-Widget) and [Monday AI](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/11512670770834-Get-started-monday-AI). That has savvy investors grazing on MNDY stock, which makes this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/meta-stock-tesla-google-panw-lead-ai-stocks-to-watch-as-best-mutual-funds-fuel-artificial-intelligence-lovefest/).




Fellow enterprise software firms **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), which was just featured on the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/workday-drives-demand-for-ai-stocks-beyond-nvidia-and-google/), also worked their way onto the screen of new buys by top money managers.


With a 94 [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-mondaycom-mndy.aspx), Monday.com has also earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) screens. Showing institutional demand, MNDY stock sports a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and B- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/).

AI, Llama Farm And Microsoft Partnership Boost Monday.com
---------------------------------------------------------


Based in Israel, Monday.com offers the Work OS, a low-code/no-code platform that democratizes the power of software. The platform enables organizations to easily build work management tools and cloud-based software applications for Creative & Design, Software Development, Marketing, HR, Sales & CRM and more.


The company has over 1,600 employees serving more than [186,000 customers](https://monday.com/customers) around the world, including large-cap firms like **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)). Founded in 2012, Monday.com now has customers across 200 industries in over 200 countries and territories.


Looking to make the platform both productive and playful, Monday.com's [Llama Farm Widget](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415714043538-The-Llama-Farm-Widget) features color-coded and quirky llama icons. The widgets transform the items on customers' task boards into a gamelike view of the goals they are trying to reach.


Like Workday, which has artificial intelligence deeply embedded into its machine learning and automation processes, Monday.com has entered the AI space with [Monday AI](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/11512670770834-Get-started-monday-AI). The currently available Monday AI apps were built internally at Monday.com by a few different teams on a shared infrastructure. In the near future, external developers will be able to leverage this same infrastructure to create their own apps using Monday AI technology and will be available to customers through the app marketplace.


In May, Monday.com unveiled a partnership with fellow AI stock **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and its Teams software. Leveraging the Israeli firm's customer relationship management (CRM) platform, the [Monday.com integration with Microsoft Teams](https://ir.monday.com/news-and-events/news-releases/news-details/2023/monday.com-Announces-New-Integration-with-Microsoft-Teams-to-Increase-Customer-Facing-Teams-Efficiency/default.aspx) allows customers to access and edit their pipeline and all of its data in one place.


Monday.com Moving Into Profit Mode
----------------------------------


As often happens with IPOs, Monday.com is now transitioning into profit mode after posting impressive sales growth.


Revenue growth has ranged from 42% to 95% over the last eight quarters, although it has decelerated in recent reports. In Q2, the company posted $175.7 million in sales, a 42% gain over the prior-year quarter. Over the last three years, the productivity software play has produced average annual revenue growth of 78%.


Although compared with prior-year quarters that showed a loss, Monday.com has begun to generate triple-digit earnings growth, ranging from 115% to 269% in its last four reports. While analysts expect a full-year loss this year, Wall Street forecasts 43% EPS growth to $1.37 in 2024.


MNDY Stock Rising As Market Rebounds
------------------------------------


Monday.com was featured as a breakout IPO on [Oct. 21, 2021](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/ipos-to-watch-monday-com-nears-breakout-with-earnings-due/), as MNDY stock aimed to build on its impressive market debut in June 2021. But showing the volatility often seen in new issues, the stock fell into a long and steep decline until finding its footing in November 2022.


As the promise of profitability began to kick in, Monday.com went on to form a [first-stage cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) from February to May of 2023. Heavy volume in the right side of that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/) revealed strong, clear demand for the stock.


Currently, MNDY stock continues to work on an early-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) showing a 189.15 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The AI stock also offers a potential early trendline entry at around 177.


As the Nadsaq and S&P 500 build on [Tuesday's follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-powers-higher-on-jolts-data-unlocks-this-key-shift-apple-stock/), look for Monday.com to ride the AI wave and its improving profit outlook into buy range.


Also note a positive rise in the [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for Monday.com and industry peers Workday and ServiceNow. Fellow enterprise software firm **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) [gapped up above its 50-day line on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-q32023/) Thursday in huge volume, confirming demand for the group and AI stocks in general.

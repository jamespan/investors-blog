On this month list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-uber-msft-google-meta/), top-performing money managers devoured shares of artificial intelligence leaders like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). But they also found sustenance by adding shares of retailers like **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) to their shopping carts.




[Retail industry](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) giants **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) also made the list.


Another thing Sprouts Farmers Market shares in common with Costco and Target, as well as [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/), is that they trade in or near fresh buy zones. Shares of Google have now climbed toward the top of its buy range. Target's base, however, ran into trouble Friday as TGT stock fell below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


[Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/) — Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nvidia-stock-nvda-shakes-off-ai-chip-competition/) — has just popped back above its 21-day line. Plus, NVDA stock just completed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) with a 974 buy point this week.


Sprouts Farmers Market Eyes Fresh Breakout
------------------------------------------


Based in Phoenix, the company has over 400 grocery stores in 23 states. It aims to offer wholesome selection of organic, plant-based and gluten-free products.


Having already made an impressive run, Sprouts Farmers Market now stands poised to launch a new breakout.


SFM stock broke out from a flat base on Dec. 4, rising as much as 47% before coming off an all-time high in February to begin forming its latest setup.


The current formation is a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) with a 65.53 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). While Sprouts failed to hold support at its 21-day line Friday, its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) remains in a clear and strong uptrend,


SFM stock closed the week 5% shy of a breakout.


Meanwhile, as another retailer in demand among the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-2024-benchmark-beating-funds-in-every-category/), Costco has just formed a new flat base of its own. Costco stock has a 787.08 buy point. It jumped back above its 50-day line on Thursday, managing to hold that benchmark on Friday. Costco fell below its 10-week line after [reporting earnings on March 8](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-q4-2023-earnings-ross-abercrombie-costco-dicks/) that missed holiday-quarter revenue expectations.


After a multiyear slump, Target stock is trying to retake a 175.53 buy point it briefly cleared it in light volume at the end of last month. Friday ended on a sour note, with TGT stock dropping over 3%, albeit in light volume.


Earnings Ahead For Sprouts
--------------------------


Last year, Sprouts Farmers Market delivered a 19% year-over-year spike in earnings growth to $2.84 a share. Fourth-quarter sales rose 8% to just under $1.7 billion. Over the last five quarters, revenue growth has ranged from 6% to 8%.


Sprouts is on tap to report first-quarter earnings on May 1. Analysts forecast 2% earnings growth to $1 a share. Sales are expected to rise 7% to $1.85 billion.

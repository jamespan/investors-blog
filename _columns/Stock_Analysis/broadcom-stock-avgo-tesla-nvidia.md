**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is set for a [massive October](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-third-quarter-deliveries-kick-off-massive-october/) with its robotaxi reveal and third-quarter earnings report. But Wall Street also has its eyes on [Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/) as it battles to keep its position as a [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) while **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) slightly eclipses it in terms of market-capitalization weighting on the Nasdaq. But while Broadcom stock now makes up 2.4% of the tech-heavy index to edge past Tesla's 2.3%, Broadcom smokes Tesla in one key rating.




Broadcom Stock Already 'Perfect,' Tesla Recharging
--------------------------------------------------


Throughout much of the summer, Broadcom and Tesla seesawed for that seventh spot in market-cap weighting on the Nasdaq. But Broadcom stock has long and decisively outshined Tesla stock when it comes to their [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/).


Broadcom earns the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-broadcom-avgo.aspx), meaning it's in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of the most important stock-picking factors.


The semiconductor and artificial intelligence powerhouse's rising growth and stock performance undergird that rating. In its latest quarterly report on Sept. 6, Broadcom posted 47% sales growth to $13.1 billion. Earnings rose 18% to $1.24 per share. Analysts see that growth continuing with gains of 26%, 34% and 35% for the next three quarters.


Meanwhile, multiple quarters of anemic and spotty growth dragged Tesla's Composite Rating down to a lowly 39 as of April 1. But now building on its rebound as the robotaxi unveiling approaches, Tesla has seen its Composite Rating improve to a much better, but still far from perfect, [71](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-tsla.aspx).


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nvidia-ibd-stock-of-the-day-is-actionable-as-ai-chipmaker-preps-blackwell/) — has rallied back to earn a [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.aspx) to match Broadcom.

Broadcom Sets Up Alongside Tesla, Nvidia
----------------------------------------


After starting September with a sharp sell-0ff, the Nasdaq has bounced back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). And Broadcom, Tesla and Nvidia have all done the same.


Tesla continues to build a first-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) with a 271 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has perked up as it heads toward a 52-week high. On Friday, shares of TSLA rose 2% to close the with a 9% gain for the week.


Nvidia is working on third-stage [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) showing a 140.76 entry. Its RS line is on the rise but remains off its high. Although down Friday, Nvidia came off its lows to end with over a 4% gain for the week. On Friday, one Wall Street analyst said Nvidia has "[two glaring holes](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-chipmaker-glaring-holes-in-lineup/)" in its data center offering.


After posting six straight up sessions, Broadcom stock broke that streak Friday. But the semiconductor giant remains within striking distance of its all-time high as it looks to etch a new breakout.


Like Nvidia, it has formed a third-stage consolidation base. The buy point is 185.16. Down just under 3% Friday, it ended the week 7% shy of that entry.


In a sign of rising technical strength, its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has climbed back above the 50-day line.


Showing demand, Broadcom stock sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-up-down-volume-ratio/), and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.

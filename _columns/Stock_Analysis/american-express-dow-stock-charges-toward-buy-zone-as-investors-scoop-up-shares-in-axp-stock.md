**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) rival **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) continues to craft a handle and a potential breakout as the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) test their resilience. AXP stock has its sights set on a 182.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).




Along with fellow credit card powerhouse Visa, American Express ranks among the 30 industry leaders on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


An 89 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) indicates [AXP stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-american-express-axp.aspx) outpaces 89% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). Visa slightly tops American Express with a 90 rating, while Mastercard earns an 88.


**Cass Information Systems** ([CASS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CASS)) and **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) are also among the leaders in the credit card and payment processing group.


American Express Delivers On Growth Plan
----------------------------------------


Founded in 1850, American Express is a globally integrated payments company. The New York-based firm provides related products and services to a broad range of customers, including consumers, small businesses, midsize companies and large corporations around the world.


American Express made IBD's list of the [25 Most Trusted Financial Companies](https://www.investors.com/news/most-trusted-financial-companies-top-25-list-2022/), alongside fellow credit card issuer **Discover Financial Services** ([DFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFS)).


On Jan. 27, American Express reported its Q4 and full-year 2022 numbers. It delivered on its [2022 growth plan](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2023/American-Express-Delivers-on-2022-Growth-Plan-With-Full-Year-Revenue-Growth-of-25-and-Earnings-Per-Share-of-9.85/default.aspx), posting revenue growth of 25% and earnings per share of $9.85.


CEO Stephen Squeri said the strong report "demonstrates that our strategy is working, and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic."


American Express earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/profit-margins/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Revenue growth has stayed strong and steady, ranging from 22% to 31% over the last seven quarters.  In 2022, consolidated revenues net of interest expense were $52.9 billion, up 25% from $42.4 billion a year ago. The company said the increase primarily reflected growth in spending by card members compared with 2021.


Bottom-line numbers present a more mixed picture. Earnings growth decelerated from an 866% increase in Q2 of 2021 to an 8% decline in Q2 of last year. Profits have been flat or down compared with prior-year quarters in three of the last four reports.


For this year, analysts expect American Express to post 13% earnings growth, followed by the same increase in 2024.


AXP Stock Gaps Up In Huge Volume On Earnings
--------------------------------------------


Wall Street liked what it saw when American Express reported Q4 and 2022 full-year numbers. AXP stock gapped up sharply in enormous [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) on Jan. 27, managing to hold the bulk of those gains since then. The move also drove a nice spike in the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/).


The big jump reflects demand for shares of American Express. It sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.5 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Plus, 36 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in AXP stock.


American Express has formed a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) with a 182.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a first-stage base. The base is first stage because AXP stock undercut the low in its prior chart pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). Such early-stage bases are more likely to succeed, although action in market indexes also has a major impact.


As the stock finds support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), American Express now trades 4% below the entry.


Meanwhile, Visa stock is testing support at its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) while MA stock falls farther below that benchmark.

Electric vehicles (EVs), 5G and artificial intelligence ([AI](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/)) are big-buzz technologies on Wall Street. But which companies are helping drive those innovations? One is specialty chemicals maker **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)). After rising as much as 362% off its March 2020 coronavirus lows, ESI stock is poised to ignite a new breakout.




Element Solutions was featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/element-solutions-esi-stock-boosted-by-evs-5g-ai-smartphone-markets/) on March 5, just ahead of a breakout on March 9. But the provider of chemicals and solutions for [EVs](https://www.investors.com/news/best-ev-stocks-buy-now-electric-cars/), [5G smartphones](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-5g-wireless-stocks/) and [AI technology](https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/news/esi-ci-artificial-intelligence-workshop/) quickly pulled back. Just as quickly, ESI stock found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), recharging its batteries for a continued run.


The Florida-based company, which [traces its roots back to 1785](https://www.elementsolutionsinc.com/about/our-history), is closing in on a 25.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).

EVs, 5G, AI Provide Elements Of Growth
--------------------------------------


Element Solutions sports a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). The rating, found in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), shows ESI stock is outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). The stock's specialty chemicals industry ranks a solid No. 33 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Helping drive that performance is the company's strong presence in producing a wide range of specialty materials for 5G smartphones and other mobile devices, as well as for EVs and the rest of the automotive industry.


Last quarter, Element Solutions delivered 94% earnings growth. Analysts expect the company to post 55% EPS growth in the current quarter and a 44% increase for the year.


Boosted by favorable trends in EVs and the adoption of 5G, Element Solutions has posted accelerating sales growth in each of the last four quarters. Revenue has risen from a 15% slowdown in Q2 of 2020 to a 52% jump in the second quarter of this year.


Is ESI Stock Concocting A New Breakout?
---------------------------------------


During its huge run since the coronavirus lows of last year, ESI stock has shown consistent support along its 10-week line. After moving higher earlier in Friday's session, Element Solutions retreated to end the day 2% shy of its 24.80 entry.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has come off its highs as the stock formed its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) but is showing signs of an uptick.


As the latest round of [sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-sector-rotation/) continues and industrial stocks come into favor, ESI stock could break out with a boost in demand for EVs and 5G.

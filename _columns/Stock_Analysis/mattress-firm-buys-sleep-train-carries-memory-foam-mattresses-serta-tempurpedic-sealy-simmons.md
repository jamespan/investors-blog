When the market comes under pressure, look for stocks like **Mattress Firm** ([MFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFRM)) that are showing resilience. As [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/020315-737610-mattress-firm-expanding-store-base.htm) noted, the Houston-based firm is the largest specialty mattress retailer in the U.S., with over 2,000 stores. Unlike **Select Comfort** ([SCSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCSS)), which is both manufacturer and retailer, Mattress Firm carries multiple brands, including Serta and **Tempur Sealy International** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)).

  

Mattress Firm has been aggressively buying regional and local stores. Last October, it made its biggest purchase ever, picking up Sleep Train's 310 locations.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

That buying spree has paid off with three consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth, including a 92% increase in fiscal Q4. Earnings growth rose from 27% to 37% in that same report.

  

Mattress Firm has a solid 18% return on equity and a stellar 158% annual EPS growth rate, helping it earn a 98 Composite Rating. The stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio point to solid institutional demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On Aug. 11, the stock gapped up to close nearly 14% higher on preliminary earnings. Volume came in 370% above average.

  

After a brief jump, Mattress Firm began forming a second-stage cup with handle. The stock broke out in November but soon pulled back to form its current cup-shaped pattern.

  

The stock reclaimed the 10-week line in February and flashed a heavy-volume jump on earnings. While the Nasdaq and S&P have come under pressure this week, Mattress Firm has shown resilience.

  

See if it can break past the 71.92 entry, but also watch the indexes, since buying stocks in a weakening market would add more risk.

Austin, Texas-based **Amplify Snack Brands** ([BETR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BETR)) offers consumers a compelling promise: "snacking without compromise." With the stock nearing a buy point, the question now is, "Will investors bite?"


Since going public last August, the number of mutual funds with a position in the stock has been rising, reaching 205 last quarter. Plus, three typically better-performing funds own shares, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) and American Century All-Cap Growth ([TWGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWGTX)).


International Expansion
-----------------------


Amplify is known for its GMO-free, gluten-free and guilt-free "Better-For-You" snacks, including SkinnyPop popcorn and Paqui tortilla chips.


In May, the company expanded its lineup by acquiring Boundless Nutrition and its Oatmega "grass-fed" whey protein bars.


Earlier this month, Amplify announced it is buying Tyrrells, a diversified, international snack firm based in England. Tyrrells offers a wide range of snack brands throughout the European Union, Australia and other markets, generating approximately $111 million in sales over the last 12 months.


While Amplify's revenue growth has been relatively solid and consistent over the last four quarters (ranging from 20% to 26%), earnings have been more erratic. But after slipping from 100% to 0% in Q1, EPS growth bounced back to a 15% gain in the second quarter.


The stock gets a mix of **[pass, neutral and fail ratings in IBD Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-your-stock-an-a-or-d-find-out-before-you-buy/)**, but its 95 Composite Rating earns the No. 4 ranking within the packaged food group, behind **Pinnacle Foods** ([PF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PF)), fellow 2015 IPO **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) and **WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)).  **Lancaster Colony** ([LANC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LANC)) rounds out the top five.


Post-IPO Breakout Attempt: Take 3
---------------------------------


Since its market debut, Amplify has hit resistance around the 16-16.50 mark multiple times, including when it tried to break out of an **[IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/)** in late April and early May.



The stock failed to clear that price range again last month, and then pulled back to form its current consolidation, which still counts as a first-stage base.


The cup pattern is more V-shaped than you would prefer, but Amplify has shown signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, including recapturing its 10-week line in two weeks of above-average volume.


The Relative Price Strength line has been closing in on new high ground as the stock nears a 16.76 buy point.

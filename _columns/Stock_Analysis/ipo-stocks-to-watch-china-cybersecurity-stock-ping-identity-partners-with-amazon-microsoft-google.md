Ping Secures Big Growth With Amazon, Microsoft, Google
------------------------------------------------------


As a leader in cybersecurity, Ping Identity helps cloud giants Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide clients with secure mobile, SaaS (software-as-a-service), and on-premises applications.


By providing cybersecurity for large enterprises, Ping Identity has been delivering investors with fast-growing earnings and sales. In Q3, the company posted 450% EPS growth and a 45% increase in sales, establishing itself as one of the top stocks to watch.


Ping Identity is scheduled to release Q4 and full-year 2019 numbers on March 4 after the stock market close. Analysts are looking for 433% earnings growth in Q4.


While recent EPS growth and current quarterly estimates are strong, note that analysts expect Ping Identity's earnings growth for full-year 2020 to decline 38%.


Stocks To Watch: Can Ping Retake Buy Point?
-------------------------------------------


Ping Identity formed a new base right after going public in September. It completed and broke out of that pattern in November, then eased back to form a second-stage base in January.


The new formation is a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 28.11 entry, with solid support along its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). Ping Identity is working on its third-straight up week, but keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just ahead of earnings. And as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and many other [top IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-levi-strauss-tencent-music-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/) have shown, newer IPOs can entail more risk.


Ping Identity popped Thursday to clear its 28.11 buy point. Volume was nearly double its daily average. But the stock reversed Friday, falling below the entry. Ping did managed to find support at its 10-day line and come off its lows for the day. It closed the week in positive territory for the week, with a 2.7% gain.

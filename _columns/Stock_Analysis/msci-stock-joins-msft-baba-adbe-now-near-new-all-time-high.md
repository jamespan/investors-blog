When you think of stocks with the best track records of strong and stable earnings growth, well-known names like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) come to mind. But what about **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI))?




Providing investment decision support tools to large institutions, MSCI is well-known among the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutuall-funds-invest-big-in-aapl-amzn-fb-nflx-googl-msft-adbe-zm-docu/), banks and other leading money managers. Not surprisingly, the New York-based company also made IBD's latest list of new buys by the top-performing funds.


MSCI stock also joins Microsoft, Adobe, Alibaba, Mastercard, and ServiceNow on [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). As the name implies, this proprietary list identifies companies with strength and resilience to weather temporary setbacks in the stock market.


One key factor is the earnings stability rating. MSCI sports a solid score of 3 (the lower the number, the more stable the earnings). MSCI's rating compares well to fellow long-term leaders like Microsoft (3), Adobe (6), Alibaba (5) and ServiceNow (7).


MSCI stock is once again showing its resilience as it recovers from the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) and closes in on a new 356.76 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

MSCI Driving ESG Investing
--------------------------


As a well-connected force on Wall Street, MSCI is a leading player in the world of [ESG investing](https://www.msci.com/what-is-esg), which refers to socially conscious environment, social and governance issues. As part of that drive, in May MSCI made public its MSCI ESG Fund Ratings for 36,000 multi-asset class mutual funds and ETFs. The company said ESG ratings and metrics are now available to anyone on the MSCI website as part of its "wider ESG transparency initiative to provide consistent and comparable ESG metrics at the company, fund and index level."


MSCI has been doing well by doing good. It's tied with **Envestnet** ([ENV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENV)) for the No. 1 ranking in the specialty financial services industry group with a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning it's outperforming 96% of all stocks for the most important stock-picking criteria. It sports a strong annual pretax profit margin on 43%.


Earnings growth has ranged from 14% to 37% over the last eight quarters.


MSCI Stock Trying To Finance New Breakout And All-Time High
-----------------------------------------------------------


MSCI ended the shortened week 4% shy of its potential new entry. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has come slightly off its 52-week high while consolidating, but the stock has found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


A new breakout by MSCI stock would also mark a new all-time high. In a sign of strength for the coronavirus stock market rebound, MSFT, ADBE, NOW and BABA are also trading at or near their all-time highs.

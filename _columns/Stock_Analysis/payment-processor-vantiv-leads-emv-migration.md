You’ve certainly noticed the shift from swiping your credit card at the register to making purchases by inserting a new type of card with an embedded chip. Vantiv is one of the key players driving that trend.


Known in the payment processing industry as the [EMV migration](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/vantiv-leads-personal-credit-economy/), merchants are adopting the new system that enhances security by using cards with chips that are nearly impossible to duplicate. EMV is  named after Europay, **MasterCard** ([MC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MC)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), the companies that developed the technology to address the fact that nearly half of [global credit card fraud](https://squareup.com/townsquare/emv/) occurs in the U.S.


Vantiv, which also supports NFC-based payment systems like Apple Pay from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and Android Pay from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), is a leader in the EMV migration, providing payment services to small, medium and large merchants, and producing the physical cards for financial institutions.


Earlier this month, Vantiv combined two of its subsidiaries, Mercury Payment Systems and Element Payment Services, into Vantiv Integrated Payments.


Last week, the newly-branded company announced Security Pays 2.0, an education and awareness initiative to drive adoption of additional security measures to the payments process, including end-to-end encryption, tokenization and EMV.


Top-Ranked Stock Within Payment Processing Group
------------------------------------------------


Vantiv’s 98 Composite Rating earns the No. 1 ranking within the Finance -- Credit Card/Payment Processing group, ahead of **Heartland Payment Systems** ([HPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPY)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)), and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)).


Vantiv, Euronet and Global Payments are all members of the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks.


On Feb. 3, Vantiv posted Q4 earnings growth of 23%, topping estimates for the fifth-straight report. Sales rose 16% over the year-ago quarter. For 2016, analysts expect EPS to rise 17%, followed by an 11% gain next year.


Will Vantiv Register New Breakout?
----------------------------------


Vantiv traces its roots back to 1971, but had its IPO in March 2012.


Since breaki[![Markup_VNTV](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Markup_VNTV-300x264.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Markup_VNTV.jpg)ng out of a long consolidation in May 2013, the stock has essentially doubled in price.


It’s now working on a second-stage cup that has shown more volatility than what was seen in prior months. Another yellow flag is that there have been more down weeks in heavy volume than up weeks in heavy trading within the base.


But on the positive side, the stock has found support at the 40-week moving average, and the 10-week line has stayed above its longer-term cousin. Also, the stock is on pace to close at the top of the price range for five out of the last six weeks, and the Relative Strength line has climbed into new high ground.


However, volume has been lagging. See if heavier trading kicks in as Vantiv nears a potential 53.56 entry. Look for volume to be at least 40% above average on the day of any attempted breakout.

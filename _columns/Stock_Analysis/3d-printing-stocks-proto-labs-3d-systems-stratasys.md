Before peaking in 2014, 3D printing stocks **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) and **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) were soaring and essentially printing money for investors. While both stocks have yet to recover from subsequent slumps, fellow 3D printing innovator **Proto Labs** ([PRLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRLB)) has been rising and has now molded a new breakout move.




3D Systems and Stratasys both manufacture and sell 3D printers, but Proto Labs has taken a fundamentally different approach. Instead of trying to sell the machines, the Minnesota-based firm offers 3D printing as a service.


Proto Labs focuses on rapid prototyping and on-demand production. Its technology can produce custom parts and assemblies in as little as one day with automated 3D printing, CNC machining, sheet metal fabrication, and injection-molding processes.


Clients come from a wide range of industries, including aerospace, medical and health care, robotics, electronics, and consumer products.


Proto Labs' services help customers like **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) and **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) accelerate product development and reduce their time to market. Rapid prototyping also helps clients minimize risk throughout the product life cycle.

No. 1-Ranked 3D Printing Stock
------------------------------


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), Proto Labs earns top billing in the materials handling and automation group. The score means Proto Labs is outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Stratasys has a lowly 13 Composite Rating, while 3D Systems has an also-unimpressive 38 rating.


Like 3D Systems and Stratasys, Proto Labs also went through some lean years in terms of sales and earnings growth. But its business model of selling 3D printing as a service has produced steadier gains in recent quarters.


Proto Labs has averaged 30% quarterly EPS growth over the last three reports. For the second quarter, analysts expect a 46% rise in earnings. Revenue gains have accelerated in each of the last three quarters, coming in at 34% in Q1.


By contrast, 3D Systems hasn't shown positive earnings growth since Q1 of 2017. Sales growth has been negative or in the single digits in each of the last eight quarters.


Stratasys has shown similar struggles in terms of sales. While Stratasys did show a nice rebound in earnings last year, growth slowed to a 7% gain in Q4 and 0% in the first quarter of 2018.


Testing New Breakout
--------------------


On Monday, Proto Labs cleared a 128.32 buy point in a second-stage flat base to close at 128.65. Volume was 24% above average.


Institutional demand for shares is mixed. The stock sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio, but the number of funds with a position in Proto Labs edged lower last quarter from 345 to 338.


On Wednesday, Proto Labs gave back earlier gains to close marginally down at 131.93. The buy zone extends to 134.74.


The relative strength line is floating right around new-high ground.



3D Systems has been rising sharply in recent weeks, but like Stratasys, it still faces a significant amount of overhead supply due to its multiyear decline.

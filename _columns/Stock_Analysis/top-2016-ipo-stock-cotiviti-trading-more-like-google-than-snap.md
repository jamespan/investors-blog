Unlike the big-buzz IPOs from **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) that quickly headed south, the less-covered 2016 initial public offering from **Cotiviti** ([COTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COTV)) has followed the same type of sharp rise Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) had right after its 2004 market debut.









 
 
 While Snap has continued to sink, Alibaba has come back with a vengeance after a multiyear slump that started soon after its 2014 IPO.
Known as Google when it went public, Alphabet quickly formed an IPO base and soared 180% in less than a year. Similarly, Cotiviti broke out of its own IPO base just weeks after it started trading in May 2016, soaring 114% in just 11 months. Now Cotiviti may now be getting ready to break out again.


No. 1 Stock With 233% EPS Growth
--------------------------------


Cotiviti is a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions, counting 20 of the top 25 U.S. health care payers and eight of the nation's top 10 retailers as clients.


While helping companies reduce waste and avoid paying fraudulent claims, Cotiviti has generated a three-year EPS growth rate of 233% and a 27.5% annual pretax profit margin.


The Atlanta-based company earns the No. 1 spot among its peers in the Commercial Services-Health Care industry group, which ranks No. 18 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Institutional demand is reflected in the stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership.


Healthy Breakout Ahead?
-----------------------


Cotiviti has been working on a cup without handle with a 43.09 buy point.


After a sharp sell-off in the left side of the pattern, the stock has shown signs of technical strength and accumulation in the right side of the base, recapturing its 50-day line in heavy volume as its relative strength line heads sharply higher.



Another positive sign is how the 10-day moving average has climbed back above the 50-day line.


When this story was originally published on Thursday, Cotiviti was still trading below the buy point, but that changed on Friday. The stock rose over 4% for the day and more than 9% for the week to jump into buy range. Friday's volume was over 80% higher than normal, well above the 40% or greater spike you look for on the day of a breakout.

The Internet of Things (IOT) and cloud computing revolution won't just deliver self-driving cars from **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). It might just save your life – with digital health care solutions delivered by medical tech firms like **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)).


Based in Pennsylvania, BioTelemetry bills itself as "the leading wireless medical technology company focused on the delivery of health information to improve quality of life and reduce cost of care."


The company allows health care providers to wirelessly monitor and diagnose a patient's health using a lineup of products focused on mobile cardiac telemetry, event monitoring and self-monitoring.


The appeal of BioTelemetry's 238% three-year annual EPS growth rate helped earn it a spot on IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/new-buys-of-top-mutual-funds-burlington-stores-drew-industries/), but note that earnings growth has slowed from triple-digit gains to a still strong 67% and 62% in Q2 and Q3, respectively.


The stock is now within striking distance of a new breakout.


No. 1 Among Medical Services Stocks
-----------------------------------


While the medical services industry groups ranks a lowly 172 out of 197 groups, BioTelemetry's 95 Composite Rating earns it the top spot among its industry peers. **Psychemedics** ([PMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PMD)), **VCA** ([WOOF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOOF)), **Quest Diagnostics** ([DGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DGX)) and **Healthways** ([HWAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWAY)) round out the top five.


BioTelemetry made two acquisitions in April: VirtualScopics, which will expand BioTelemetry's clinical research offerings, and the ePatch Division of DELTA Danish Electronics, Light and Acoustics, which it had previously partnered with to develop BioTelemetry's next generation MCOT (Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry) Patch device.


On Dec. 1, BioTelemetry announced it will buy Telcare Medical Supply, increasing its presence in the fast-growing digital population health management market.


Reset Button
------------


BioTelemetry reset its base count in November, making its current cup pattern a lower risk first-stage consolidation.



The stock has been trading right along its 10-day line as it approaches the 21.78 entry. An A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to demand for the stock.


On Friday, BioTelemetry rose early, but came up just pennies shy of a breakout before pulling back slightly and closing about 1.3% higher for the day. The stock has now posted six consecutive up weeks.

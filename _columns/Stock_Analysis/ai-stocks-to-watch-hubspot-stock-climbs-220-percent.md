When investing in stocks, you not only need to understand what type of investor you are. You also need to understand the "personality" of your stocks. **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), one of the top [AI stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/), has proved to be a stair-stepper. Rather than dashing higher to big and sudden gains, HubSpot stock has taken gradual steps to a more-than-220% climb from February 2017 to May 2019.




The provider of an artificial intelligence-driven, cloud-based marketing and sales platform jumped into a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Thursday, but closed just below it on Friday. The jump came as [HubSpot beat on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hubspot-stock-earnings-hubs-q219/) Aug. 6, delivering a sixth straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth.


With a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), HubSpot ranks No. 3 among its peers in the specialty enterprise software group. The rating means HubSpot is outpacing 96% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). The stock was also just [added to the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-watchlists-add-17-stocks-hubspot-dr-horton/). (Check daily updates to see which companies just came [on and off IBD's top watchlists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/best-growth-stocks-buy-watch-ibd-stock-lists/).)


**Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) hold the No. 1 and No. 2 spot, respectively.

AI Stocks To Watch: HubSpot Stock Pops Into Buy Zone
----------------------------------------------------


You can clearly see the stair-stepping action of HubSpot stock in its [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/). Such movement occurs when a stock repeatedly goes back and forth through periods of [support and resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


After breaking out of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) base on Aug. 23, 2018, HubSpot stock pulled back enough to [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) by undercutting the low in that double-bottom formation.


Since then, the stock has continued to display its familiar stair-stepping action. HubSpot has made a couple of minor pauses in recent months, soon finding support around its 50-day line each time.


After a sharp drop below that key benchmark as the general market sold off sharply for a few days from late July to early August, HubSpot also fell in heavy volume. But as the general market has shown signs of a rebound, HubSpot has also recovered. But uncertaintly in the overall market puts that rebound in question.


HubSpot has risen sharply in heavy volume in recent days, retaking its 50-day line along the way. HubSpot has also retaken its 192.59 buy point and is now trading within the buy zone, which extends to 202.22. The stock ended Thursday's session up 5% at 196.23. Volume was 43% higher than normal. Also note that the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has a new 52-week high, a sign of market-leading strength.


On Friday, HubSpot failed to close above the buy point, falling 2.4% to close at 191.53. Volume was lighter than on the strong gains HubSpot made earlier in the week.


Keep in mind that the overall [stock market outlook](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/) remains "market in correction." That can switch back into "confirmed market uptrend" very quickly, but the indexes have not yet signaled the start of a new rally. Before buying back into the market, it's best to wait for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to flash the green light that a potential new uptrend has begun.

Ohio-based **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) rounds out the top five stocks among discount retailers, behind **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)). The group ranked No. 47 among the 197 industries IBD tracks on Friday.


While Five Below, Dollar Tree and Dollar General have all broken out recently, Big Lots and Ollie's are still working on new bases.


Big Lots operates 1,447 locations in 47 states, offering brand-name merchandise at prices that are, according the company, up to 70% lower than traditional retailers and 20% to 40% below most discount stores.


On the downside, its three-year annual growth rates for earnings (1%) and sales (-1%) are also much lower than several rivals, including Ollie's Bargain Outlet (59%, 19%), Five Below (27%, 25%) and Dollar General (11%, 8%).


But Big Lots may be on the rebound, with two consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including an estimate-beating 34% gain for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, ended April 30. Big Lots is expected to report Q2 numbers toward the end of August.


Analysts see EPS rising 15% this fiscal year, followed by a 12% gain in fiscal 2017. Analysts have revised their estimates for both years higher.


Support Vs. Resistance
----------------------


Big Lots spiked nearly 17% the week ended May 27 on earnings, pushing it above a cup-with-handle buy point. It soon pulled back, but found support above the prior entry and at the 10-week moving average.


The stock is now working on a flat base, but hit resistance at the 53.45 entry on Wednesday and fell lower again on Thursday.


If Big Lots continues to pull back, look for volume to lighten up. If the stock manages to clear the buy point, look for volume to be at least 40% above average on the day of the breakout.

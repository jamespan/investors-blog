Boosted by four straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, cloud-based accounting software provider **BlackLine** ([BL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BL)) has jumped into a new buy zone.




The move comes after BL stock has already risen as much as 539% since its 2016 IPO.


BlackLine joins **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **SiteOne Landscape Supply** ([SITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SITE)) among the [best IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) from the class of 2016.


As impressive as the run for BlackLine has been, its fellow 2016 IPO stocks have risen even more. TTD stock holds the class crown with a gain of 3,524% since the low of its stock market debut. Twilio stock (1,594%), Innovative Industrial stock (1,359%) and SiteOne stock (603%) also show the potential of [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-ipo-stocks-lessons-from-facebook-snap/) showing [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).

(The latest report comes out later today.)

BlackLine Breaks Out Ahead Of Q4 Earnings
-----------------------------------------


With earnings due in a week, BlackLine has cleared a 141.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). BL stock is now trading at the top of the buy zone, which extends to 149.02.

In a sign of stock market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) for BlackLine has risen sharply. The RS line is currently just below a new 52-week high.


With the exception of a brief drop below the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) in August, note also how BL stock has consistently found support at that key benchmark line since recovering from the coronavirus crash in March and April of last year.

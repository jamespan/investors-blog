**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has been in the news even more than normal recently. It launched the iPhone 6 in September, selling more than 10 million units in its first weekend. Forbes reported sales may have already eclipsed the 21 million mark.

  

Apple also recently announced Apple Watch, expected to hit stores in early 2015.

  

On Thursday, activist investor Carl Icahn wrote an open letter to CEO Tim Cook, saying Apple was "dramatically undervalued" and should be trading around $200 a share, about double its current price. Icahn encouraged Apple to speed up its stock buyback program.

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After a sharp slowdown in 2012 and 2013, Apple's earnings growth has bounced back, rising from 5% to 20% over the past three quarters. Sales growth has been less impressive, but inched higher from 5% to 6% in the latest report.

  

Apple is expected to report its most recent quarterly numbers Oct. 20.

  

The company sports a strong 31% return on equity and 99 Composite Rating. Its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate buying over the last 13 weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After peaking in September 2012, Apple spent more than a year forming a long cup with handle, then went sideways for another four months before perking up in April.

  

Since then, it's made a nice, steady climb in tight trading, with good support along its 10-week line.

  

It's now trading right around the old high it hit back in 2012 and is six weeks into a flat base, with a buy point of 103.84.

  

The Relative Strength line is in new high ground, a sign of leadership in a weak market.

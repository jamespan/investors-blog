Like fellow [IBD 50 stock](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), weight loss program provider **Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)) is near a potential buy point ahead of Q3 earnings. Nutrisystem reports on Oct. 25 and Facebook is on deck for Nov. 1.









 
 
 Several other IBD 50 stocks, including **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) are also among the [stocks in or near a buy zone ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).
The question now is, will Nutrisystem, Facebook and others head south on earnings or soar like **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL))? It's that uncertainty surrounding earnings season that makes it risky to buy a stock just before it reports.


Note that Nutrisystem is among [10 IBD 50 stocks expecting 50%-or-higher earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/q3-earnings-preview-stocks-expecting-50-plus-growth/) in their next report.


Nutrisystem Vs. Weight Watchers, Herbalife
------------------------------------------


A quick look at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows Nutrisystem earns top ranking in the Cosmetics/Personal Care industry group with a 94 Composite Rating, ahead of weight management rival **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)), which earns a score of 83.


**Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) and **Weight Watchers International** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)) both have Composite Ratings of 65, putting them in a tie for the No. 8 slot within the group.


One reason for the lower ratings is that both Herbalife and Weight Watchers have shown erratic and sometimes nonexistent earnings growth in recent quarters.


But both companies have shown signs of rebounding fundamentals, and Weight Watchers' stock has risen sharply in recent months and is now working on a new base.


Herbalife's share price jumped over 11% on Oct. 6, but the stock has since pulled back and fallen sharply below that earlier buy point.


Weight Watchers is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 1, followed by Herbalife on Nov. 2 and Medifast on Nov. 7.


In contrast to its industry peers, Nutrisystem has shown steadier and more-solid growth. Earnings gains have ranged from 30% to 53% over the last six quarters, while revenue growth has ranged from 15% to 31% during the same period.


Longer term, Nutrisystem's three-year annual growth rates for earnings (42%) and sales (18%) soundly beat those for Herbalife (-7%, -4%), Weight Watchers (-32%, -10%) and Medifast (0%, -3%).


Cup With Love Handle?
---------------------


Nutrisystem is forming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) showing a 60.90 buy point. The left side of the pattern began forming on July 27 when the stock reversed sharply in heavy volume after reporting Q2 earnings.



But the stock managed to find support around the 10-week line and build the right side of the base. The relative strength line is within striking distance of new-high territory and, in a sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day line has moved back above the [50-day moving](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) average.


On Tuesday, Nutrisystem was down around 0.8% to 58.25 and closed just below the 10-day line. Weight Watchers was up over 2% to 46.45, putting it within 3% of a 48.10 entry in a later stage base. Herbalife was down more than 1%.


Look for Nutrisystem to break out in volume at least 40% above average, and be sure to check how the company reports tomorrow.

Double-digit earnings growth and a top-notch rating make **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) one of the best stocks to watch in the apparel retail group.




It's also poised for a potential breakout from a powerful pattern. Burlington shares are about 3% away from a 209.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) that's part of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/base-on-base-breakout-yield-big-gains/). The pattern is first stage â€” and leading stocks often make their biggest advance out of such early stage bases.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) assigns the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock a 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines key fundamental and technical metrics into a single score. That puts it among the best stocks in the 41-stock apparel and shoe retail group, along with **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)).



Burlington's 94 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/), which goes into the composite score, reflects a five-year earnings growth rate of 38%. Analysts expect 12% profit growth for fiscal 2020 ending in January, and a 14% increase in 2021. The clothing chain lost money in 2012, but has delivered double-digit EPS growth every year since.


An A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-stock-market-rally-use-smr-rating-growth-stocks/) (which measures sales, profit margins and return on equity) means Burlington is in the top 20% of all stocks based on those gauges. Pretax margin rose to its highest level in fiscal 2019. Sales growth over the past three quarters averaged 7%. Analysts expect about a 9% sales gain for the current fiscal year ending in January and another 9% the next.


Top Funds Like It Too
---------------------


On the technical front, a 93 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) means Burlington stock has outperformed 93% of all other stocks. An A- [Accumulation/Distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) Rating points to more recent net buying vs. selling by mutual funds. Highly regarded funds including Fidelity Balanced Fund (FBALX) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) owned shares in Q3.


Burlington Stores started selling off-price coats and outerwear in 1972 out of a store in Burlington, N.J. It now has 691 stores in 45 stores and Puerto Rico, and has vastly expanded its offerings.

As fellow heavy machinery powerhouse **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) excavates a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), equipment rival and Dow Jones component **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) is mining for an entry of its own. CAT stock dug up a [double-bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/getting-the-dub-recognizing-the-double-bottom-base-pattern/) while Deere is exploring a breakout from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) base.




Both companies lead their respective [industry groups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


Caterpillar tops the Machinery-Construction/Mining group, with a 95 [Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) while Deere's 98 rating outpaces its peers in the Machinery-Farm group.


CAT stock also outcompetes DE in recent earnings growth and upcoming estimates.


In Q3, it posted 48% EPS growth compared with Deere's 16% increase. That said, Deere beats its rival in current-quarter estimates, with Wall Street forecasting 73% EPS growth vs. Caterpillar's still-strong 44%.


For the full year, analysts see CAT stock growing earnings by 26%, narrowly topping Deere's 20% projection.


Strong Demand For CAT Stock
---------------------------


How can you gauge demand for a stock?


One way is to check the "Supply And Demand" section of [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-caterpillar-cat.aspx).


Caterpillar sports an B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Both metrics point to demand among large investors.


While it did not join Deere on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-focus-cash-on-these-medical-financial-and-energy-stocks/), 75 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported a position in CAT stock.


An even better way to spot demand is to check the price and [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) action in the [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/).


As CAT stock approached its latest buy point, it posted several weeks of heavy, well-above-average trade. This bullish action reveals strong buying interest by institutional investors.


Also note how Caterpillar's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has surged to a new high in a clear sign of market leadership. While Deere's RS line has also hit a new high, its weekly volume has not been quite as strong.


Look at the daily and weekly charts, along with IBD Stock Checkup, to further evaluate and compare Deere vs. Caterpillar.


Caterpillar Uncovers Multiple Buy Points
----------------------------------------


CAT stock has carved the outline of a lopsided [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 232.45 buy point.


Many stock charts can be interpreted in different ways. For example, this pattern can also be viewed as a potential cup pattern with a 238 buy point. It also can be seen as a double bottom with a 200.47 entry, though CAT is extended from it now.


When buying stocks, you want to take exposure as close as possible to the earliest valid entry. In the current environment, Caterpillar's 232.45 double-bottom buy point is the place to look for an entry. The stock is above that level, and on Friday climbed above the 238 cup entry as well.


Meanwhile, Deere has constructed a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) showing a 406.12 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). On Friday, it climbed above the entry.


For both stocks, investors should keep a close eye on price and volume around the buy point, as well as how the broad [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) are performing.

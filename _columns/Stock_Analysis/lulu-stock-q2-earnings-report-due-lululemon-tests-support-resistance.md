After rising 183% from a [three-weeks-tight breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is now testing areas of [support and resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) as it gets ready to report earnings on Sept. 5. Will LULU stock manage to stretch our additional gains?




LULU stock currently holds the No. 1 ranking among [clothing and accessories stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) with a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)), **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)), **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) also earn a spot among the industry leaders. While the group ranks a lowly No. 108 out of 197 industries IBD tracks, several industry leaders are [in or near new buy zones](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/).


In addition to Lululemon, fellow retailers TJX, Ross Stores and Burlington Stores may also be setting up potential new [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But like most stocks Friday, these leading retailers also fell on news surrounding China and the Federal Reserve.

Lululemon Faces Q2 Earnings Test
--------------------------------


While [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) always entails risk, LULU stock does have some positive indicators heading into its Sept. 5 report for fiscal 2019 Q2.


Analysts expect the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company to deliver 25% EPS growth for the quarter, and a 21% increase for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2020, annual earnings growth is expected to rise 19%.


Lululemon sports a solid 22% annual pretax profit margin and 34% annual return on equity. A 1.5 up/down volume ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership point to [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) for LULU stock.

Can LULU Stock Find Support And Clear Resistance?
-------------------------------------------------


Lululemon broke out from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in June. The stock managed to rise a little over 8%, but then pulled back and fell below its 50-day line in early August.


Since then LULU stock has fluctuated between spurts of support and signs of resistance. The stock is currently trading just below its 50-day moving average.


As Lululemon approaches its earning test, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trading just shy of a new 52-week high.


Note that it's always risky to buy stocks just before they report quarterly results. For investors considering a new purchase, it's best to keep your powder dry and see if the upcoming earnings release pushes the stock past the area of resistance in heavy volume — or if LULU stock hits a ceiling and retreats.


On Friday as the general market sold off, Lululemon fell over 2%, but managed to find support at  its buy point. See if the market can rebound and Lululemon can retake its 50-day benchmark.

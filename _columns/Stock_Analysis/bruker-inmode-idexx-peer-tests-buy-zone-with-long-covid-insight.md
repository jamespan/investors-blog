While Covid-19 vaccines fight the pandemic, medical research firm **Bruker** ([BRKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKR)) continues to tackle the issues of so-called "long-Covid." The **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) industry peer is testing a new buy zone. Bruker announced its latest insights into the longer-term effects of the coronavirus.




On May 20, Bruker announced discoveries from a [clinical research collaboration on Covid-19](https://www.bruker.com/en/news-and-events/news/2021/bruker-molecular-phenomics-research-tools-enable-new-insights-into-long-covid.html). The company discovered transient and persistent systemic changes of the molecular signatures in patient blood samples three months after acute Covid-19 clinical trials.


Bruker said these biochemical abnormalities relate to ongoing 'long Covid' symptoms. These long-term effects are characterized by persistent symptoms and health dysfunction after the acute infection.


The study was done with the [Australian National Phenome Centre](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/research/anpc). Bruker said in a news release that "post-acute follow-up studies on non-hospitalized and mildly affected Covid-19 patients revealed that the majority of these patients are not back to normal health."


The Massachusetts-based company added that "more than 57% of these patients show one or more symptoms up to six months following the acute phase."


Bruker Joins InMode, Idexx Among Top Medical Research Stocks
------------------------------------------------------------


Earning a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), InMode scores the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/).


While not highlighted on these [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), Bruker has a 93 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 93% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). Idexx earns a 96 overall rating.


Bruker has seen solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), indicated by 40 funds with an A+ rating from IBD taking a position in BRKR stock. Plus, the medical research firm sports a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and a strong 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/).


One factor driving demand is Bruker's strong fundamental performance. Last quarter, the company delivered 214% earnings growth, bringing its average EPS increases over the last three reports to 73%.


Although Bruker doesn't make a new IBD screen for the [fastest-growing stocks for Q2](https://www.investors.com/research/fastest-growing-stocks-q2-earnings-estimates/), analysts expect the company to deliver a 67% gain in the second quarter and a 39% EPS increase for the year.


On the sales front, after slumping for most of 2020, Bruker has now generated three quarters of improving revenue growth, including a 31% spike in Q1.


BRKR Stock, Idexx Test Buy Zone As InMode Sets Up
-------------------------------------------------


After bolting off its coronavirus lows in March 2020, InMode has continued to find support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). INMD stock has now retaken that benchmark line as it works on a new consolidation.


Idexx is trying to breakout past a 561.62 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Meanwhile, Bruker has been testing a 70.02 buy point in a cup shape base since mid-April. Still just below its 52-week high, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has been moving sideways, showing it's in line with the general market, represented by the S&P 500.


Look for the RS line to trend higher and volume pick up as Bruker tries to break decisively through resistance around the buy point.

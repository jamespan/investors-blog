Faced with a market sell-off to ring in the new year, do FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — still have what it takes to bite back?


To gauge the health of these and other leading names, see if they regain support — or continue to hit resistance — around their key moving average lines.


**![ISA_AMZN_011116b](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ISA_AMZN_011116b.jpg)Facebook:** On Jan. 4, the social media giant opened 2016 by falling below its 10-week line in volume 55% above average. After trying to rebound for a couple of days, it dropped again, closing nearly 5% lower as trading spiked 85%. But on Friday, the stock showed signs of potential support by closing well off its lows.


With its relative strength line still hovering just below new-high ground, see if Facebook can find support and quickly retake its 10-week moving average.


**Amazon:** After getting back above its 10-week line last January, the e-commerce and cloud giant stayed above it while rising 118% for the year.


But that trend ended last week as the stock fell sharply below the line in heavy trading. As with Facebook, Amazon's 2016 growth outlook remains strong, and its 10-week line is still well above its 40-week moving average. (Compare it with the chart for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


The question now is: Will fund managers step in to protect their positions, or will they switch into selling mode?


**Netflix:** The leader in online video streaming had the most impressive rebound among FANG stocks last week, rising 9% Wednesday in heavy trading. But it's still meeting resistance at the 10-week line.


**Alphabet:** As with its fellow Internet icons, it's not yet clear if Alphabet's 10-week moving average will become a ceiling of resistance or return to being a floor of support. So continue to compare upside vs. downside volume, and see if the stock quickly rebounds or starts "living" below the moving average.

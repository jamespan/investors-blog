After a 12% decline in early November, **Oshkosh** ([OSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSK)) is building a cup-with-handle base with a 93.20 buy point. Shares of the specialty truck maker were about 2% away from the entry in Friday's trading.









 
 
  Truck stocks came under pressure last month after **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) unveiled its new [Tesla Semi](https://www.investors.com/news/truck-stocks-slammed-as-tesla-semi-draws-retail-shipping-interest/), an electric truck that could get as many as 500 miles on a single battery charge.
Despite a number of [pre-orders](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/tesla-receives-largest-order-for-big-rig-semi-truck-from-ups/) for the Tesla Semi, truck stocks have mostly shrugged off those demand concerns. In fact, a [number of them](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/truck-stocks-set-up-buy-points-despite-tesla-semi-investing-action-plan/) are in the process of forming new bases with proper buy points.


In the most recent quarter, Oshkosh's year-over-year earnings grew 31%, while revenue increased 12% vs. the year-ago period. Looking forward, analysts expect the truck maker's earnings to grow 7% in fiscal-year 2018, which ends in September, and another 14% in fiscal-year 2019.


While Oshkosh's biggest revenue generator is its access equipment segment with $834 million of revenue in the most recent quarter, Oshkosh is seeing its highest quarterly growth in its defense segment. Revenue from defense rose 27% year over year in the latest quarter.



A previous base-on-base breakout on Sept. 18 led to a nice 22% gain, allowing investors to lock in a solid gain at the 20%-25% [profit-taking level](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/), just ahead of the company's earnings release. Investors with high levels of conviction could have held through the earnings release, which ended up beating the Street's estimates.


Yet over the next two weeks, the midcap stock would decline as much as 12% before it found much-needed support at its 50-day line, as it shaped the right side of a potential base. Now — seven weeks later — the stock is putting the finishing touches on a cup-with-handle base with a 93.20 entry.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Oshkosh has an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating strong institutional demand.

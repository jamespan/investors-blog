With a 99 Composite Rating, **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) is outpacing 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important stock picking criteria.


Technically, Trex is considered a third-stage base because it didn't quite undercut the low in its prior pattern. But the Virginia-based company has the feel of a [base count reset](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) after going through a long 54-week consolidation that gave the stock a chance to regroup.


Other leaders in the building products industry group — **Atkore International** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)), **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)), and **James Hardie** ([JHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JHX)) — have tightened up in an attempt to form new consolidations.


The group now ranks No. 15 among the [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-stock-market-winners-watch-changing-industry-group-power/), up from No. 30 six months ago.

Trex Stock Decks Out New Growth Prospects
-----------------------------------------


Like resanding an old deck and giving it a fresh paint job, Trex has refurbished its growth prospects in recent months. The stock has bounced back from two quarters of slowing earnings growth to a 26% gain in Q3. The company has also revamped sales growth from a flat Q2 to a 17% gain last quarter.


Analysts expect earnings to rise 3% when Trex reports full-year numbers next month, then rise to 22% in 2020.


Trex stock continues to show solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/). The stock has posted eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership and a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/). Plus, 98 funds with an A+ rating own shares in the maker of wood-alternative decking, railing and fencing products.


Tighter Trading May Spring Trex Stock Higher
--------------------------------------------


After consolidating for more than a year starting in September 2018, Trex is now forming a tighter flat base with a 93.73 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). While forming that pattern, Trex has been testing — and finding — support right along its 10-week line.


The relative strength line remains below its 52-week high, but in a positive sign on a technical rebound, the 10-day moving average has climbed back above the 50-day line. It's healthy action when a shorter-term benchmark moves back above a long-term line.


On Friday, Trex bounced off its lows for the day to end in positive territory and retake its 10-day and 50-day moving averages. It's now 5% below the buy point.

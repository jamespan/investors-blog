In a sign of how fast a stock's picture can change, **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) went from a promising base to a sell signal.

  

The stock had been finding support at its 10-week moving average as it formed a base starting in early May 1.

  

But it had flashed hesitation on June 1, when shares reversed lower after nearing the prior high. The stock again faced resistance around 92 on June 3.

  

Since the overall market was in a correction, that was something to keep an eye on, because it could have indicated emerging selling among institutional investors.

  

The selling became obvious on Monday, as the stock plunged through its 10-week line in the largest one-day drop since the start of its run 2. That's a pretty clear sell signal.

  

Volume swelled, a sign to lock in at least some gains if you owned shares from an earlier breakout. For those shareholders, profits may still exist since the stock remains above the 75.24 buy point from the March 28 breakout 3.

  

Selling has continued this week,casting serious doubts on MercadoLibre's basing attempt.

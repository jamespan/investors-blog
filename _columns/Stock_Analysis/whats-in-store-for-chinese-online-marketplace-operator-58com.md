Today we'll look at **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)), which went public in October. Based in China with a business model similar to the better-known craigslist, it operates an online marketplace for local merchants and consumers through its 58.com website.

  

Through the marketplace, merchants offer a wide range of new and used goods, as well as job listings, entertainment and other services. Consumers in approximately 380 cities then search the site to find what they need.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

58.com has posted four straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. However, those gains are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that had negative or no earnings growth, which makes it easier for the company to post large percentage increases.

  

Sales growth has also been strong, with four straight quarters of accelerating gains, including a jump from 83% to 103% in Q1.

  

The company has not yet announced when it will report second quarter numbers.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 76%, followed by a 134% rise in 2015.

  

58.com sports an outstanding 59% return on equity, helping it earn an SMR Rating of A.

  

The company's 99 Composite Rating ranks No. 1 among the 31 stocks in the Retail-Internet industry group.

  

While the the number of funds that own shares slipped from 113 to 106 in the latest report, there have been other signs of institutional demand.

  

58.com's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B indicates moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks, and its 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio also points to professional interest in the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public last October, 58.com more than doubled over the next 19 weeks. Trading was somewhat choppy and volatile, but the stock generally found support at its 10-week line.

  

After reaching an all time high of 58.89 in March, the stock hit resistance and pulled back to begin forming its current base, a first-stage cup-with-handle. The initial pullback came on news 58.com would announce a secondary offering. Investor's did not take the news well, and the stock fell below its 10-week like on above-average volume.

  

After several failed attempts to get back above that benchmark, the stock finally succeeded in June and began forming the right side of its base.

  

The first down week in the handle came on volume 19% higher than normal, but trading lightened up the following week and came in well below average. The stock also found support above its 10-week line.

  

The ideal buy point is 57.60, 10 cents above the peak in the handle. See if the stock can break past that price on volume at least 40% - 50% higher than normal. But also keep an eye out for any changes in overall market direction and see what kind of numbers 58.com reports for Q2.

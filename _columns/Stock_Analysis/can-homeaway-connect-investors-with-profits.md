Today we're going to look at **HomeAway** ([AWAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AWAY)), which connects tourists with people who want to rent out their vacation properties.

  

It runs web sites under the HomeAway name, as well as VacationRentals.com, VRBO.com and BedandBreakfast.com.

  

The firm was profiled in a Feb. 26 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/022513-645631-homeaway-shares-surge-on-q4-results.htm), which notes HomeAway has become the world's leading online marketplace for vacation rentals.

  

Competitors include smaller outfits and also larger online travel sites like **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)).

  

But analysts say that it's HomeAway's tiered pricing system that has been a big driver of recent growth in listings revenue.

  

The pricing system offers owners more options and better search rankings for their properties for additional fees.

  

**Key Company Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth has been accelerating — in fact earnings were up 100% in the fourth quarter. Those results came out late last month and, as we'll see in a minute, the stock got a nice boost that day.

  

• Sales growth ranged from 20% to 22% the past three quarters, which is a little less than the 25% minimum historically seen in winning growth stocks.

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 33% in 2013 and 23% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

HomeAway has the best Composite Rating in its Leisure-Travel Booking industry group, according to [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-homeaway-inc-away.aspx). So it's the leader.

  

Expedia is ranked No. 2 in the group and Priceline is ranked No. 3.

  

The industry group itself is ranked No. 110 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

HomeAway came public in July 2011, then gradually drifted south and sideways for more than a year.

  

Recently the stock carved out a cup-shaped base, as you can see in the MarketSmith chart above.

  

It broke out of that pattern Feb. 21, scoring a hefty price gain in the wake of those fourth-quarter earnings results we mentioned earlier.

  

It's now too far extended past its ideal buy point to get into safely. But it may be one to keep on your watch list.

  

Here's something else to keep in mind about earnings reports: they can cut both ways.

  

Though HomeAway got a big leg up from its latest report, it was different from the previous time they released results in Nov. That time around earnings topped estimates, but its forecast disappointed investors who sent the stock tumbling below the 50-day line.

  

And that underscores the danger of buying a stock close to the time it will be releasing results. So that's also something to factor into your trading.

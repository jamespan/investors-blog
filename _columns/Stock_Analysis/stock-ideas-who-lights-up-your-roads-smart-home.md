When industries experience revolutionary change, you want to see which stocks are driving the revolution. When it comes to the lighting industry and increasing demand for energy-efficient, interconnected products, **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) has been a beacon for change — which is one reason why the stock just broke out into a new buy zone.

  

The Atlanta-based firm provides LED, OLED (organic LED) and other lighting solutions for indoor and outdoor applications. And with its recent purchase of Distech Controls, Acuity is well-positioned to profit from the rise of smart homes and IoT-driven connectivity.

  

Competitors in the lighting space include **Eaton** ([ETN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETN)), **Philips** ([PHG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHG)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Sales growth has been solid and steady, ranging from 12% to 15% over the last seven quarters.

  

Earnings growth has come in above the 25% minimum that [CAN SLIM investors](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) look for in each of a stock's last four quarters.

  

On Oct. 7, Acuity beat analyst estimates for both the top and bottom lines when it reported numbers for its fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 31.

  

Estimates for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 have recently been raised higher.

  

Acuity sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, and fund ownership has been on the rise in recent quarters. Plus, five typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons and Fidelity Contrafund .

  

The Building — Construction Products industry group currently ranks No. 18, and Acuity's 98 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 slot among its peers, behind **Fortune Brands Home & Security** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)).

  

The group also includes **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)), **Apogee Enterprises** ([APOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOG)) and **Mohawk Industries** ([MHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHK)).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a bumpy ride in a 43-week long consolidation, Acuity broke out on earnings in January. From there, it climbed steadily higher in tight trading right along the 10-week line.

  

In August, the stock pulled back to form a second-stage double bottom.

  

It found support at the 40-week line and quickly recaptured the 10-week moving average when it reported fiscal Q3 earnings and soared over 13%.

  

The standard buy point is 204.52, 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the W. But Acuity also formed a handle, giving an earlier entry of 202.30.

  

The stock cleared both buy points on Oct. 21, but volume came in just 22% above average, not quite meeting the 40% or higher spike that investors prefer to see.

  

Trading has continued to be tepid, so see if heavier volume starts to kick in.

  

The buying range for a breakout is up to 5% above the ideal buy point. During Thursday's session, Acuity was still just within the buy zone.

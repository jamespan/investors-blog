**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) may be king of cloud services and e-commerce, but its dreams of taking on **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) in online travel just got shipwrecked.

  

Last week, the tech giant pulled the plug on its Destinations travel site, which launched in April.

  

How did Priceline investors react? On Monday, they pushed the stock to an all-time high and past a 1,395.10 buy point in an early stage base.

  

In addition to Priceline.com, its flagship hotel and air travel site, the Connecticut-based company's other brands include Booking.com, Kayank.com, Agoda.com, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable.com, an online restaurant reservations service.

  

Priceline is the overall top-rated leader among its peers in the Leisure-Travel Booking group, which currently ranks No. 20 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.

  

No. 4 ranked **TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) has been a long-time partner with Priceline, and earlier this month the two companies announced a new strategic alliance. Priceline's online travel brands will now participate in TripAdvisor's instant booking platform.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Earnings growth has slowed recently, but Priceline is expected to post its best profit gain in three quarter when it reports Nov. 9.

  

The company sports a strong 37% return on equity and 39% annual EPS growth rate.

  

Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership last quarter.

  

Also note that six typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons and Fidelity Contrafund .

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

One of the keys to reading stock charts is to identify [areas of resistance](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/how-to-read-stock-charts-support-and-resistance/).

  

A look at Priceline's weekly chart shows that the stock has found resistance just under the 1,400 mark since February 2014. So for the stock to launch a new climb, it first needs to punch through that ceiling.

  

And on Monday, it did.

  

After closing higher for four consecutive weeks in the right side of the base, it cleared a 1,395.10 buy point as the Relative Strength line moved into new high ground, a bullish sign for a breakout.

  

The buying range is up to 5% above the ideal buy point. For Priceline, that's from 1395.10 to 1,464.86.

  

During Tuesday's session, it was still trading within that range.

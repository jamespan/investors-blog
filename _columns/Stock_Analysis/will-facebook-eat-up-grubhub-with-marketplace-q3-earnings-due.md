Tech titans **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) have a seemingly insatiable appetite for entering new businesses, from virtual reality and self-driving cars to space travel and robotic-assisted surgery.


But unlike Alphabet's famous "moonshot" projects, Facebook's latest ventures are less revolutionary, but potentially more profitable, including the launching of Marketplace, an online platform to facilitate the local buying and selling of goods and services.


Tied to that [deeper push into e-commerce](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/facebook-flexes-e-commerce-muscle-with-food-tickets-quotes/), Facebook also now allows users to order food from their Facebook Pages.


Who has the most to fear from the latest Facebook forays?


Marketplace poses a threat to **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) and Craigslist, while its food-ordering service could turn up the heat on fellow IBD 50 member **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)).


**No. 1 Rank Among Internet Rivals**
------------------------------------


Facebook's 99 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 rank within the Internetâ€“Content industry group, ahead of GrubHub, **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and Google-parent Alphabet.


The social media giant also sports solid three-year annual growth rates for earnings (64%) and sales (52%).


Facebook is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 2 and analysts expect the company to maintain strong growth.


Both Facebook and Weibo made IBD's recent list of [top-rated stocks expected to post 50%-plus growth in Q3](https://www.investors.com/news/q3-earnings-preview-which-stocks-expect-50-or-higher-growth-2/).


**Steady Climb Or Stalling Breakout?**
--------------------------------------


With eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership and a 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio, Facebook earns a "like" when it comes to [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


But the stock has been more of a steady climber than a fast mover in recent years. And several breakout attempts since 2014 have either stumbled or stalled.



While Facebook has shown long-term support at both its 10-week and 40-week moving average lines, investors buying into recent breakouts have seen their share of seesaw action, making it difficult to sit tight, especially given the uncertainty in the general market.


Facebook is currently trading just above a prior 128.43 entry, and may be setting up a new base with an alternative 132.08 buy point.


On Wednesday, the stock rose 1.2% in rising volume to move back into buy range, as the Relative Strength line climbed back into new high ground.


Investors considering a new position in Facebook or any other stock should keep in mind that while it's always important to have sound sell rules, it's especially important when the market is under pressure and the company is getting ready to report earnings.

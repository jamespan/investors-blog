As **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)) approaches the one-year anniversary of its Oct. 12 IPO, the online automotive marketplace provider is one of the [best IPO stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) and is trying to celebrate with a new breakout.




After pricing at 16 for its market debut, CarGurus rose as high as 56.17 by August, a gain of 251%. That gain has helped earn the stock a spot on IBD's [IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/). **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), a fellow member of the Internet-Content industry group, is also on the list of the best IPO stocks to watch.


CarGurus, which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibd-stock-of-the-day-cargurus-stock/), ties Match Group for the No. 4 slot within the group with a 98 Composite Rating. The industry ranks No. 33 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

IPO Stock Expecting 150% EPS Growth
-----------------------------------


The business of connecting buyers and sellers of new and used cars has proved to be a profitable one for CarGurus. Earnings growth has come in at 50% in each of the last two quarters.


Analysts are looking for a 150% rise in earnings per share in the current quarter. That would have earned CarGurus a spot on the list of [stocks expecting 50%-to-2,500% earnings growth in Q3](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-analyst-estimates-eps-growth/), but its 67 EPS Rating fell short of the required 80 or higher score.


Sales growth has ranged from 45% to 96% over the last eight quarters. But note that revenue has been decelerating for several quarters. See if CarGurus can reverse that trend when it reports third-quarter numbers, likely in November.


Signs of institutional demand for the stock include a 1.4 up/down volume ratio, an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A and rising fund ownership. The number of funds with a position in CarGurus jumped from 113 to 189 in Q2.


Management still owns around 33% of shares.


IPO Stocks To Watch
-------------------


CarGurus gapped up just under 18% on Aug. 8, after reporting Q2 earnings. Volume was 375% above average. As many stocks do, it pulled back to fill the bulk of that one-day gap over the next several weeks.


But CarGurus managed to stay above its 50-day line and is now trying to put the finishing touches on a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). On Monday, the stock rose 4.5% to 53.94, lifting it into the 53.41 - 56.08 buy zone. Volume was 91% higher than normal.


Tuesday was a bit of a wild ride, as the stock shot higher, then pulled back below the buy point. CarGurus managed to end the day in positive territory, up 0.7% to 54.71, putting it back in buy range. Preliminary volume was well above average.

Energy drink leader and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) partner **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) is trading in a tight range and may be getting ready to pop with Q3 earnings due Nov. 1.









 
 
 In 2015, Coca-Cola took a 16.7% equity position in Monster and transferred its own energy drink brands to the Corona, Calif.-based company. Since then, demand for energy drinks has continued to grow, while soda consumption has fallen, leading some soft-drink industry watchers to speculate that Coca-Cola may outright acquire Monster.
Rising Earnings, Energized Margins
----------------------------------


Analysts are looking for 21% earnings growth in Q3, which would mark a second straight quarter of acceleration. Monster sports a 37.9% annual pretax profit margin and 18.8% return on equity.


The maker of such drink brands as Monster Rehab and Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology holds the No. 2 rank in the nonalcoholic beverages industry group with an 87 Composite Rating, just behind **Coca-Cola Bottling Consolidated** ([COKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COKE)). **National Beverage** ([FIZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIZZ)) holds the No. 3 slot.


The group itself ranks a lowly No. 136 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Institutional demand for Monster Beverage is reflected in its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 up/down volume ratio and five straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q3 Earnings
----------------------------------


Monster is working on a shallow [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 57.35 entry.



Although the relative strength line needs work, the stock has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks, which could mean it's getting ready to spring higher. Monster has also been finding support right along its 10-day moving average.


Also note that the bottom of the pattern is near an area of long-term resistance around 55. It's a positive sign to see a stock [turn a former ceiling of resistance into a floor of support](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/support-resistance-1/).


See if Monster Beverage can punch through the buy point in volume at least 40% above average, but keep in mind that it can be risky to buy a stock just before it reports.


In early trade Monday, Monster was edging higher, bringing it to within 1% of the buy point. Coke and Coca-Cola Bottling, which are also forming bases, were also both up.

With earnings due Nov. 23, **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) has teamed up with **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) to forge what they call a [first-of-its-kind partnership](https://investors.dicks.com/news/news-details/2021/DICKS-Sporting-Goods-and-NIKE-Create-Connected-Partnership/default.aspx). Dick's Sporting Goods stock is now looking to score a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), while Nike stock challenges a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of its own.

DKS Stock Back Near Buy After Big Gap-Up
----------------------------------------


After reporting fiscal Q2 earnings on Aug. 25, Dick's Sporting Goods stock gapped up to a more than 13% gain, in volume 971% above average. Since then, the Nike partner has pulled back to form its current base â€” a [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 140.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


While forming that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has fallen off the highs it hit on the big [gap-up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) in August. The RS line has begun to trend higher as Dick's Sporting Goods gets ready to report next week.


In another positive sign of returning technical strength, the [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has moved back above the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


Nike stock has shown somewhat similar action as it finds support at the 21-day line after breaking out on Nov. 4 before pulling back. On Friday, Nike rebounded over 2% to poke its head back into the buy zone.

Boosted by a 150% EPS gain last quarter and 87% average annual sales growth over the last three years, 2019 [IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) is digging up a new breakout.




The triple-digit Q4 earnings gain for Datadog is based on comparisons to a prior quarter that showed a loss. But note that it's not unusual for newer IPOs to post impressive revenue gains before a track record of profitability kicks in. Datadog's Q4 sales leapt 84%. Analysts are looking for a 67% EPS increase when the New York-based analytics company reports Q1 numbers on May 11 after the close.


Datadog bills itself as the "monitoring and analytics platform for developers, IT operations teams and business users in the cloud age."


Last month, Datadog received the [AWS Lambda Ready designation](https://investors.datadoghq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/datadog-achieves-aws-lambda-ready-designation) from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). AWS Lambda lets companies run code without acquiring or managing servers. As part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Service Ready Program, the designation shows Datadog's cloud-monitoring platform has demonstrated deep integration with AWS Lambda.


Will Q1 Earnings Give DDOG Stock A Bone — Or A Whack?

On Friday, Datadog stock cleared a 50.22 buy point, pushing it to a new all-time high. All eyes are now are on next week's earnings report. It's always risky to buy a stock just before it reports. Only time will tell if Datadog emerges with its tail wagging or tucked beneath its legs.

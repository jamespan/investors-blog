Enterprise software stock **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) is collaborating on a potential new breakout from a late-stage consolidation. With average annual EPS growth of 51% over the last three years, the Australian company has earned a spot on the [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) screen.




Scoring a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Atlassian is the No. 1-ranked stock in its industry group, which comes in at No. 56 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)), **BlackLine** ([BL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BL)), **SPS Commerce** ([SPSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPSC)) and **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) round out the top five stocks in the industry.


In addition to its strong track record of earnings growth, Atlassian also has generated average annual revenue gains of 39% over the last three years. The provider of cloud-based collaboration software also sports an A SMR Rating, boosted by a 22.9% pretax profit margin and 29.1% annual return on equity.


Top Funds Take Positions In Atlassian Stock
-------------------------------------------


One of the three ["big rocks"](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investing-in-stocks-see-how-to-buy-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) (i.e., the foundations) of [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) is strong institutional sponsorship. Atlassian has that characteristic, with 144 funds with an A+ IBD rating reporting a stake in the stock.


Atlassian stock also sports a solid 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/).


In addition to its own collaboration software, Atlassian has partnered with **Slack Technologies** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)) to develop systems that empower teams to work together more productively and efficiently. Through the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://www.atlassian.com/partnerships/slack), Atlassian offers integrations for Jira Serve for Slack, Confluence Server For Slack, and Bitbucket Server for Slack.


Atlassian and Slack also compete with software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in the collaboration space.


Is Atlassian Stock Ready To Pop?
--------------------------------


After showing tight closes in the weeks ending from Dec. 6 through Jan. 3, Atlassian stock is now on pace to complete a new [three-weeks tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern.


The stock is slightly extended from a 140.59 entry of a cup with handle as it shows that tight trading. The stock jumped more than 10% the week of Jan. 24. During that move, Atlassian stock gapped up after the company reported earnings on Jan. 23. It's healthy to see a stock hold and consolidate its gains after such strong heavy-volume gains.


Atlassian closed Friday's session by completing a three-weeks tight, which could mean the stock is poisted to pop.

Leading retail stocks like **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)), **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) and even **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) have been racking up solid gains recently. Now, teen-focused discount retailer **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) has fashioned a new breakout ahead of earnings after today's market close.




Like fellow discounter Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Five Below has proved to be relatively resistant to the onslaught of e-commerce giant **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Since the second half of last year, [traditional brick-and-mortar retailers](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) like Macy's, Kohl's, Urban Outfitters and Lululemon have also shown they can stand up to Amazon.

Amazon-Resistant Earnings And Sales Growth
------------------------------------------


Based in Philadelphia and founded in 2002, Five Below operates more than 650 stores in 32 states. With a focus on teen fashion for girls, Five Below sells all of its products for $5 or less.


The company breaks down its product lineup in to different "worlds," including Style, Room, Sports, Tech, Create, Party, Candy and Now.


Despite Amazon's continued pressure on retailers, Five Below has continued to deliver solid sales growth, ranging from 18% to 30% over the last eight quarters.


Earnings growth has averaged 59% over the last three reports. With Five Below on tap to report after today's market close, analysts are looking for a 120% spike in earnings-per-share.


Five Below's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) has now improved to a 92, earning it the No. 2 ranking among discount retailers. Ollie's Bargain Outlet holds the top spot with a 96 rating.


After reporting earnings after the close Tuesday, Ollie's Bargain Outlet has now averaged 41% earnings growth over the last three quarters, while revenue gains have come in between 16% and 26% over the last eight reports.

Retail Stocks To Watch
----------------------


Five Below has been working on a later-stage flat base showing a 78.38 buy point. The stock kicked off the week with more than an 8% gain Monday to close at 77.24. Volume was 71% above average.


On Tuesday, Five Below rose 2%, lifting it into the 78.38 to 82.30 buy zone. In afternoon trading Wednesday, the stock is up nearly 3% to 81.17.


Keep in mind that it can be risky to buy a stock just ahead of its next quarterly earnings report. It's generally better to wait and see how the company reports and how the market reacts.



Ollie's Bargain Outlet jumped out of a tight area on Monday in strong volume and added another 1.8% Tuesday ahead of its earnings report. Early Wednesday, the stock fell, but found support at its 10-day moving average. Ollie's has now rebounded into positive territory and is in the upper half of today's price range. Volume is trending over 200% above average.


Monday and Tuesday were [big days for retail stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-amazon-hits-high-williams-sonoma-kohls-shopify-break-out/) like Amazon, Kohl's, Macy's, Urban Outfitters and Lululemon, which are all now out of buy range from their breakouts. In afternoon trading Wednesday, Lululemon, Urban Outfitters and Kohl's are up, while Amazon is down marginally and Macy's is off over 1%.


**Update:** After Wednesday's close, [Five Below reported strong Q1 earnings and guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/five-below-q1-earnings-stock-buy-zone/). The stock was up over 10% after hours. Such action means Five Below may gap up past the regular buy zone Thursday morning. See when [buying on gap ups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) is a sound investing strategy.

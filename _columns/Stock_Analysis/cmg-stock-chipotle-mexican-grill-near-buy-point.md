Starting with an E. coli breakout in 2015,Â **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) went through a few rough years, causing CMG stock to tumble. But the burrito king has come back and is now setting up a potentially fresh new breakout after getting grilled.




Credit for the turnaround goes to [Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/chipotle-stock-heats-up-new-ceo-brian-niccol/). The former head of Taco Bell, which is part of the **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) family, has been modernizing Chipotle, including enhancing its mobile ordering and payment process.


The Newport Beach, Calif.-based company has revived its sales growth to double-digits, with revenue gains ranging from 10% to 15% over the last four quarters.


Earnings for the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose from 39% in Q2 to 77% in the third quarter. Analysts expect the company to report in early February and deliver 55% EPS growth for Q4 and a 57% increase for full-year 2019.

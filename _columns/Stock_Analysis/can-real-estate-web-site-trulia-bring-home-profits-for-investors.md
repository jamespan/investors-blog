It's been a little over a year since **Trulia** ([TRLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRLA)) made its market debut in Sept. 2012. The stock has had a nice run so far and its fundamentals are strengthening as we'll see in a moment.

  

But as a Sept. 25 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/092413-672281-real-estate-website-trulia-sets-stock-high.htm) noted, whether that good fortune continues may depend on whether looming interest rate hikes curb home buying.

  

Trulia's web site provides online tools that help buyers find prospective homes. It also sells subscriptions to real estate agents to help them offer their services directly to buyers and sellers.

  

The housing industry has been rebounding. But there are concerns that rising interest rates could slow growth in the industry.

  

The National Association of Realtors recently warned housing sales may be uneven in coming months. But many industry analysts remain upbeat about the state of the housing market.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Trulia turned profitable in the second quarter with a 5-cent-a-share gain. And it's scored a long string of sales growth gains

  

• For the full year, analysts expect earnings of 22 cents a share compared to a 37-cent-a-share loss last year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-trulia-inc-trla.aspx) shows Trulia carries an 87 Composite Rating, which is ranked No. 17 among the 41 stocks in its Internet-Content industry group.

  

The group as a whole has been one of the market's better performers and ranks No. 11 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Trulia came public last year and has scored some good gains, but fell below the 50-day moving average line last week on heavy volume as the market turned rocky.

  

Watch to see if it can recover and climb back above that benchmark line or if goes on to form a base pattern.

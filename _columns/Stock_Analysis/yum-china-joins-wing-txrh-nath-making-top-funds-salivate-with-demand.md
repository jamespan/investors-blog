Biting Back At Covid With 333% EPS Growth
-----------------------------------------


From a single restaurant in 1987, Yum China now operates nearly 13,000 restaurants in over 1,800 cities and towns. Its restaurants span every province and autonomous region across mainland China.


The company has the exclusive right to operate and sub-license the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China. The restaurateur partners with Lavazza to explore and develop the Lavazza coffee shop concept in China and owns the Little Sheep and Huang Ji Huang concepts outright.


After Covid slammed China, Yum China managed to post impressive earnings growth in the second half of last year. After a 123% EPS spike to 49 cents a share in Q3, Yum China spiced up a year-over-year 333% jump in [Q4](https://ir.yumchina.com/news-releases/news-release-details/yum-china-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results), leading to a [$628 million profit for 2022](https://ir.yumchina.com/news-releases/news-release-details/yum-china-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results).


For this year, analysts forecast 92% EPS growth in Q1 and an 84% gain for the year.


Sales growth has been more challenging. Revenue went from a 1% gain to $2.3 billion in Q4 2021 to a 9% year-over-year slowdown to $2.1 billion in Q4 2022.


While reporting its 2022 performance on Feb. 7, Yum China said its overall business environment and consumer sentiment have improved. It remains cautiously optimistic while near-term uncertainties remain.


Restaurant Stocks Taste-Test Breakout Buffet
--------------------------------------------


While restaurant stocks are showing some tempting chart action, the [banking crisis](https://www.investors.com/tag/banking-crisis/) and current market correction leave an uncertain aftertaste.


Yum China continues to cook up a potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-using-flat-base-chart-pattern/) from an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) showing a 63.16 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has already hit a new high. On Friday, the stock jumped to just below the buy point but then pulled back. It came off its lows to close the week above the 50-day moving average.


Wingstop has flashed volatility since jumping to a new high last month, but has found support at its 10-week moving average. It gained nearly 4% Thursday and rose again Friday. WING stock is now extended from its [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/). Texas Roadhouse is also nibbling at a the very top of its buy zone, while Nathan's Famous tried but failed to close above its 50-day line.


CMG stock has held support at its 10-week line as it prepares to serve up a breakout in an early stage flat base.

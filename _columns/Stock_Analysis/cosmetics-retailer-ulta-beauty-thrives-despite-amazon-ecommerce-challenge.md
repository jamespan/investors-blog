While retailers across a wide range of industries are struggling to compete with **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) has remained virtually blemish free. Now the question is, can Ulta's stock keep its glowing complexion in the face of the current market downtrend?


In 2013, [Amazon launched a luxury beauty portal](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/122815-786875-beauty-ulta-sephora-immune-to-amazon-effect.htm) that some feared would do to cosmetics stores what CEO Jeff Bezos' behemoth did to booksellers. But along with fellow beauty supplies retailer Sephora, Ulta has continued to thrive by offering something Amazon can't: a satisfying in-store experience and an opportunity to put on the makeup before you pull out a credit card.


The woman behind Ulta's success is CEO Mary Dillon, who took the reins in 2013 and joined the board of **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) earlier this month. In addition to learning from her success at Ulta, the coffee giant can tap into Dillon's previous experience with consumer-driven brands at **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)), as well as her stint on the board of **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)).


**Key Numbers**


Ulta has delivered the type of consistent growth fund managers like to see. Sales growth has ranged from 19% to 22% over the last seven quarters and earnings gains have come in between 18% to 35% during the same period.


That's one reason the number of funds with a position in the stock has been rising in recent quarters, and why Ulta made the IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/010816-788909-new-stock-buys-of-top-performing-mutual-funds.htm). Over the last quarter, 35 funds invested a total of $64 million in the stock.


Overall, Ulta Beauty earns a 98 Composite Rating, earning it the No. 1 ranking among its peers in the specialty retailers industry group.


**Chart Analysis**


During a market downturn, look for stocks showing resilience by checking the Relative Strength line.


Ulta Beauty's RS line has remained near new high ground, meaning it's outperforming the rest of the market. Tight weekly closes and support at the 10-week line are also signs that Ulta has been holding its ground.


The stock cleared a 175.88 buy point on Dec. 4, the day after reporting earnings. It gapped up to close nearly 13% higher for the day on volume 503% above average.


The tight trading that followed points to conviction among fund managers, especially given the sharp decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


While Ulta technically remains just within a 175.88 â€” 184.67 buy zone, it's risky to make new purchases during a correction. But continue to track the stock as we wait for a new uptrend to begin.

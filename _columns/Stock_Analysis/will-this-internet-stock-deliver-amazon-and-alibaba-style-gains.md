 Following the lead of fellow internet stocks **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) has posted a new breakout and is still within the buy zone.
Like birds of a feather, stocks tend to flock together, and internet-related stocks have been on the rise recently. The internet retail industry group now ranks No. 5 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, with Alibaba (No. 1), JD.com (No. 2) and Amazon (No. 5) each earning a spot among the top 5 group leaders. Stamps.com holds the No. 4 position.


While microblogging platform **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) is technically listed in the internet content industry group, it's also been riding the wave of institutional demand for internet stocks.


Posting Profits
---------------


Top- and bottom-line growth has slowed recently, with Q1 EPS gains falling from 74% to a still impressive 62%. Revenue gains dropped from 52% to 28%.


But Stamps.com's average gains over the last three years remain impressive for both earnings (80%) and sales (50%).


The company also sports a 48% return on equity and 46% annual pretax profit margin.


The Postman Just Rang Twice
---------------------------


Stamps.com has now cleared a cup-shaped pattern as the second part of a base-on-base pattern.


It began forming the consolidation in February after clearing a 114.70 buy point and rising nearly 19%.



The stock sold off in heavy volume to form the left side of the new base, but bounced back in even stronger trade over the last several weeks as the relative strength line climbed sharply higher.


Stamps.com recaptured its 50-day line earlier this month, and the [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/) is also back above that key benchmark — a sign of renewed technical strength.


The stock rose nearly 5% Wednesday in volume 96% above average, ending the day 3% below the potential 136.10 entry. On Thursday, Stamps.com jumped over 4% to clear the buy point in heavy trade.


As many stocks do after a breakout, Stamps.com retreated to its buy point Friday, but it found support and returned to positive territory, ending 17% higher for the week.


Stamps.com heads into Memorial Day weekend at the upper end of the buy range, which extends up to 142.91.

**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) aren't the only large banks top-performing mutual fund managers have been buying recently. They've also set their sights on IBD 50 member **Citizens Financial Group** ([CFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFG)).
As IBD's latest list of [new buys by top funds over the last three months](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-buy-big-banks-morgan-stanley-bank-of-america/) shows, 33 leading institutional investors scooped up an estimated $852 million worth of BofA shares, while 37 invested $421 in Morgan Stanley.


Twenty-seven of top funds put approximately $134 million into Citizens Financial during the same time period.


Eight quarters of rising fund ownership and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating further confirm demand for the stock.


Regional Bank With Deep Roots
-----------------------------


As a member of the Banks-Northeast industry group, Citizens Financial has over 1,200 branches in 11 states, with over $112 billion in deposits and more than $150 billion in total assets.


The Providence, R.I.-based company traces its roots back to 1828, making it one of the oldest financial institutions in the country.


The Royal Bank of Scotland bought the regional bank in 1988, but was required by British regulators to sell the company to raise capital, leading to Citizen Financial's IPO in 2014.


Citizens Financial reported a 49% EPS gain in Q1, marking a fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth.


Revenue gains have ranged from 11% to 14% over the last three reports.


Analysts expect EPS to grow 27% this year, followed by a 13% gain in 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Will Trump Bump Continue?
-------------------------


Following its September 2014 market debut, Citizen Financial peaked at just under 29 in June 2015, and stayed below that mark until last November, when it bolted higher along with other financial stocks on Donald Trump's surprise win.


The stock continued to climb higher until pulling back in March to start forming its current base, a first-stage cup.


Citizens Financial has been edging closer to a potential 39.85 entry, while reclaiming its 50-day line and finding support at its 10-day moving average.


Also note how the shorter-term 10-day line has climbed back above its longer-term cousin — a sign of renewed technical strength.


The stock was down fractionally Tuesday to 37.18 in light volume. See if the stock goes on to form a handle, which takes a minimum of five days (starting with the first down day) to form. The buy point in that scenario would be 38.11.


Whatever the entry ends up being, see if fund managers continue to pick up shares and launch Citizens Financial into a new buy zone in heavy volume.

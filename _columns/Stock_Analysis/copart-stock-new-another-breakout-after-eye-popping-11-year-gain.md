Take a look at the monthly chart for vehicle auction specialist **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), and you'll see CPRT stock has soared by a whopping 11,036% from March 2003 through the end of 2023.




Today, Copart stands poised to extend that run with another [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) as 2024 gets underway. The stock reversed lower for the week, but is just 4% shy of a new buy point. It is now below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Due to an extended slump that began in late 2021, Copart fell off the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list, which features **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) and eight others. But Copart maintains a strong [Earnings Stability Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/earnings-growth-is-essential-but-better-when-its-also-steady-heres-how-to-find-it/) from Investor's Business Daily — a key component of these long-term leaders.


Unlike the higher-is-better [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), the lower a company's Earnings Stability Rating, the more stable the earnings. Copart's score of 6 ties that of Microsoft. Cadence sports an even stronger rating of 3.


Speaking of its Composite Rating, [Copart stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-copart-cprt.aspx) earns a score of 91 out of a best-possible 99. That puts it in the top 9% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). [Cadence](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-cadence-design-systems-cdns.aspx) has a score of 98 while [Microsoft](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-copart-cprt.aspx) gets a 97.


Copart Brings AI To Auctions
----------------------------


Founded in 1982 with a single salvage yard in California, Copart has evolved into a global leader. Now the premier source for online vehicle auctions, the Dallas-based firm currently operates more than 200 locations in 11 countries. It has more than 175,000 vehicles up for auction every day.


Copart specializes in the resale and remarketing of used, wholesale and salvage title vehicles. It works with a variety of sellers, including insurance companies, rental car companies, local municipalities, financial institutions and charities.


In September, Copart announced a strategic partnership to support auto insurers — with an [artificial intelligence twist](https://www.copart.com/content/us/en/press-releases/announcement-of-copart-partnership-with-hi-marley).


The collaboration is with Hi Marley — the first intelligent conversational platform built for property and casualty insurance and powered by SMS, the text messaging service. Designed by insurance professionals, the Hi Marley texting platform enables what the firms call "lovable, convenient conversations" across the entire ecosystem to build customer loyalty.


Showcasing yet another way artificial intelligence is seeping into all industries, Copart aims to streamline the total loss triage process by using AI to drive faster and more accurate total loss decision.


Copart Stock Near Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------------------------


While Microsoft reports earnings on Jan. 30, Copart is scheduled to release its performance numbers on Feb. 21 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024.


In its prior report for fiscal Q1 on Nov. 16, Copart posted earnings of 34 cents per share, marking a 31% spike over the prior year's quarter. Sales accelerated for a second straight quarter to $1.02 billion.


While Copart stock did not join Microsoft on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/msft-stock-leads-new-buys-by-best-mutual-funds-this-sector-sees-strong-demand/), 55 funds with an A+ rating from IBD that own shares in the company.


On Nov. 10, Copart shot past a 47.38 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase), several days ahead of its last earnings report. After quickly rising nearly 9%, it pulled back to form its current base, an early-stage [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#doublebottom). Copart stock now trades about 4% shy of a new 50.22 buy point.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) slumped as the new base formed. Look for the RS line to perk up as Copart stock holds support at its 50-day line.


As fellow Earnings Stability Rating leader Microsoft hits yet another record high, see if Copart can build on its own massive 11-year gain with another breakout move.

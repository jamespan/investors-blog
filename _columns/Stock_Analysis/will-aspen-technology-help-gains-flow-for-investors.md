Refining oil, natural gas and other fuels can be a tricky process because it involves dozens of steps and variables. And if you don't do it the right way, it can lead to disaster.

  

To make the process easier and reduce the risk of errors, refineries depend on software programs that let them do everything simulating the refining process to designing the facility itself.

  

That's the kind of software **Aspen Technology** ([AZPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZPN)) makes. The firm was featured in the Nov. 22 [New America column](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/112113-680133-aspen-technology-streamlines-work-in-oil-industry-and-factories.htm?ntt=azpn). Aspen makes business management software for oil, gas, energy and chemical companies.

  

Its Aspen One suite is used in engineering, manufacturing and supply chain processes. The software lets clients model and design facilities, as well as monitor and optimize performance.

  

For instance, refineries can use the technology to determine what kinds of fuels they should produce to take advantage of price trends.

  

And lately Aspen has seen a big turnaround in its financial fortunes, thanks to efforts to streamline its business.

  

In 2008, the firm shifted from an upfront license model to a subscription model. That helped smooth out its revenue stream and gave it more visibility.

  

With that restructuring out of the way, Aspen can now focus on researching and developing new products.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•You can see that turnaround in Aspens' fundamentals. Earnings were up 138% last quarter. 

  

• Sales growth ranged from 23% to 30% the past three quarters. 

  

• Moving forward, analysts see earnings rising 24% in the current fiscal year, which ends in June, and 26% the following year. Stock Checkup [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-aspen-technology-inc-azpn.aspx) shows Aspen's 96 Composite Rating is the fourth highest in the Computer Software-Enterprise industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 19 among IBD's 197 groups, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Aspen broke out of a flat base in late Oct., blasting past the 36.64 ideal buy point.

  

And since then, it's held on to most of those gains, trading in a fairly narrow price range.

  

It then formed a three-weeks-tight pattern. That formation occurs when a stock's weekly price closes are within about 1% of each other for three weeks or more.

  

To find the potential buy point, just add 10 cents to the peak in the pattern. That makes the ideal buy point 39.12

  

Watch to see if Aspen can break out past the buy point on heavy volume and launch a new climb.

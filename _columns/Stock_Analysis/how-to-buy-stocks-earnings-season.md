With top stocks to watch like **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) getting ready to report earnings, it's time to [build your earnings season watch list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2360792) and follow sound rules for how to buy stocks set to release their latest numbers.




In addition to currently working on bases that could launch a new breakout, Salesforce, Abiomed, ServiceNow and LGI Homes also all made IBD's list of [stocks expecting 50%-plus earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/q1-earnings-stocks-to-watch-netflix-salesforce-floor-and-decor-pagseguro/) in their next report.


The consensus analyst estimate for Salesforce's Q1 earnings, expected on May 16, recently rose from 61% to 67%. The pioneer in software as a service (SaaP) is on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) as it works on a flat base with a 128.97 buy point. Salesforce closed the week 5% below the entry.



Enterprise software developer ServiceNow is trying to clear a 176.66 buy point in a second-stage flat base ahead of its April 25 earnings report. Consensus analyst estimates call for a 54% rise in earnings growth. ServiceNow is also around 4% below its potential breakout price. The stock may be forming a handle, which would give it an earlier entry at 175.64. ServiceNow was down over 2% Friday, but in below-average volume.


Abiomed is testing a 304.38 entry, but it's a later-stage pattern, which entails more risk. The Massachusetts-based company, which develops medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the heart, is expected to post a 60% EPS increase when it reports on May 3. Abiomed is 1% above the buy point.


LGI Homes has been testing a 72.10 buy point in a late-stage cup with handle as it gets ready to report Q1 earnings around May 9. Analysts are looking for 50% EPS growth from the entry-level homebuilder.


But stocks can be particularly volatile during earnings season, so it's important to follow some basic rules on how to buy stocks as they get ready to report their latest quarterly numbers.


How To Buy Stocks During Earnings Season
----------------------------------------


While you can't take all of the guesswork out of investing, you can manage and mitigate your risk by following some basic rules.


* **Wait for the stock to break out in heavy volume.** Avoid the temptation to jump in early. Let the stock prove itself with a solid breakout. Such patience significantly reduces your risk and still leaves you plenty of potential upside.
* **Avoid buying a stock just before it reports earnings.** As every investor knows, an earnings report — a seemingly "good" or "bad" one — can send a stock sharply higher or lower. If you buy just a few days before the company reports, you likely won't have enough of a profit cushion to protect you from a sudden, post-earnings drop.
* **Focus on stocks that pass your buying checklist.** While no stock is perfect, the more passing grades a stock has for the [key stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/), the more likely it is to have a sustained climb. If the stock you're watching has many failing scores, it's probably a sign to keep your powder dry for the time being.


You can also further reduce your risk by following an [options strategy during earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/), and by regularly checking IBD's [Earnings Preview column and earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).

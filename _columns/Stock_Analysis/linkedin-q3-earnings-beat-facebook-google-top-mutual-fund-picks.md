When **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) reported Q3 numbers on Oct. 29, it didn't just smash analyst estimates for earnings, it also revealed it may be tapping into an even better-than-expected catalyst for future growth: Lynda.com.

  

In April, LinkedIn paid $1.5 billion for the video training website as a way to generate additional revenue from the social networking leader's 400 million members.

  

As the [Motley Fool noted](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/05/is-linkedin-corporation-building-a-new-platform.aspx), LinkedIn CEO Jeffrey Weiner said one growth scenario is to "think about Lynda more as a platform" for businesses "to improve the way their employees are learning and developing."

  

Large investors have taken a renewed interest in LinkedIn recently, helping it make IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/110315-778953-internet-stocks-favored-by-top-performing-mutual-funds.htm). **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) also made the list.

  

Demand for LinkedIn and its peers has lifted the Internet content group to the No. 2 slot among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

That wasn't the case back on May 1, when the stock crashed below the 10- and 40-week moving average lines following Q1 earnings.

  

But since establishing a new low in August, which reset the base count, the stock has been on the rebound.

  

It's now working on a first-stage base with a 276.28 entry.

  

The pattern could also be seen as a double bottom with an earlier 233.28 buy point.

  

The stock recaptured the 40-week line in heavy volume Oct. 30, and the Relative Strength line is near new high ground.

  

But LinkedIn formed most of its base below the 40-week line, and the 10-week moving average is still below the 40-week benchmark.

  

That type of lingering technical weakness could mean the stock isn't quite ready to run. It may need to form an additional flat base or other pattern before climbing more.

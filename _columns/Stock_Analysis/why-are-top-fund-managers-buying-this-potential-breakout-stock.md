 When looking for stocks to watch, focus on what the best fund managers have been buying recently. **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)) is one company that fits that bill.
The New York-based firm, which enables electronic trading of bonds and other fixed-income instruments, made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-new-stock-buys-chips-pizza-movies/), along with **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and several others, including the No. 1 and No. 2 IBD 50 stocks, **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) and **NutriSystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)).


No. 1 Stock In Industry
-----------------------


MarketAxess's track record of profitability is one factor driving demand for its shares.


Boosted by a 51.8% annual pretax profit margin and a 29.4% return on equity, the company has posted average EPS growth of 38% over the last three quarters.


Sales have grown at an average clip of 17% during the same period.


The company, which has operations in North America, Europe and Asia, reported Q1 numbers on April 26, showing a rise in earnings growth from 35% to 44%.


For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 21%, followed by a 24% gain in 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


A 97 Composite Rating earns MarketAxess top billing within the Finance-Investment Banks/Brokers industry group, ahead of **Houlihan Lokey** ([HLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLI)), **Moelis** ([MC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MC)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **E\*Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)).


Will Later-Stage Base Work?
---------------------------


Since breaking out of a long cup-with-handle in October 2014, MarketAxess has made an impressive run.


The question now is, can it continue?


It's currently working on a third-stage base-on-base formation, made up of a prior double bottom and the current cup, which appears to be adding a handle which would offer a 197.84 entry.


Volume within a handle should lighten up to show that selling on the pullback is not aggressive. That has been the case with MarketAxess.


Trading on recent down days has been well below two heavy-volume up days on Apr. 26 and 27 after the company reported Q1 earnings.


On Tuesday, the stock was down over 1%, but volume light and MarkeAxess stayed above its 50-day line.


Also note how the 10-day moving average is trying to climb back above its 50-day cousin. If it does, that would be a sign of renewed technical strength.



While later-stage patterns add more risk, MarketAxess has a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and has shown signs of institutional buying within the base.


Keep an eye on the relative strength line and see if it can get closer to new high ground.


If the stock does break out, make sure volume is at least 40% above average to show conviction for the move.

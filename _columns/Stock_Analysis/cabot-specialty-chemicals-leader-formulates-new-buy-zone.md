Cabot Expands Next-Gen Digital Printing To Meet Demand
------------------------------------------------------


As part of its lineup, Cabot makes pigment dispersions for digital printing. Last month, the company announced will [increase capacity](https://investor.cabot-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cabot-corporation-expand-inkjet-facility-haverhill-mass) at Haverhill, Mass., facility to meet growing demand for digital printing applications in the inkjet market.


Compared to analog printing, its next generation digital printing delivers greater design customization and can improve speed to market. It also enables sustainability advantages through shorter production runs and less waste.


The company has also announced that, effective June 1 (or as contracts allow), [Cabot will raise prices up to 15% globally](https://investor.cabot-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cabot-corporation-increase-prices-globally-all-cab-o-siltm). The move comes in response to increased costs of treating agents and transportation as well as higher plant operating costs.


Over the last five quarters, sales growth has ranged from 19% to 77%. In its latest report on May 2, Cabot's earnings growth jumped from 9% in Q4 2021 to 22% in Q1.


Although Cabot did not join fellow chemicals stock **Ashland** ([ASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASH)) on the list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-aapl-brkb-pm-stock-in-market-correction-as-new-uptrend-awaits/), 34 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported a position in CBT stock.


Cabot pays a [dividend](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/) currently yielding 2.0% on an annualized basis.

Boosted by an expanded partnership with **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and a newly completed [acquisition of AWR](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/company/newsroom/press-releases/pr/2020/cadence-completes-acquisition-of-awr-corporation-from-national-i.html) from National Instruments, **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) has mapped out a potential new buy point.




The purchase of AWR will expand Cadence's reach into 5G communications systems for the aerospace and defense, [automotive](https://www.investors.com/news/automotive-industry-news-self-driving-cars-and-stocks-to-watch/) and wireless markets.


Earlier this month, Cadence Design Systems also said it has expanded its collaboration with Broadcom for the creation of [semiconductor products](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) for next-generation networking, broadband, enterprise storage, wireless and industrial applications.


After more than a 2% gain on Thursday, Broadcom stock added to its gain again on Friday. It's now again testing its 323.30 entry.


Through its Intelligent System Design strategy, the Silicon Valley-based Cadence Design Systems develops products in a wide range of industries. In addition to aerospace, defense and automotive, Cadence is also an innovator in [5G](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/), machine learning, [cloud data centers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), Internet of Things, mobile and photonics.


Cadence Among Top 5G, IoT Stocks To Watch
-----------------------------------------


In a sign of strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), 106 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-big-in-microsoft-alibaba-facebook-defense-stocks/) with an A+ IBD rating own shares of Cadence. It also sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-helps/), 2.0 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/) and seven quarters of rising fund ownership.


Professional money managers like how Cadence Design Systems carries a 29.3% annual pretax profit margin and 46.2% return on equity. Those metrics show that Cadence is an efficiently run company.


Analysts expect Cadence to report Q4 and full-year 2019 earnings Feb. 12 after the close. Market watchers are looking for earnings growth of 17% for 2019 and a 7% gain in 2020. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Cadence Stock May Be The Next IoT, 5G Breakout
----------------------------------------------


Cadence Design Systems is working on a saucer-shaped base. It came close to [resetting its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) in October, but didn't quite undercut the low in its prior pattern.


The current [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 77.18. The stock has now closed higher for its seventh straight week, but its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is still shy of new-high ground. If Cadence stock does breakout, it will mark a new all-time high.


Earlier in December, it formed a [three-weeks tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) and has cleared that in below-average but rising volume. Such behavior is a positive sign to see within a base as a stock sets up a potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Cadence closed the week with a 1.2% gain, leaving it 3% below the buy point.

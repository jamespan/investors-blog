[Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and even a rebounding **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) continue to make good on their nickname as they trade at or near all-time highs. With Nvidia building on its post-earnings surge, [Microsoft stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) is now showing resilience as it teases a breakout and record high of its own.




Interestingly, none of the Magnificent Seven made this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-broadcom-dethrones-nvidia/), including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [Apple](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/), [Amazon](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/is-amazon-stock-buy-now-amzn/) and [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/). But the artificial intelligence boom and demand for these titans of tech continues, as evidenced by their stock performance.


After [Nvidia smashed targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q1-2025-earnings/) after the close Wednesday, the AI powerhouse soared past the 1,000 mark with its relative strength line hitting a 52-week high. It closed with more than a 9% gain on Thursday, rising again Friday to score more than a 14% gain for the week. Microsoft stock dipped below a new buy zone Thursday but reversed higher on Friday to close right around that entry.


Microsoft And ServiceNow Double Up On AI Assistants
---------------------------------------------------


Earlier this month, Microsoft and leading enterprise software firm **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) expanded their strategic alliance. The goal is to leverage their combined generative-AI capabilities.


The [Microsoft-ServiceNow collaboration](https://news.microsoft.com/2024/05/08/servicenow-and-microsoft-expand-strategic-alliance-combining-generative-ai-capabilities-to-enhance-choice-and-flexibility/) aims to integrate both firms' generative AI assistants into one seamless experience. The companies say that melding ServiceNow's Now Assist platform with Microsoft Copilot will make it easier to create value for enterprise workers. The partnership also looks to help employees unlock new avenues to improve productivity.


The combined tools within Microsoft 365 aims to help quickly eliminate friction for employees. Specifically, Copilot will be able to hand off employee requests to Now Assist in Microsoft Teams. Now Assist will provide employees with responses to questions as well as recommend actions and next steps in a conversational manner.


Microsoft Stock Teases New Breakout
-----------------------------------


After teasing a breakout on Wednesday, Microsoft slipped below its 430.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) on Thursday as the Nasdaq sold off.  But both the Nasdaq and Microsoft bounced back on Friday.  Shares of MSFT rose just under 1% to close just shy the buy point at 430.16.


While trending generally sideways this year, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for Microsoft stock perked up while forming the right side of its base. A solid breakout would establish a new all-time high for Microsoft, which went public in 1986.


Meanwhile, Amazon is trying to hold support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Apple stock continues to work on a base with a 196.38 buy point but also encountered selling pressure on Thursday. It rose nearly 2% Friday. Like Microsoft, Google stock ended Wednesday's trading within striking distance of a record high but pulled back as the Nasdaq retreated from Thursday's highs. As the tech-heavy index rose Friday, Alphabet also showed resilience.


Boosted by its rosy quarterly report, Nvidia soared out of buy range from a 922.20 entry in a cup with handle. It has also now climbed beyond buy range from an alternative entry at 974. Nvidia closed by notching a new all-time high.

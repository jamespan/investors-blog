The rise of electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing services is creating a brave new world for automakers like **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), as well as tech titans **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


Even **Wal-Mart Stores** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) is [launching a ride-sharing service](https://www.investors.com/news/wal-mart-to-launch-uber-lyft-delivery-as-it-competes-with-amazon/), partnering with Uber and Lyft to help it compete with **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in the home delivery services arena.


But the digital age is also transforming the car buying process, and **CDK Global** ([CDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDK)) is a leading provider of information technology and digital marketing solutions that help dealers navigate the changing landscape.


In a recent survey, CDK found that nearly [90% of car shoppers](http://cdkglobal.com/company/media-center/survey-reveals-nearly-ninety-percent-car-shoppers-prefer-dealership-where-they) prefer to start the buying process online, with nearly 60% saying they prefer to take those steps on the dealer's own site, rather than use a third-party service.


The Illinois-based company, which had its IPO in 2014, recently launched CDK Connected Store, an online car buying solution for dealers that allows shoppers to select a down payment, determine trade-in value and get credit information before they step onto the lot.


CDK has posted rising earnings growth for three straight quarters, with Q1 showing an EPS gain of 27%.Â  The company has over $2 billion in annual revenue, but sales grew just 2% last quarter.


Will Institutional Demand Drive CDK Higher?
-------------------------------------------


CDK Global broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) just four weeks after going public, rising over 80% in seven months.


Since last June, it's been working on a first-stage cup, showing healthy trading in the right side of the pattern, closing higher for nine of the last 10 weeks.


During that time, the 10-week line has climbed back above the 40-week moving average, and the Relative Strength line has moved into new high ground ahead of a possible breakout.


The stock's 2.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio, A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and rising fund ownership in recent quarters confirm institutional demand for shares.


Look for CDK Global to clear the 57.99 entry in volume at least 40% above average.

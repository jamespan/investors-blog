Genetic analysis equipment maker **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) is finding support at its 10-week moving average 1 after clearing a cup-with-handle base 2.

  

The buy point from that base was at 71.16, a dime above the peak in the handle.

  

Illumina broke out during the week ended April 29 3, when the overall market was still in a confirmed uptrend.

  

The stock managed to head higher over the next couple of weeks, but as the general market fell into a correction, Illumina also got pulled down.

  

So far, it seems to be finding support at its 10-week line, which as you can see, is right around the buy point for the cup with handle. That'll be a testing point for the stock. Will it hold the line at that former area of resistance and move higher?

  

One encouraging sign is that the pullback has occurred in light trading 4. Comparing recent down weeks vs. up weeks, you'd generally find more volume on the gains.

  

Tight price action in many parts of the base also are constructive signs. The up/down volume ratio is quite bullish 5.

When looking for stocks to buy and watch, start with a look at the top-rated companies in the top-ranked industry groups. Real estate-focused software provider **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)) fits that bill as it enters a new buy zone.




Boosted by a [string of acquisitions](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/47106-realpage-acquisition-spree-continues-agrees-to-purchase-rentlytics) over the last two years, RealPage has posted revenue gains ranging from 13% to 34% over the last eight quarters. Sales have exceeded $200 million in each of the last four reports, including a 21% gain to $227 million in Q4.


The Texas-based company continues to be efficiently run, as indicated by a 19% annual pretax profit margin and a 17% return on equity.

RealPage Among Top Stocks In Top Industry Group
-----------------------------------------------


With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, RealPage shares the No. 1 spot among specialty enterprise software stocks with **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), **Micro Focus International** ([MFGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFGP)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). The industry group itself ranks No. 10 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


RealPage and Atlassian have both earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), while Atlassian is also on [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders). Both screens have a track record of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


Micro Focus International tops the latest list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/fastest-growing-companies-best-stocks-to-buy-watch/), with average annual EPS growth of 922% over the last three years.


RealPage Stock In Buy Zone After Resetting Base Count
-----------------------------------------------------


After climbing as much as 202% from an April 2016 breakout, RealPage pulled back sharply as a bear market took hold in Q4 of last year. The stock ended up declining as much as 35% while forming its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


The silver lining of that drop was how RealPage undercut the low in its prior consolidation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making the current formation a first-stage pattern.


Since establishing the bottom of that base, the stock has closed higher for nine consecutive weeks and is on pace to make it 10 in a row. Its relative strength line has been rising during that run and is now just below a new 52-week high. See if the 10-week moving average can move back above the longer-term 40-week line to further indicate a technical rebound.


In the lead-up to the company's Q4 earnings report on Feb. 25, the stock was testing a 59.10 buy point. After reporting a 50% EPS gain, the stock initially fell sharply below the entry on Feb. 26, but it posted a bullish reversal to end the day in buy range and at the top of the price range. Volume was 218% above average.


RealPage ended Friday's session with a 2.5% gain for the week to close at 61.39, still within the buy zone, which extends to 62.06.

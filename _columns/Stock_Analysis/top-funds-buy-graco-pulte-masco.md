With top-performing mutual funds picking up shares in building and industrial machinery stocks like **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)), **Parker-Hannifin** ([PH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PH)) and **Illinois Tool Works** ([ITW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITW)), it's not surprising that these leading portfolio managers also bought shares in **Graco** ([GGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GGG)), a global leader in spray-painting and coating systems that operates across a wide range of sectors.


 IBD's latest list of [new buys by top funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/stocks-to-watch-top-funds-buy-apple-intel-bofa/) shows that 36 mutual funds bought a total of about $56 million worth of Graco shares.


Forty funds invested $79 million into [leading homebuilder stock](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) Pulte, while 54 funds scooped up $119 million worth of Masco shares.


Parker-Hannifin got an investment of $138 million from 46 funds, and 48 picked up $174 million worth of Illinois Tool Works shares.


3-For-1 Stock Split Coming Soon
-------------------------------


Based in Minneapolis, Graco provides equipment to "move, measure, control, dispense and spray fluid and powder materials" in the manufacturing processing and construction industries.


Graco's 95 Composite Rating, 33% return on equity and average EPS growth of 47% over the last three quarters earn it the No. 3 spot within the Machinery-General Industrial group, just behind **Gardner Denver** ([GDI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDI)), a maker of industrial compressors that is one of the [best IPO stocks of 2017](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), and **Intricon** ([IIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIN)), which manufactures micro-miniature components and plastic parts used in medical, hearing and electronics equipment.


In Q3, Graco saw revenue growth increase from 9% to 16%.


Last week, Graco announced a 3-for-1 stock split, with shares to be distributed on Dec. 27 for shareholders of record as of Dec. 18. This marks the twelfth split since the company went public in 1969.


While [large stock splits can sometimes mark the end of a big run](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-great-stocks-why-big-stock-splits-usually-warn-the-end-is-near/), that's not always the case. So keep a close eye on Graco's share price and chart action as it heads into the new year.


The stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.2 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership indicate solid institutional demand for shares.


Steppingstones For Continued Climb?
-----------------------------------


After hitting long-term resistance around 80 from November 2013 to late last year, Graco finally punched through that ceiling to launch a solid run that has so far seen the share price rise around 57% from a breakout in January.



The stock is now working on a shallow flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. As it has for the entire run, Graco continues to find support along its 10-week moving average. Such behavior may mean the stock is laying a new steppingstone or launchpad for a continued climb.


On Tuesday, Graco fell over 1% to 129.35, leaving it still above the 50-day line and about 4% below the 134.21 buy point. As you like to see on a decline, volume was below average and lower than on prior up days.


See if the relative strength line can move into new high ground and if Graco can clear the entry in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

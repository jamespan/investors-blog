With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating in a highly ranked industry group, clinical research firm **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) is among the top stocks to watch. Plus, it's trading just below a potential new buy point. But will the general market provide a tailwind or a headwind?




Medpace is one of five contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical research companies on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). The other top growth stocks include **Charles River Lab**s ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), **Syneos Health** ([SYNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNH)) and **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)).


Each stock has a 99 Composite Rating, and the group ranks No. 15 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


PRA was recently featured in [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/stocks-to-watch-clinical-research-organization-pra-health-sciences/) as it broke out from an early-stage consolidation.


Medpace has also earned a spot on the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) screens.

Clinical Research Leader Solidly Among Stocks To Watch
------------------------------------------------------


As a clinical research provider, Medpace provides phase one to four clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical devices industries. It operates a wide range of disciplines, including oncology, cardiology, metabolic disease and the central nervous system.


Based in Cincinnati, Medpace has some 2,800 employees across 36 countries.


Medpace has delivered impressive top- and bottom-line growth over the last three quarters. Earnings gains have ranged from 61% to 68%, while revenue growth has come in between 53% and 62%.


Analyst earnings estimates for all of 2018 (66%) and 2019 (15%) have recently been revised higher.


The stock's B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.9 up/down volume ratio and five quarters of rising fund ownership all point to solid institutional demand for Medpace.


The company was founded in 1992 and had its IPO in 2016.


Buy Point On Trial
------------------


Medpace pulled back as the general market showed increased volatility over the last two months. But the stock has managed to show resilience and bounce back to [retake its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


The stock has been rising sharply since the market outlook returned to "[confirmed uptrend.](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)" In another sign of market leadership, Medpace's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has hit a new 52-week high.


Shares rose more than 13% last week, and the stock added 3.3% on Monday in volume 35% above average.


But as the stock market pulled back Tuesday, Medpace fell 4% to 61.40 in above-average volume, leaving it 6% shy of the 65.19 buy point.

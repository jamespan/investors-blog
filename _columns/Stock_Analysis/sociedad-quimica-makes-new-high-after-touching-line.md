Sometimes a stock offers multiple buy points, and **Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)) is one of those cases.

  

The stock formed a cup-with-handle base, then broke out past its 60.27 buy point on April 29 1.

  

But volume was only 28% above average, which wasn't impressive for a breakout.

  

The stock didn't make it far and instead pulled back to its 10-week moving average line. In doing so it formed a high handle and created a buy point at 61.64 2.

  

SQM broke out on May 31. This time, volume was more than twice the usual level, making it a more credible buy point.

  

But SQM had a tough time making progress in the choppy market. Once again, it pulled back to the 10-week line, where it found support 3.

  

This creates a couple of interpretations for the chart. It acts as a possible buying range after support at the 10-week line. Some chart readers might view it as another high handle, with a buy point of 62.99.

  

In both cases, the risk still exists that the market has not made a rally confirmation and technically remains in a correction.

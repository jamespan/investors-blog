With the rapid rise of mobile apps and [cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), the demand for network speed, reliability and security is also increasing. Cloud networking stock **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) has tapped into that demand. And it's now trying to tap into a new buy zone.




Based in Seattle, F5 Networks provides cloud networking infrastructure to make apps work faster, smarter and safer. It works with clients in a wide range of industries, including e-commerce and retail, financial services, and media and entertainment. Customers include service providers, governments and global consumer brands. In July, the company introduced new [cloud security solutions](https://www.f5.com/company/news/press-releases/new-f5-security-products-and-threat-research-enhance-app-protection) to help thwart the most sophisticated cyberattacks.

Cloud-Computing Profits
-----------------------


Boosted by an annual pretax profit margin of 37% and a 45% return on equity (ROE), F5 Networks earns an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/) of A. This unique rating tracks the three main ingredients needed for sustained earnings growth: sales, profit margins and ROE.


Earnings growth has been below the 25%-plus quarterly gains you prefer to see, but F5 has delivered accelerating gains in its last two reports, including a 20% jump in the June-ended quarter.


While F5 Networks did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-unitedhealth-texas-instruments-united-airlines-expeditors/), large investors have shown interest in the stock. The stock has posted three straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 46 funds with an A+ IBD rating own F5 Networks shares. The stock's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 up/down volume ratio also point to institutional demand.


With a 93 Composite Rating, F5 Networks holds the No. 1 ranking within the internet networks industry group. **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) comes in a distant second with a 76 Composite Rating. The group ranks No. 86 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Cloud-Computing Stock To Watch
------------------------------


F5 Networks is working on a first-stage flat base showing a 183.37 buy point. As the major indexes sold off on Aug. 15, F5 Networks also pulled back. But it managed to find support at the 50-day moving average and close in the upper half of its buy range.


The stock gapped up Monday to briefly clear the entry. F5 Networks ended the day up 1.4% to 183.22. Volume was below average. Look for the relative strength line to keep climbing and close in on a new high as the stock tries to re-enter the 183.37 to 192.54 buy zone.

**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) is working on a cup-with-handle base as it gets ready to report after today's market close. Tech giants like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) use Arista's cloud networking software and hardware to manage the massive amounts of data that flow between their Internet users and their data centers.

  

In June, the Silicon Valley-based firm launched EOS CloudVision, which Arista says "allows network operators to aggregate all their Arista switches and manage them as one for network-wide cloud automation."

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Over the last eight quarters, Arista's cloud has been lined with gold, as earnings growth has ranged from 92% to 238%. Revenue gains have also been strong, coming in between 51% and 137% during the same period.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 28%, followed by an 18% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Arista sports a solid 33% return on equity and a 62% annual EPS growth rate, earning it the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

The C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating is slightly below the B or better grade you'd prefer to see, but the 1.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio indicates demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public in June 2014, Arista moved higher until it began to correct last September.

  

The cup-with-handle it ended up forming is deeper than you'd prefer, with a 41% decline from peak to bottom.

  

But the stock did flash signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, including three up weeks in June where it closed near the top of the price range and volume spiked well above average.

  

Within the handle, Arista has found support at the 10-week line and has been flashing tight weekly closes. As of Thursday morning, it was again testing the 10-week moving average.

  

The traditional buy point is 88.66, 10 cents above the peak in the handle. But as [IBD noted last week](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/073115-764544-arista-networks-basing-ahead-of-report.htm), a prior point of resistance could be seen as an earlier entry, creating an alternative buy point of 88.35.

  

While Arista has shown healthy trading ahead of today's upcoming quarterly report, it's been an unforgiving earnings season.

  

So such behavior is no guarantee of how a company will report or how the market will react.

Helping Biotechs Earn FDA Drug Approvals
----------------------------------------


Based in Raleigh, NC, PRA Health is a global CRO offering clinical trial management and other drug development services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies in over 80 countries. According to the company, PRA Health Sciences has participated in trials that have led to over 75 drug approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or international regulator agencies.


For the fifth consecutive year, PRA Health Sciences was named the [International Clinical Research Company of the Year](http://investors.prahs.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253891&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2350595) by PharmaTimes.


Over the last eight quarters, PRA's earnings growth has ranged from 13% to 46%. Revenue gains have come in between 10% and 44% during the same period.

Testing Potential Breakout Move
-------------------------------


PRA Health Sciences, had its IPO in 2014, has been featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-analysis/) multiple times 2016. Since the close of its first week of trading on Nov. 14, 2014, PRA has risen 431% through Tuesday.


It's now trying to extend that run with a new breakout from a 108.12 entry in a third-stage flat base. Note that breakouts from such later-stage [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) can be risky, since the stock has already made a big move at that point.Â The relative strength line is rising, but still shy of a new 52-week high.


On Wednesday, PRA Health Sciences briefly moved into the 108.12 to 113.53 buy zone. But it closed the day below it at 107.18. Volume was above average and rising.

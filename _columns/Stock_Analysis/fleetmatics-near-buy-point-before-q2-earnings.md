With Q2 earnings season kicking into high gear, you want to keep an eye on stocks that are near a potential buy point and about to report their latest numbers.

  

Ireland-based **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) fits that bill.

  

The 2012 IPO stock has carved out a profitable niche in a market analysts say is new, big and largely untapped: Developing software to help fleet operators track vehicles and drivers.

  

That's helped it earn a spot on the [IBD Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/071415-761578-what-stock-should-i-buy.htm) list, along with fellow software developer **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) .

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Revenue growth has ranged from 26% to 40% over the last eight quarters, while earnings growth has come in at 91% and 74% in the last two reports.

  

Fleetmatics sports a stellar 100% annual EPS growth rate, but its Earnings Stability score of 40 indicates a fair amount of volatility. Keep that in mind as the company gets ready to report Q2 numbers on Aug. 6.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 17%, then climb to a 29% gain in 2016.

  

Fleetmatics' 19% ROE and 99 EPS Rating help earn it a 98 Composite Rating. And fund ownership has risen in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

From its first breakout in December 2012, Fleetmatics more than doubled in less than a year, finding good support along the 10-week moving average.

  

But that came to an end in September 2013, when the stock dropped sharply in heavy volume â€” a clear sign of institutional selling.

  

While Fleetmatics has yet to reclaim the 52.28 high it hit nearly two years ago, it has been moving closer to it.

  

The stock has been testing a 48.06 buy point in a second-stage cup-with-handle.

  

On Friday, Fleetmatics closed within the 48.06-50.46 buying range.

Food delivery app **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) is an unusual candidate for the elite [IBD 50.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) The stock is yet to turn profitable after it went public in the heyday of the pandemic.




But sales growth has been steady, ranging between 30% and 45% over the past eight quarters.


In the second quarter, sales grew 33% to $2.1 billion while a loss of 44 cents per share was better than the 72-cent loss in the prior year's quarter. Total orders grew 25% to $532 million, while Marketplace GOV, or total dollar value of completed orders, grew 26% to $16.5 billion. The company ended the quarter with $311 million in free cash flow.


For the third quarter, the company expects EBITDA of $220 million-$270 million. Analysts polled by FactSet see sales of $2.1 billion — a 24% year-on -year increase — with losses tapering off to 40 cents per share from 77 cents.


Analysts expect losses through 2023 and 2024 at $1.65 per share and 92 cents per share, respectively.


[IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) estimates show a more promising picture, with the company turning profitable with earnings of $1.35 in 2023. That may be due to a different type of earnings analysis.


The stock's chart shows a healthy pullback to the 50-day moving average in light volume this week. That could offer an aggressive entry just above 80. Shares of the growth stock have gained a hefty 69% so far this year, making the S&P 500's gains of 16% look like a flatline.


The food delivery company has a weaker [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 81. Losses put the [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) at 44, and it clearly needs improvement. The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), however, shows the stock outperforming 94% of other stocks in the IBD database.


Growth Stock Rises With New Partnerships
----------------------------------------


DoorDash was founded in 2013 to help local food businesses connect with customers. Its services has expanded beyond restaurant delivery to grocery and other non-restaurant services.


The company has entered into several partnerships in 2023. In August, a partnership with Staples Canada launched same-day delivery of back-to-school supplies through DoorDash Canada. In February, it partnered with Aldi for on-demand grocery delivery in 38 states, and with **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) to target student groups. The company faces competition from the larger **Uber's** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) delivery business, UberEats.


DASH stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 8, 2020, at an initial price of 102 per share. The stock popped 86% on the first day of trading. But the stock quickly lost momentum and fell to an all-time low of 41.37 in October 2022.


Fund ownership has been on the rise for the growth stock over the past eight quarters, with 49% of shares outstanding now with fund managers. The [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of B- also shows strong interest from institutions.

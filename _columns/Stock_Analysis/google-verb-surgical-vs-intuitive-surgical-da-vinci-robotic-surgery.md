While Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) vows to create "the future of surgery" through its Verb Surgical joint venture with **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), with its da Vinci system, remains the clear leader in robotic-assisted, minimally-invasive operations.


As [FierceBiotech](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/verb-s-huennekens-unveils-vision-next-gen-robotic-surgery) reported last month, Verb Surgical is aiming to develop a next-generation system that "incorporates robotics, advanced visualization, machine learning, data analytics and connectivity." But Verb's platform isn't expected to hit the market until 2020.


Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci is used in over 3,660 hospitals in 64 countries, with a new da Vinci surgery beginning every 60 seconds.


Flawed Fundamentals, But Solid Demand
-------------------------------------


Intuitive Surgical's three-year earnings and sales-growth rates both stand at a mere 3%, but performance has generally improved in recent quarters.


Over the last three reports, EPS gains have ranged from 20% to 23%, while sales gains have come in between 12% and 14%.


Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in Intuitive's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A and two straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing funds own shares, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).


Operation Breakout?
-------------------


Intuitive Surgical's stock went into a four-year slump after peaking at just under 600 in April 2012. But after resetting its base count at the end of last year, the stock cleared the 600 mark in April and has climbed steadily since.



Intuitive is now working on a new [flat base as part of a longer base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) formation.


The stock has shown signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, as its Relative Strength line edged into new high ground.


The stock managed to close September just above the 720.10 entry, but has failed to stay above that price in recent days.


See if Intuitive Surgical can decisively retake the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

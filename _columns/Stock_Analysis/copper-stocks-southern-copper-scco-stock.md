When Beijing rolled out a series of stimulus measures in late September, it wasn't just Chinese stocks that rallied. Copper stocks and other natural-resource shares came along for the ride.




To wit, **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) is among those coasting higher, after soaring nearly 15% in the final full week of September.


Today, the copper stock is forming a base with a 129.07 buy point, according to [MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


A more nuanced look at Southern Copper's chart pattern reveals another possible entry at 118.30, the high on July 5. Under this interpretation, Southern Copper shares formed a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) and are trying to break out right now.


In addition, the copper stock appears to be forming a handle, which creates another potential entry at 121.44. So investors have multiple ways to consider a purchase.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is trending higher but is still below the prior high from May. Prudent investors may wait until it gets closer to new highs.


Institutional Investors Rush Into Copper Stock
----------------------------------------------


There's little doubt that institutional investors recognize the value of copper stocks, and they've poured into Southern Copper. The stock's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) has gone from D to B in the past month.



Southern Copper leads the metal ores mining industry group with a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99. There are 48 companies in the group.


The company is majority-owned by Grupo Mexico, a mining, transportation and infrastructure conglomerate. Southern Copper operates in Peru through a subsidiary and also owns Minera Mexico, the largest mining company in Mexico.


Copper is the company's principal metal, accounting for more than 56% of its tonnage in 2023. The company also mines for molybdenum — used to make alloys — along with zinc and silver.


In the second quarter, earnings and sales for the copper stock snapped out of a slump with an earnings gain of 74% a share. Southern Copper posted a sales increase of 36%, according to FactSet.


Analyst estimates haven't changed much since the China news. They call for earnings to increase 44% in the third quarter, with sales rising 18% to $2.952 billion.


Shares Follow Commodity Prices
------------------------------


Like other commodity-based stocks, Southern Copper's share price tends to shadow the price of copper. Yet, the stock has outperformed the commodity year to date, up more than 37% vs. a 20% increase for United States Copper Index ([CPER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPER)) exchange traded fund.


On Wednesday, Comex copper for October delivery gained 1.3% to $4.5960 per pound. That's up nearly 25% from its 2024 closing low of $3.686 marked Feb. 9 and more than 18% higher year to date, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Copper prices have been rallying since Chinese officials [took steps to shore up](https://www.investors.com/news/china-stocks-baba-cat-fcx-climb-on-more-beijing-stimulus/) the country's real estate market and other important parts of the economy.


"Investors seeking other proxies for Chinese upside may also look to copper — which remains our preferred metal," copper stock strategists at UBS noted in a Sept. 27 report.

In both bull and bear markets, focus on top-rated stocks in the top-ranked industry groups when building your watch list. As the No. 1 stock in the No. 4-ranked Auto/Truck-Replacement Parts industry group, auto parts supplier **Dorman Products** ([DORM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DORM)) fits that bill.




In a further sign of institutional demand for auto parts stocks, the auto parts retailers group holds the No. 2 group ranking. **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), earns top billing among its peers with a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/).


This could be a sign that funds and other large investors see trouble for the economy andÂ [stock market trends in 2019](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-for-2019/). In weaker economies, people tend to repair their vehicles rather than purchase new ones, creating more business for auto parts companies. But the big gain in the latest [jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-december-fed-chairman-powell/) may indicate a brighter outlook.

Auto Parts Supplier With Rising Growth

Founded in 1918, Dorman is a leading supplier of automotive replacement parts, brake products, and automotive hardware to the aftermarket and mass merchandise markets. The Pennsylvania-based company's lineup includes over 150,000 products under its eponymous brand name and other labels such as AutoGrade, TECHoice and First Stop.


Dorman has posted three quarters of rising earnings and sales growth. In Q3, revenue gains climbed from 4% to 10%, while earnings-per-share increased 31%, up from a 30% gain in the second quarter.


Analyst earnings estimates for 2018 (25%) and 2019 (10%) were both recently revised higher.


In a sign of demand for shares, Dorman sports a 1.8 up/down ratio and saw rising fund ownership in Q3.


Is Dorman Revving Up To Break Out In New Market Uptrend?
--------------------------------------------------------


In May, Dorman undercut the low in a prior consolidation to [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). Since June, it's been working on a first-stage [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/).


The stock is currently trying to complete the third installment within that base-on-base, showing a 91.42 buy point. In a sign of resilience and market leadership, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is already floating near new-high ground.


Keep in mind that the market remains volatile, but we did see a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/) on Jan. 4 to [launch a new uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970). So continue to watch stocks like Dorman that have solid fundamentals and are setting up in new [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). These are often the stocks that take off when a new bull market begins.


In early trading Monday, Dorman is testing the buy point as it rises nearly 4%. Volume is trending more than twice its daily average. Dorman's RS line has also just hit a new high, a sign that it continues to outperform the general market.

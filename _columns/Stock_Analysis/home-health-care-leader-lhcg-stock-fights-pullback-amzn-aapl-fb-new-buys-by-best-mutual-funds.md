As tech stocks like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) take a hit, home health care provider **LHC Group** ([LHCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHCG)) is trying to resist the sell-off and break out to an all-time high.




Like Amazon, Apple, Adobe and Facebook, LHC Group made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buying-tech-stocks-including-amazon-zoom-nvidia-microsoft-alibaba-facebook/).


For the most recent reporting period, 23 funds invested $68 million in the hospice and health care firm. Plus, 110 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD have reported owning the stock.


In a further sign of solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), LHC Group has posted eight quarters of rising fund ownership.

LHC Group Reaches 60% Of U.S. Elderly Population
------------------------------------------------


Based in Louisiana, LHC Group has over 32,000 employees operating in 35 states and the District of Columbia. Providing home health care, hospice, community and facility-based care services, the company reaches 60% of the U.S. population age 65 and older.


Founded in 1994 as a single home health agency in small-town America, LHC Group is now the preferred home health care partner for 350 leading hospitals around the country.


From a 23% slowdown in earnings in Q1, LHC Group posted EPS growth of 15% last quarter. The company has posted average annual earnings growth of 30% over the last three years.


Home Health Care Leader Stock Gains 1,300%
------------------------------------------


The stock doesn't receive the buzz of leading tech titans such as Amazon, Apple, Adobe and Facebook. But its gains have been quietly impressive. Since hitting a bottom in January 2012, LHC Group soared over 1,300% through the end of August of this year.


The stock is currently forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 215.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


While Amazon, Facebook and Apple have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, LHC shares are so far holding support above that benchmark line. LHCG stock came of its lows Friday to close above it.


It's risky to buy any stock during this period of stock market volatility. See if LHC stock can maintain support and stock market conditions stabilize. With LHC's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) still within striking distance of a new 52-week high, a heavy-volume breakout could present a buying opportunity if the stock market trend rebounds.


LHC Group had a strong close Friday, retaking its 50-day line in heavy volume in the final hour of trading.

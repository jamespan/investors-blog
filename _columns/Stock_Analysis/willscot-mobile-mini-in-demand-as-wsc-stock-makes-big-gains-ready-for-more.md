WillScot Mobile Mini Still In Demand After 544%Gain
---------------------------------------------------


WSC stock sports a very strong 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). Industry peers **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), **Herc** ([HRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRI)), **McGrath** ([MGRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGRC)) and  **Ryder System** ([R](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=R)) all earn the highest-possible 99 rating.


The Commercial Services-Leasing category is one the [strongest industry groups](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-watch-in-top-ranked-industry-groups/), ranking No. 9 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


From the March 2002 low, WillScot Mobile Mini has booked a mighty gain of around 544%. It's had its dips and dings along the way but the stock has generally found support along its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


The company did not make last month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-on-5ech-stocks-including-11-semiconductor-stocks/) but 54 funds with an "A+" rating from IBD own shares in WSC stock. The number of funds with a position in WillScot Mobile Mini has risen from 619 in March 2022 to 778 in Q4 of this year. Well-known Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) has a position.


Over the last three quarters, Willscot Mobile Mini has posted average earnings growth of 218%, including a 63% gain in Q3, to 39 cents per share. The storage solutions company is set to report Q4 and full-year metrics on Feb. 21. Wall Street estimates call for 27% growth in the fourth quarter and an 81% EPS gain for 2022.

WSC Stock Stores Up For Potential New Run
-----------------------------------------


WillScot Mobile Mini has crafted a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) showing a 49.12 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Despite its already massive move, it's technically considered a first-stage consolidation since WSC stock undercut the low in its prior chart pattern, resetting [the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has moved sideways as the flat base has formed, but it remains near a 52-week high.


In a sign of resilience, WSC stock rebounded off its lows Friday. Also note the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has moved back above the longer-term 50-day line, and the stock found support at the 21-day line this week. This improving technical strength bodes well for WillScot Mobile Mini as the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) build on the new uptrend.

As artificial intelligence revolutionizes business intelligence and how companies operate, institutional investors are investing heavily in AI stocks like **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)). In fact, over the last three months, 42 of the best mutual funds scooped up approximately $1.1 billion worth of shares in Splunk stock.




In the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-splunk-stock-netflix-stock/), Splunk is joined by fellow database software firm **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)), as well as several cloud-based enterprise software companies like **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)).

AI Stocks To Watch: No. 1-Rated Stock In No. 4-Ranked Industry
--------------------------------------------------------------


Over the last three years, Splunk has generated average annual earnings growth of 78%. It's set to report results for Q4 and its full fiscal year (ended last Jan. 31) on Feb. 28 after the market close. Consensus analyst EPS estimates are calling for a 105% gain.


Analysts also expect a 70% increase in earnings per share for the full fiscal year, followed by a 38% rise in fiscal 2020. Analysts have revised higher the estimates for both years.


Splunk has grown revenue over the last three years at an average annual pace of 37%.


With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Splunk earns top billing in the database software industry.  Tableau Software holds the No. 2 spot with a 98 rating. The group ranks No. 4 among the 197 industries IBD tracks, another sign of institutional demand for stocks in that field.


Splunk Stock Resets Base Count; Nears Breakout
----------------------------------------------


Splunk pulled back to form a new base during the bear market at the end of last year. While building that consolidation, it [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) by undercutting the low in its prior base, making the current [cup-shaped pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) a lower-risk first-stage consolidation.


The potential buy point is 130.10. Splunk briefly cleared that entry on Feb. 4 in light volume, but has so far failed to close above it.


Splunk stock, however, has been flashing signs of a technical rebound. It's currently on pace to close higher for a seventh straight week, and its relative strength line is just shy of a new 52-week high. The 10-week moving average has also just moved back above its longer-term 40-week line.


On Thursday, Splunk recouped morning losses to close flat at 128.21. On Friday, it again managed a bullish reversal to close in buy range, but volume was light.


As evidenced in Friday's action, the missing ingredient in Splunk's recent run-up has been volume. Look for heavy trade to kick in to show conviction for a new run.



[Tableau Software gapped down](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tableau-earnings-tableau-stock-q4-2018/) sharply after reporting earnings on Feb. 5. The stock has now fallen out of buy range and is trying to hold support at its 50-day moving average. It managed to erase Friday's early losses and close in positive territory, but it remains just below that benchmark line.

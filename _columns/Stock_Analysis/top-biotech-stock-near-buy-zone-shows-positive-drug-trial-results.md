On Monday, leading drugmaker **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) announced positive Phase 3 trial results for its psoriasis treatment, risankizumab. On Tuesday, the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) was up fractionally and within 3% of a potential new buy zone.









 
 
 Results of the ongoing study showed that "nearly half (47%) of risankizumab patients achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) vs. placebo (1%) at week 16."
AbbVie, which generated just under $7 billion in revenue in Q3, is a megacap medical stock, with a market cap of north of $150 billion.


It's joined on the IBD Big Cap 20 by fellow medical stocks **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)).


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) was dropped from list after the maker of the da Vinci robot-assisted surgical system fell nearly 7% in volume 155% higher than normal Monday. On Tuesday, the stock tried, but failed to retake its 50-day moving average.


Align Technology, which has a proprietary system for treating maloccclusion or teeth misalignment, also sold off Monday, but has managed to stay above that benchmark line. The stock edged 0.7% higher Tuesday.


Like AbbVie, Edwards Lifesciences is working on a new base, and managed health care provider Centene, which broke out last week, is again testing the 98.82 buy point. Centene has bounced back into buy range with a 1.7% rise Tuesday and closed the session 1% above the buy point.


Dividend Stock With Growth
--------------------------


For a company of its size, AbbVie continues to generate solid growth, with revenue gains ranging from 8% to 18% over the last eight quarters.


The North Chicago, Ill.-based company has posted three straight quarters of rising earnings growth, with bottom line gains ranging rising from 6% to 17% over that period.


Plus, AbbVie also pays a dividend currently yielding 2.9% on an annual basis. (Check out IBD's new special report on income investing for tips on [how to generate income without taking big risks](https://www.investors.com/dividend-and-income-investing/).)


Support For Another Breakout?
-----------------------------


AbbVie blasted past a 75.14 buy point in early September, reaching a peak of 98.26 on Oct. 20 before pulling back to begin forming its current second-stage flat base.



While forming that chart pattern, AbbVie sold off sharply on Oct. 26, but found support at the 50-day moving average and bounced back to close the day in near the top of the day's price range.


Since then, the stock has continued to edge higher as it closes in on the 98.36 buy point.


While AbbVie slipped over 1% Monday, volume was below average and the stock found support right around its 10-day line. On Tuesday, AbbVie gave back most of its morning gains, but managed to close the day up fractionally.


Look for the indexes to rebound from the recent selling pressure and see if AbbVie can climb into buy range in heavy volume.

As Q1 earnings rolls on, **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) shares a key [common trait of winning stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) with [IBD 50 members](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)): rising ownership by mutual funds and other institutional investors.




Planet Fitness, which [just returned to the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-planet-fitness-joins-ibd-50/), and artificial intelligence technology leader Nvidia have both posted eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 28 funds with an A+ rating have reported a position in Planet Fitness, while 253 A+ funds own Nvidia.


Netflix, which soared 9% Tuesday after [smashing Q1 subscriber targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-jumps-on-earnings/), has seen rising fund ownership for seven straight quarters. Meanwhile, Grubhub has shown an increase for four consecutive quarters.


Strong institutional demand, particularly among the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-stocks-to-watch-adobe-abiomed-constellation-brands/), is a key factor in driving big price moves by the [market's top stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/).


Q1 Earnings Preview
-------------------


Founded in New Hampshire in 1992, Planet Fitness now has over 1,400 non-intimidating workout centers, known as "Judgement Free Zones."


With the recent opening of its first location in Hawaii, Planet Fitness now has a presence in all 50 states, as well in Puerto Rico, Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama. Earlier this year, the company announced it will open a new facility in Mexico.

Consensus analyst estimates call for Nvidia to deliver an 83% gain in earnings in its next report, and for a 34% from Grubhub.


Planet Fitness Pumps Up New Breakout
------------------------------------


Planet Fitness has delivered a healthy run for investors since its 2015 IPO. On Tuesday, the stock cleared a 40.14 buy point in a flat base, which is part of a longer second-stage base-on-base.


The relative strength line just hit new-high ground, and the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.8 up/down volume ratio further confirms institutional demand for shares in Planet Fitness.


On Wednesday, Planet Fitness rose another 0.8% to close the day 2% above the entry. The buy range extends to 42.15.



Netflix was off just 0.5% Wednesday after a 9% gain the day before. Nvidia gained 2.6% to retake its 50-day moving average Tuesday, and manage to close Wednesday's session just above that benchmark line. Nvidia has been consolidating after [rising well over 500% after being highlighted in the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


Grubhub has also been consolidating, but rose over 5% Tuesday, as it bounced off its 50-day line in rising volume. On Wednesday, it received an analyst downgrade, pushing it back to down to its 50-day line. But the online food-ordering service leader found support at that benchmark and came well off the day's lows to end the day down just 0.6%.

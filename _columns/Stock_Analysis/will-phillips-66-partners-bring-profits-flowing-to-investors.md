Today we're going to look at **Phillips 66 Partners** ([PSXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSXP)), which operates oil and refined petroleum product pipelines and terminals. The firm was founded as a subsidiary of **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)), the oil and gas giant.

  

As a Dec. 10 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/120913-682219-phillips-66-partners-midstream-oil-and-gas.htm) article noted, most of its sales come from charging tariffs and fees for transporting and storing crude oil and refined petroleum products for Phillips 66.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth ranged from 36% to 69% the past three quarters. 

  

• Sales growth came in between 15% and 42% during the past four quarters. 

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 56% this year and 35% next year. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-phillips-66-partners-lp-psxp.aspx) shows the stock carries a 79 Composite Rating, the fourth highest in its industry group.

  

But the group is only ranked No. 162 among IBD's 197 groups. So it hasn't been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Turning to the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Phillips came public in July and has now carved out a long cup-with-handle base.

  

To find the ideal buy point in that pattern, just add 10 cents to the peak in the handle.

  

You could also look the most recent portion of the pattern as a flat base, because the price only dropped 12% as it formed. Flat bases involve price drops of 15% or less.

  

The ideal buy point in that pattern is the same as if we looked at it's a cup-with-handle base, so don't get too caught up on the terminology.

  

Watch to see if Phillips can break out past that buy point on volume that's at least 40% above average. If it does, it could create a buying opportunity.

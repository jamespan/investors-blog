Earlier this week, a [hot inflation report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-sliding-but-this-is-what-matters-for-the-fed-and-dow-jones/) slammed the market indexes. But oil stock **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) has managed to buck that drop and prime a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). COP stock continues to test the new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).




Showing the broad strength of the [energy sector](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/), ConocoPhillips is among four stocks with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) in the Oil & Gas-International Exploration & Production industry group. Other leaders include **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)), **Ovintiv** ([OVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVV)) and [Warren Buffett](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks/) favorite **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)).


The group ranks No. 6 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Further indicating strength in the wider oil sector, many other names, such as **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)), **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) have also fueled a 99 Composite Rating within the U.S. Exploration & Production group.


This U.S. oil and gas group ranks an even stronger No. 4.

ConocoPhillips Joins Pioneer, Devon In Methane Initiative
---------------------------------------------------------


Based in Houston, ConocoPhillips is one of the world's leading oil exploration and production companies. With a globally diversified asset portfolio, it has operations and activities in 13 countries with approximately 9,400 employees.


In July, ConocoPhillips joined fellow oil stocks Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy in the [Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 Initiative](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/pioneer-devon-and-conocophillips-join-ogmp-2-0-commit-to-leading-methane-performance-and-increased-transparency-in-emissions-reporting/). OGMP 2.0 has emerged as a global gold standard for methane emissions measurement and reporting.


In addition to a commitment to improve the oil and gas industry's transparency in methane emissions reporting, ConocoPhillips and other members will encourage progress in reducing those emissions. The goal is to reduce methane emissions while meeting U.S. and global energy demand with reliable and responsibly sourced production.


Oil & Gas Stocks Dominate New Buys By The Best Mutual Funds
-----------------------------------------------------------


As energy stocks have led for much of 2022, ConocoPhillips made the latest of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-over-1-billion-on-five-stocks-including-apple-nasdaq-xom-lly-unh/). **ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), **NextEra Energy** ([NEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEE)) and many other oil and gas stocks also made this [stock screen](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/). PXD, CLR, DVN, OXY also joined COP stock as top money managers continued to show demand for the sector.


ConocoPhillips Fueling Huge Sales & Earnings Growth
---------------------------------------------------


Given its sales and earnings performance in 2021 and this year, it's no wonder that the best mutual funds have had their eye on ConocoPhillips.


Last quarter, the company generated 208% earnings growth. Analysts forecast 125% EPS growth for the current quarter and a 156% increase for the full year.


Over the last six quarters, sales growth has ranged from 83% to 165%.


COP Stock Energizes Buy Zone In Late-Stage Base
-----------------------------------------------


As the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) struggle to make a stand following Tuesday's rout, ConocoPhillips is testing a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). COP stock has slipped just below its 115.57 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a late-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Keep in mind that later-stage chart patterns are more prone to failure and ConocoPhillips has already made a big move since a breakout in January 2021.


Yet COP stock continues to lead, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) rising and just shy of a 52-week high. On Friday, ConocoPhillips ended the week 2% below the buy point, but managed to close off its lows. The stock rose in the final hours of trading.


For late-stage bases amid market volatility, keep close tabs on the [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). Investors that choose to buy into a later-stage base while inflation has the major stock market indexes trading below key moving averages should understand the risk. Look for breakouts in stocks like ConocoPhillips to be backed up by heavy trade on the upside.

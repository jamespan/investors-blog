The stock market kicked off 2016 with a stubbed toe, but **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) got an upgrade to "overweight" by Morgan Stanley as the maker of the da Vinci Surgical System tries to buck the downturn and break out of a first-stage base.

  

Intuitive Surgical is the clear leader in robotic surgery platforms that enable surgeons to perform precise, minimally invasive operations.

  

According to a 2015 survey by RBC Capital Markets, U.S. surgeons expect a [sharp increase in robot-assisted surgeries](http://news.investors.com/technology/101915-776238-intuitive-surgical-seen-benefiting-from-robot-surgery-growth.htm) in the coming years. The percentage of procedures that use robots could increase from 15% in 2015 to 35% over the next five years.

  

**V Is For Verily**

  

RBC noted a high satisfaction rate for the da Vinci system among surgeons, making it difficult for competitors like **TransEnterix** ([TRXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRXC)) to grab market share. But Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is teaming up with **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) to challenge Intuitive Surgical's dominance.

  

While details have not been released, the health care giant and Alphabet's Verily unit (formerly known as Life Sciences) are forming a [medical robotics partnership](http://news.investors.com/technology/121015-784659-google-jandj-robotics-move-targets-intuitive-surgical-.htm) that may initially focus on international markets.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Like a patient recovering from a da Vinci procedure, Intuitive Surgical's earnings have been rebounding rapidly. Earnings-per-share have gone from four quarters of negative growth in 2014 to a 34% gain in Q3. Fourth quarter numbers are expected later this month.

  

Analysts expect 2015 earnings to come in 14% higher, followed by a 10% gain this year.

  

Overall, the stock earns a 98 Composite Rating and the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Its 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio shows demand for the stock. Also, the number of funds that own shares jumped last quarter from 1,194 to 1,225, and two typically better-performing mutual funds have a position in Intuitive Surgical: Franklin Growth and American Century All Cap Growth .

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Intuitive Surgical [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/getting-started-counting-bases/) in October, when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern. That makes its current consolidation a first-stage base.

  

The stock has shown technical strength in the right side of the consolidation.

  

The 10-week moving average got back above the 40-week line last month, and four weeks of tight closes near the top of the price range in November and December point to institutional accumulation. Also, the Relative Strength line has been trending higher and is in new high ground ahead of a potential breakout.

  

Despite a sharp drop in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on the year's first day of trading Jan. 4, Intuitive Surgical managed to close the day slightly higher.

  

The current buy point is 564.96, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

It takes at least five days to form a handle, and Tuesday is day No. 4. If Intuitive Surgical completes that formation, the buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

  

The elephant in the room, however, is the general market, which fell back into a correction on Monday.

  

It's risky to buy any stock in a market downturn, but see if Intuitive Surgical can continue to show resilience and deliver strong Q4 numbers when it reports later this month.

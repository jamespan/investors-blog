From semiconductors and smart devices to self-driving cars and industrial automation, [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) is getting woven into all aspects of our lives. Automation technology and testing pioneer **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) is helping to drive that revolution, making it one of the top AI stocks to watch.




Founded in 1960 and based in Boston, Teradyne provides advanced task automation and electronic testing for technology companies in the semiconductor, defense and aerospace, automotive, data storage and other industries. With approximately 5,500 employees worldwide, Teradyne is a leader in industrial automation and autonomous mobile robots, collaborative robots, and motion-control software.


As Teradyne stock gapped up Friday to close in on a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), the company has just begun volume shipping of its [Magnum EPIC memory tester](http://investors.teradyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/teradyne-begins-volume-shipping-magnum-epic-testing-leading-edge) to help accelerate 5G technology. According to Teradyne, "these next-generation memories deliver nearly twice the bandwidth of the previous generation to improve the performance of 5G smartphones, data centers, and high definition graphics applications."


Teradyne has the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning it's outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Teradyne stock ties **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) for the No. 1 spot in the [semiconductor equipment industry group](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/), which ranks No. 21 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)), **FormFactor** ([FORM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FORM)) and **Ultra Clean** ([UCTT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UCTT)) round out the top 5 industry leaders.


Teradyne stock has earned a spot on both the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/).


Best Mutual Funds Invest $61 Million In Teradyne
------------------------------------------------


One reason for Teradyne being among the top AI stocks to watch is its strong [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/). In IBD's latest report on [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-find-stocks-to-watch-amzn-aapl-msft-nvda-nflx/), 11 top money managers invested approximately $61 million in Teradyne. Plus, 81 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning the stock.


Teradyne posted strong and accelerating earnings (85%) and sales (43%) growth last quarter. The company also sports a solid 25.8% annual pretax profit margin and 32.9% return on equity.


Teradyne stock has seen five quarters of rising fund ownership.


Teradyne Among Top AI Stocks Near A Buy Point
---------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hitting a new 52-week high, Teradyne is showing a strong technical rebound after selling off in the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/). On Wednesday, the stock gapped up to more than a 4% gain in rising volume. It gapped up again Friday, jumping 5% to lift the stock to within 6% of a new 81.67 entry.


The 10-week line is trying to climb above the 40-week moving average. It's a sign of technical resilience when the shorter-term line crosses above the longer-term moving average.


A breakout would push Teradyne into a new all-time high.

Boosted by 300% earnings growth last quarter, portable storage leader **WillScot Mobile Mini** ([WSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSC)) is trying to complete a base while the market sells off in the current [correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/). In a sign of leadership in a downturn, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) remains at a new high.

Growth Stock Takes Bumpy Road Toward Buy Point
----------------------------------------------


While exhibiting unusual relative strength, WillScot is not immune to the turbulence in the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Reflecting that [volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/), the stock has formed multiple [double bottoms](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), a common [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/) in rocky times.


Earlier this week, the stock moved within striking distance of a 43.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). But as the market sold off into the week's close, WillScot also declined.


It fell again Friday, falling below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) in volume trending well above average. The stock did manage to come off its lows for the day, closing just below its 50-day line.


While the general market and WillScot encounter selling pressure, the stock's price action in key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) is worth noting.


The [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) crossed back above the longer-term 200-day benchmark earlier this month. WillScot is now trying to hold support at its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


While recent broad-based selling pressure is a warning sign for all stocks, WillScot Mobile Mini continues to display market-leading strength and resilience.


Supplemented by strong growth and impressive estimates, the portable storage leader could be poised for a big move when the market rebounds.

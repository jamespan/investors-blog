After successful IPOs from **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Cotiviti Holdings** ([COTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COTV)) and others, clinical research organization **Medpace Holdings** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) made its market debut Thursday. Time will tell if Medpace becomes a Wall Street favorite, but in the meantime investors should also keep an eye on a rival CRO, **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)).


Much larger than Medpace, PRA posted $456 million in revenue for Q2, compared to Medpace's $106 million. PRA's 18% return on equity also tops Medpace's 10% ROE, helping the former generate strong three-year growth rates for earnings (130%) and sales (29%).


PRA holds the No. 1 ranking within the medical research industry group, ahead of **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), **Bio-Techne** ([TECH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECH)), **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) and **Luminex** ([LMNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMNX)). Medpace has not yet been ranked.


Based in North Carolina, PRA has over 11,000 employees operating in more than 80 countries, and was recently named the "[International Clinical Company of the Year](http://prahs.com/news/pra-named-international-clinical-company-year/)" for the second straight year. By comparison, Medpace is active in 35 countries with a workforce of approximately 2,300 people.


Testing New Buy Point
---------------------


From a 20.90 closing price at the end of its first week of trading in November 2014 until the end of July 2015, PRA Health Sciences rose as much as 110%.


Since January of this year, however, the stock has been hitting resistance around 50, which it did again earlier this month. The stock completed a handle this week, establishing a 50.06 buy point.


Signs of institutional demand include an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio, six quarters of rising fund ownership and two heavy-volume up-weeks in the right side of the base.


Look for PRA Health Sciences to clear the buy point in heavy volume and move decisively above its recent area of resistance.

Today we're going to look at **Navigator Holdings** ([NVGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVGS)), which was featured in a Jan. 14 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/011314-686138-navigator-holdings-lpg-ships-sail-amid-gas-exports.htm). It's a shipping company that's based in the U.K. and has been riding the wave of growth in the American oil and gas industry, particularly exports.

  

The firm has the world's largest fleet of "handysize" seaborne gas carriers. Handysize is an industry term for ships that can get into smaller ports.

  

Navigator transports liquefied petroleum gases — also known as LPGs — like propane, butane, ammonia and others.

  

And some of the big shale oil and gas plays like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus are producing a lot of LPG as a byproduct of the oil and gas drilling.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• And so far, Navigator seems to have carved out a comfortable niche for itself. 

  

• The stock came public in Nov. 

  

• Sometimes, prior to an IPO only annual earnings and sales numbers —rather than quarterly numbers — are available. So that's why Navigator's numbers don't vary quarter to quarter. 

  

• For the full year, analysts estimate earnings climbed 73% in 2013 and will rise 55% in 2014. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-navigator-holdings-ltd-nvgs.aspx) shows Navigator's 92 Composite Rating is the fourth highest among the 50 stocks in the Transportation-Ship industry group.

  

And the group as a whole is ranked No. 39 among IBD's 197 industries.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After coming public in Nov., Navigator began to climb.

  

A good strategy is to wait to get onboard until a stock settles down after its IPO and carves out its first base pattern.

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Navigator recently did just that, forming a short base. Patterns like that, which occur after a stock comes public, can be shorter than traditional bases.

  

To find the 27.23 ideal buy point, just add 10 cents to the peak on the left side of the base. Navigator tried to break out past that buy point Friday, but finished the day just below it. The stock hasn't been trading long enough to have a 50-day moving average volume line.

  

And as of Tues. morning, the stock was trading below that ideal buy point. So it may be worth keeping an eye on to see if it makes another breakout attempt.

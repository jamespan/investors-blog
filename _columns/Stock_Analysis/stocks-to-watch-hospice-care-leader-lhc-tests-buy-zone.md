No. 1-Ranked Hospice Care Provider
----------------------------------


LHC holds the No. 1 ranking among in-home health care and hospice care providers. **Addus Homecare** ([ADUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADUS)) and **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) are also among leaders in the group, which ranks a lowly No. 107 among 197 groups IBD tracks.


Boosted by the closure of its [merger with Almost Family](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2018/04/lhc-group-closes-almost-family-merger-charts-future-course/) for $850 million last year, LHC's revenue soared 95% in Q2 and 88% in Q3. After posting sales of just under $270 million in Q3 2017, the company generated over $500 million in both the second and third quarters of 2018.


By comparison, Amedisys generated $417 million in Q3, while Addus Homecare ($138 million) and U.S. Physical Therapy ($113 million) both came in under $150 million for the quarter.


LHC has posted three quarters of rising earnings growth rate, including a jump from 33% in Q2 to 48% in Q3. Analysts are looking for a 64% EPS gain when the company reports Q4 numbers, expected around late February. For full-year 2018, consensus analyst estimates call for a 48% rise in earnings, followed by a 19% increase in 2019.


A 1.1 up/down volume ratio, B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and three quarters of rising fund ownership indicate demand for the stock.


Stocks To Watch: Rising Relative Strength
-----------------------------------------


From a low of 32.04 that LHC hit in November 2016, the stock rose 138% to 107.51 by November 2018. As a bear market took hold at the end of last year, LHC also pulled back.


In November, the stock tried to break out of a cup with handle base, but it failed to gain traction after hitting its 107.51 peak. It corrected 18% within a new consolidation, but note how the low in the new base was higher than the low in the prior pattern. When a stock establishes higher lows (as opposed to falling to *lower* lows), it can be a sign of an emerging technical rebound.


On Jan. 23, the stock briefly cleared the 107.61 entry in its current cup base, but closed the day below it. Since then, LHC has been floating in and out of the 107.61-to-113 buy range in lackluster volume.


In a sign of market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is trending higher and near new-high ground. Unlike many stocks that were hit harder in the recent [market correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), LHC's 10-week moving average remains well above its longer-term 40-week line, an indicator of technical resilience.


If the stock manages to retake its buy point, look for volume to be at least 40% above average. Especially given the hesitation seen in its earlier breakout attempts, you want to see heavy trade kick in to show conviction for the move among large investors.


LHC finished strong at the end of Friday's session, erasing all of the day's losses to end with a 0.8% gain in heavy volume. At 106.61, the stock is now just 1% below the entry.

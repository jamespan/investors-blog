In a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) that damaged most stocks, [Big Pharma](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) distribution giant **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)) stayed healthy — until now. After continuing to rise since joining industry peers **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) and **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)) in an opioid settlement earlier in the year, the stock has gapped down at the open in huge volume on Thursday.




As the top-ranked leader among drug distributors, AmerisourceBergen earns a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). With a 96 Composite, McKesson also rates well in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Cardinal Health earns an 83 Composite Rating. The industry group ranks a strong No. 11 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


In a sign of strong institutional demand, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson both secured placement on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-aapl-brkb-pm-stock-in-market-correction-as-new-uptrend-awaits/). ABC stock further confirms its leadership with a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).

AmerisourceBergen Joins Peers In Approving Opioid Settlement
------------------------------------------------------------


In February, AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health determined there was sufficient participation among states and other litigants to proceed with an [opioid settlement](https://investor.amerisourcebergen.com/news/news-details/2022/Distributors-Approve-Opioid-Settlement-Agreement/default.aspx). On May 3, the [state of Washington](https://investor.amerisourcebergen.com/news/news-details/2022/Distributors-Agree-to-Opioid-Settlement-With-Washington-State/default.aspx) announced it would also join the agreement.


While all three companies continue to strongly dispute the allegations made against them, they believe implementation of the settlement is a key milestone toward achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. The settlement is seen as a way to provide meaningful relief to communities across the U.S. that have been impacted by the opioid epidemic.


Payable over the next 18 years, the settlement calls for AmerisourceBergen to contribute approximately $6.1 billion, with McKesson ($7.4 billion) and Cardinal Health ($6 billion) also contributing.


The states of Alabama and Oklahoma chose not to participate in the settlement.


AmerisourceBergen Not Immune To Market Correction
-------------------------------------------------


Damage in the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) has been severe. AmerisourceBergen had been showing resilience and strength in the face of that downturn, but now shows how no stocks are immune. At Thursday's open, ABC stock broke below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/), and its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) reversed course after trending sharply higher. The weekly RS line remains strong.


AmerisourceBergen managed to come off its lows and rise again Friday, but the stock remains below its 50-day line.


The sharp drop came as **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) [sold six million shares of ABC stock](https://www.yahoo.com/now/walgreens-boots-alliance-sells-six-214700383.html). The news and the [stock's reaction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-news-reaction-can-tell-more-about-the-stock-than-the-news/) only reinforce why it's best to avoid new buys during a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/).


At the same time, don't ignore the market. Keep an eye out for the indexes to eventually establish a bottom and flash a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) to signal a new uptrend.

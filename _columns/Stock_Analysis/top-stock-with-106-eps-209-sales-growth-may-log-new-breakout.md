If you're looking for stocks to watch that have explosive earnings and sales growth and are nearing a potential breakout, keep an eye on **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)).


The online collaboration and remote-access services leader got a big boost last July when it announced a merger with Citrix's GetGo subsidiary, adding GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and other products into its lineup. The transaction was valued at $1.8 billion.









 
 
 On Aug. 1, LogMeIn announced it was acquiring Nanorep, an Israeli chatbot and virtual assistant company that used artificial intelligence to enhance and enable self-service solutions for customer service and other needs.
**Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), Toys R Us, **Vodafone** ([VOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VOD)) and other major brands already use Nanorep.


According to LogMeIn's press release announcing the purchase, research firm Gartner says the percentage of customer service experiences handled by chatbots and similar AI-driven technologies could rise from 3% this year to 30% by 2022.


Triple-Digit Growth
-------------------


LogMeIn has posted two straight quarters of triple-digit gains for both the top and bottom lines, with Q2 earnings and revenue growth coming in at 106% and 209%, respectively.


Boosted by a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% return on equity, the Boston-based company holds the No. 1 spot among its peers in the enterprise software group. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) round out the top five.


One yellow flag is the 8% drop last quarter in the number of funds that own LogMeIn, as shown in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Look for that trend to reverse in Q3.


Forming Cup With Handle
-----------------------


LogMeIn is working on an early-stage cup with handle with a 121.35 buy point.



The stock weathered last week's market sell-off well, finding support at its 50-day line in volume that stayed below average, as you like to see on a pullback.


On Monday, LogMeIn jumped more than 3%, putting it within 3% of the breakout price. The relative strength line moved closer to new high ground, but volume was below average. As of Wednesday morning, the stock was trading 4% below the buy zone.


See if LogMeIn can jump past the entry in heavy trade to show conviction for the move.

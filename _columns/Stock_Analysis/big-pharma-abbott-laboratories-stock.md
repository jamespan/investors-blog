**Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) didn't join **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)), **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and nine other medical sector stocks on latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/warren-buffett-berkshire-walgreens-starbucks-best-mutual-funds-buys/). But the Big Pharma and medical devices company has seen five quarters of rising fund ownership. And it may be setting up a new breakout move.




Based in Abbott Park, IL., Abbott Laboratories develops generic drugs, medical devices, diagnostic systems and nutritional supplements. With a [96 Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), it beats out **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) for the top spot in the two-member Medical-Diversified industry group.


The group ranks No. 28 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. In further evidence of solid institutional demand for health care and pharmaceutical stocks, the medical sector ranks No. 3 among [IBD's 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).

Dividend-Paying Big Pharma Stock
--------------------------------


Tracing its roots back to 1888, Abbott Laboratories has delivered [94 consecutive years](http://dam.abbott.com/en-us/abbottcorpnews/pdf/Abbott-Corporate-Infographic-1Q-2018.pdf) of paying a quarterly dividend. The company currently pays a dividend yielding 1.6% on an annualized basis.


In addition to branded generic drugs, Abbott also develops medical devices, including the HeartMate 3 heart pump. Last month, HeartMate received [FDA approval](http://abbott.mediaroom.com/2018-10-19-Abbotts-HeartMate-3-Heart-Pump-Now-FDA-Approved-for-Advanced-Heart-Failure-Patients-Not-Eligible-for-a-Heart-Transplant) for advanced heart-failure patients who are not eligible for a heart transplant.


In October, Abbott also announced that the FDA cleared its next-generation [influenza A&B 2 and strep A 2 molecular assays](http://abbott.mediaroom.com/2018-10-19-Abbotts-HeartMate-3-Heart-Pump-Now-FDA-Approved-for-Advanced-Heart-Failure-Patients-Not-Eligible-for-a-Heart-Transplant) for point-of-care testing. The company says these tests enable the "fastest-ever time to molecular results" for these diseases.


Through its businesses in medical devices, nutrition, diagnostics and generic drugs, Abbott generated $27.4 billion in revenue in 2017. In Q3 of this year, the company posted nearly $7.7 billion in sales.


In 2013, Abbott spun off **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), which in Q3 generated $8.2 billion in revenue.


Is Abbott Laboratories Ready To Pump Up New Breakout?
-----------------------------------------------------


Abbott has been climbing steadily higher since the end of 2016. The stock is now testing support along its 10-week line as it builds the right side of an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). One warning sign is that there have been more down weeks in heavy volume in the base than up weeks. Look for heavy volume to kick in as the stock approaches the 74.25 buy point.


On the positive side, the relative strength line has been rising into new-high ground a sign of market leadership.


Abbott gapped up to a 2.2% gain Wednesday as the general market bounced on Tuesday's election results. Abbott is now just 2% below the entry.

Adding to its existing lineup of over 45 brands, including Tinder, OKCupid and Pairs, online dating pioneer **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) has just [teamed up with Univision to launch Chispa](http://ir.mtch.com/news-releases/news-release-details/match-group-and-univision-communications-inc-launch-new-free), a new dating app for Latino singles.









 
 
 According to Match, one in three relationships now originates on a dating product. And like BlackPeopleMeet, IndiaMatch and ChinesePeopleMeet, Chispa offers a relationship-building platform for a particular community of people with similar backgrounds.
Chispa, which means spark in Spanish, is free and now available in the app stores from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


Match also has a new feature called [Little Black Book](http://mashable.com/2007/12/18/match-facebook/#5rFmRQAzuGqh) that helps fellow Match.com users find each other on **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).


Tinder Takes Off
----------------


Among Match's various brands, Tinder showed particularly strong growth in Q3, contributing to an 85% year-over-year gain in average paid member count (PMC) to 476,000.


The popular dating site allows members to view personal profiles and swipe to the right if they like what they see and to the left if they don't.


Match has also been developing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technology for Tinder and other products to enhance and personalize the user experience.


In the summer, the company offered to buy Bumble, a dating site focused on college-educated millennials. Bumble turned down the $450 million offer, but Match is reportedly still at the negotiating table discussing a potential offer in the neighborhood of $1 billion.


Mixed Signals
-------------


Earnings growth for Match has declined over the last two quarters, with margins impacted in Q3 by $11 million of Tinder payroll taxes on option exercises and some professional fees.


But revenue growth for the November 2015 IPO jumped from 12% to 19% in the third quarter, and the company continues to sport a strong return on equity (56%) and annual pretax profit margin (25%).


Match has a 92 Composite Rating, putting it in the No. 12 spot among its peers in the Internet-Content industry group.


[Leading Chinese internet stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and social media giant and [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) Facebook hold the No. 1 and No. 2 slots within the group, respectively. The group itself ranks No. 14 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Budding Breakout?
-----------------


Match is working on a second-stage flat base with a 32.97 buy point.



In a potentially bullish sign, the relative strength line is near new high ground ahead of the potential breakout. A 1.5 up/down volume ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and seven quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for the stock.


As Facebook, Apple, Autohome and other tech stocks came under pressure Tuesday, Match also pulled back, leaving it 4% below the entry at the close. Facebook was also down, but managed to close above its prior 175.59 buy point.


See if tech stocks can find support and rebound, and if Match can take a swipe at a new breakout in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

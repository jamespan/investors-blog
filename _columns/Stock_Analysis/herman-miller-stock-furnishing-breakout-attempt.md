Global furniture maker **Herman Miller** ([MLHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLHR)) is trying to furnish investors with a new breakout. Can the Michigan-based firm design a successful move past a potential 49.50 buy point?




The best stocks tend to already be leaders in their field when they surge higher, and Herman Miller has a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning it's already outperforming 97% of all stocks.


Fellow industry peers include **Knoll** ([KNL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNL)), **Leggett & Platt** ([LEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEG)), **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)), and **Kimball International** ([KBAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBAL)). The group earns a strong No. 13 rating among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

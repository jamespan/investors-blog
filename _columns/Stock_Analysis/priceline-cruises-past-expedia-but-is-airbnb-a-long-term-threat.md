After years of running commercials featuring William Shatner as “The Negotiator,” online travel giant **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) has launched a new campaign with the theme, “Whatever’s on the line, Priceline.”


Shatner continues to narrate the new spots, and Priceline continues to innovate and grow, shattering analyst estimates for Q4 earnings last month and also beating on revenue.


In December, Priceline announced it would invest an additional $500 million in **Ctrip** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)), boosting its investment in the Chinese online travel company to $1.9 billion since 2014. Ctrip helps Priceline enhance its presence in the China, the world’s largest outbound travel market.


Earlier this month, Priceline-owned Booking.com launched a new online platform that lets travelers search and discover destinations based on their passions, rather than just by location.


No. 1 Ranking Among Online Travel Peers
---------------------------------------


While the Leisure-Travel Booking industry group ranks a lowly No. 130, Priceline’s 94 Composite Rating is No. 1 among its peers, ahead of **Sabre Corporation** ([SABR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SABR)), **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and Ctrip.


Expedia says it hasn’t yet seen a material impact from alternative accommodations and sharing economy pioneer Airbnb, but to help compete in that space, it bought vacation rental site HomeAway last year.


To address the growing popularity of Airbnb, which has not yet set a timeline for its much-anticipated IPO, Priceline CEO Darren Huston said his company would continue to invest in home and vacation rentals this year.


Top Fund Managers Take Positions In Priceline
---------------------------------------------


Priceline is a member of the [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), with a $65.7 billion market cap that dwarfs Expedia’s $17.5 billion valuation.


Attracted by a 33% annual EPS growth rate, 35% return on equity and 38.8% annual pre-tax profit margin, 6 of the 20 top-performing funds in the IBD Mutual Fund Index have reported a position in Priceline, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)).


The stock currently sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating moderate to heavy buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


Nearing Breakout From First-Stage Base
--------------------------------------


[![Markup_PCLN](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Markup_PCLN-300x206.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Markup_PCLN.jpg)Since March 2014, the stock has hit resistance around the 1,400 mark. But Priceline rose over 21% for the week after reporting earnings on Feb. 17, and since then it has held on and added to those gains.


It’s now working on a first-stage double bottom with a 1342.09 buy point. Look for the stock to clear the entry on volume at least 40% above average.

From self-driving cars to cloud-based streaming services for millions of users, the key to making it all work is to "move Big Data fast." And that's where Silicon Valley-based **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) comes in.


The maker of high-speed, mixed-signal semiconductor solutions for the communications, data center and computing industries calls itself the "FedEx of digital data," comparing its interconnecting products to a fleet of trucks or drones delivering a massive, unending stream of packages.


Q2 Earnings On Tap
------------------


As tech titans like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) drive demand for cloud-based apps and always-connected, Internet of Things devices, they also drive demand for behind-the-scenes players like Inphi, which ranks No. 2 among chip designer stocks.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) holds the top spot within the No. 10-ranked group, while **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)), **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) round out the top five. Inphi, MaxLinear, Nvidia, and Broadcom are all members of the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


After a string of triple-digit gains, Inphi's earnings growth slowed to 13% in Q4. It posted a 17% rise in Q1, but sales growth continued to decline for the fourth consecutive report. Inphi releases Q2 numbers on Monday.


Later-Stage Breakout Attempt
----------------------------


After breaking out of a later-stage double bottom in mid-July and rising as much as 8% from the buy point, the stock fell back within the 33.69-35.37 buy zone.


Later-stage breakouts are more prone to failure, and it's risky to buy a stock just before it reports results. But also note that in this market, several breakouts have stalled or given back profits, only to take off again later.


On Thursday, Inphi found support at the buy point and climbed 1.3% for the day, although volume was below average. We'll see if Inphi reports well and continues to rise in heavy volume.

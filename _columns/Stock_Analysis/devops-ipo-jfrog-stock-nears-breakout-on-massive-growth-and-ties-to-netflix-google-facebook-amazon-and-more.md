When companies like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Facebook parent **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) rely on you to keep their platforms up to date, you must be doing something right — and essential. Each of these tech titans and more turn to DevOps leader **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)) to build, manage, and distribute elements of their mission-critical software.

DevOps Leader JFrog Keeps Google, Facebook, Netflix And More Up To Date
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Headquartered in the heart of Silicon Valley, JFrog plays an integral role in DevOps — development and operations — for tech powerhouses ranging from [Facebook](https://www.investors.com/news/meta-stock-a-buy-after-run-why-there-may-be-more-upside/), [Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) and [Netflix](https://www.investors.com/research/netflix-stock-buy-now/) to **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and Amazon through Amazon Web Services (AWS).


The JFrog Software Supply Chain Platform is driven by the concept of "[Liquid Software](https://jfrog.com/whitepaper/a-vision-of-liquid-software/)." To handle the massive scale of systems and apps for firms like Netflix, Facebook and Google, the software aims to be liquid in that products and services get connected to "software pipes" that constantly stream updates into JFrog's systems and devices. Liquid software means continuously and automatically updating systems with no human intervention.


JFrog offers integrated security features to help identify, protect, and remediate against threats and vulnerabilities. Its hybrid, universal, multicloud platform is available as both self-hosted and SaaS services across major cloud service providers. The company works with millions of users and more than 7,000 customers worldwide, including a majority of the Fortune 100.


JFrog Sparks 500% Growth — With More On The Way
-----------------------------------------------


In Q1, JFrog kicked off the new year with 6 cents per share in earnings, a 500% year-over-year gain. Boosted by clients like Google, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and more, Wall Street sees the DevOps leader posting a 354% EPS gain in Q2, leading to a 417% rise for the full year.


Sales growth averaged 37% a year for the last three years. The company generated $79.8 million in Q1 sales, a gain of 25% over the prior-year quarter.


In [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-jfrog-frog.aspx), JFrog stock earns the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?). Industry peers **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and **ModelN** ([MODN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MODN)) share that honor.


Further showcasing demand for JFrog, the DevOps firm sports an A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a strong 1.5 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


JFrog Stock Looks To Leap Into Buy Zone
---------------------------------------


Earlier this year, JFrog [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in its prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/). That makes its current consolidation a first-stage pattern, giving it a higher likelihood of success compared with later-stage setups.


By completing a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), the stock has established the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 27.85. As you like to see, downside volume has been below average as it crafts the handle.


In another sign of rebounding technical strength, the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) has climbed back above the longer-term 200-day line. Last month, the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) soared above the 50-day benchmark.


On Wednesday, JFrog stock showed resilience by rising in the final hour of trading to close near the top of the day's price range. On Friday, the stock again showed resilience, bouncing off the day's lows to close near top of its price rage.


With strong institutional demand and the support of tech titans like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, the DevOps innovator could be developing a sustained new run.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause widespread health issues and hinders attempts to end economic shutdowns, **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) is in a buy zone, trying to strengthen its recent breakout.




The Long Beach, Calif.-based Fortune 500 health care giant posted a big spike in earnings growth in Q2. Molina reported a 62% EPS increase after showing two quarters of declines. After severalÂ  quarters of revenue decreases, the provider of managed health care services has generated two straight quarters of 10% sales growth.


Together with **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)), Molina shares top billing in the managed health care group. With a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Molina and Humana are outpacing 94% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Molina Healthcare Expects To Revive EPS Growth In 2021
------------------------------------------------------


Analysts see Molina Healthcare posting a 3% earnings increase for 2020, followed by a 14% jump next year. While such numbers don't earn Molina a spot among the [fastest-growing stocks for 2020](https://www.investors.com/research/fastest-growing-companies-2020-despite-coronavirus/) like **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and **Quidel** ([QDEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QDEL)), Molina has generated average annual EPS growth of 68% over the last three years.


Over the last eight quarters, Molina has reported revenue ranging from $4.2 billion to $4.7 billion. It served approximately 3.6 million members as of June 30.


Showing its efficiency, Molina sported a strong 41.2% return on equity last year. Molina's ROE trumped those of industry peers Humana (21.7%) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) (26.7%).


But Molina lags Humana and UnitedHealth in terms of its [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE as a whole. Molina earns a B SMR Rating, while Humana and UnitedHealth both have a grade of A.


Molina currently sports an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and showed a solid rise in fund ownership last quarter, from 715 to 924 funds.


Breakout Watch: Molina Stock Tests New Buy Zone
-----------------------------------------------


Molina Healthcare initially cleared a 186.38 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) on July 15 but immediately ran into resistance. The stock managed to find support and bounce back, becoming slightly extended by Aug. 7. Molina then retreated, but found support right around its initial buy point.


The stock has returned to the buy zone to show good resilience. The stock came off its lows Friday, closing at 193.85, 4% above the initial buy point.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has been moving sideways in recent weeks, so look for it to trend upward and reach a new 52-week high. It's been ticking slightly higher to close the week.


The buy range for Molina Healthcare extends to 195.70.

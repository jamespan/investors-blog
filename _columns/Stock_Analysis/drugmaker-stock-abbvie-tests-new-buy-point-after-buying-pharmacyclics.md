Medical stocks have been among the market's top performers this year, and drugmaker **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)) is trying to add to the sector's gains.

  

The Chicago-based firm is a leader within the Ethical Drugs industry group, which also includes **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) and **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)).

  

To establish a leadership position in the rapidly growth hematological oncology market, AbbVie recently bought blood cancer drug firm Pharmacyclics.

  

The acquisition will add to AbbVie's existing line of pharmaceutical and biologic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

AbbVie already generates around $20 billion in annual revenue but was still able to post a double-digit increase in first-quarter sales. Q1 earnings growth accelerated from 9% to 32%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 28%, followed by a 17% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

The company pays a dividend with a current yield of 3% and sports a stellar 172% return on equity.

  

Overall, AbbVie earns a 95 Composite Rating and has shown signs of institutional demand, including a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

AbbVie went public in 2013, when it was spun off from **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)). Although it's hit some bumps along the way, AbbVie stock has climbed steadily higher.

  

It started forming a 24-week cup-with-handle base last December. As the handle formed, volume lightened up â€” a positive sign that shows large investors not selling aggressively.

  

On Tuesday, AbbVie tried to punch through its 66.76 buy point but closed below it. Then on Wednesday, it broke out again, this time closing above the buy point. Volume was 270% above average.

  

The buying range on a breakout is up to 5% above the buy point. For AbbVie, that's from 66.76 to 70.10.

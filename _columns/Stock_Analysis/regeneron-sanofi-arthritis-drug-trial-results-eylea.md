After bouncing back from the biotech sell-off that followed Hillary Clinton's accusations of Big Pharma price gouging, **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) now faces a new test: resistance at its latest buy point.


The maker of Eylea eye injections has been floating in and out of a 557.97 to 585.87 buying range since Oct. 27.


One catalyst that could push the stock higher is positive phase-three study results for sarilumab, a human antibody to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Regeneron is developing the treatment with partner **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)).


Regeneron also recently announced European Union approval for use of Eylea for treatment of visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV).


**Key Numbers**


Regeneron's 98 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 spot in the biotech industry group, which ranked No. 54 in Friday's edition.


Fellow biotechs **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) (87 Composite, No. 7 ranking) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) (81 Composite, No. 13) are still in recovery mode.


Regeneron's Q3 earnings growth spiked from 17% to 38% and topped estimates. Sales growth also accelerated, from 50% to 57%.


The company raised its outlook, but expense guidance also rose and [sales of its Praluent cholesterol drug disappointed](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/110915-779911-top-biotech-in-buy-range.htm).


**Chart Analysis**


Regeneron cleared the 557.97 entry in a first-stage [double bottom](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/netflix-double-bottom-breakout-ibd-investing-show-excerpt/) on Oct. 27, but volume was 6% below average.


When Regeneron reported Q3 earnings Nov. 4, it temporarily shot higher, but reversed to close in the bottom half of the price range.


It's not unusual for a stock to return to the buy point after breaking out. Regeneron has generally found support right around the entry price, but see if can continue to hold its ground and move higher in heavier volume.

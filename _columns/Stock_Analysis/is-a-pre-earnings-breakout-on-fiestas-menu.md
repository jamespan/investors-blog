With Q4 earnings expected Feb. 19, **Fiesta Restaurant Group** ([FRGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRGI)) is testing a new buy point.

  

The Texas-based company operates some 160 Taco Cabana and 100 Pollo Tropical casual restaurants. Fiesta is tied with **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) for the No. 4 ranking within the Retail-Restaurants industry group, which holds the No. 5 spot among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

For more insight into the company, check out the Jan. 10 IBD Radio Show interview with fund manager and IBD Meetup organizer Shakeel Dewji and [download his presentation on Fiesta](http://news.investors.com/011015-734189-january-10-2015-how-to-make-money-in-stocks-radio-show.htm#strategies) and its expansion plan.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Fiesta has posted four straight quarters of strong earnings growth, ranging from 62% to 67%. Sales growth has been slower, but just as steady, coming in between 8% and 10%. For 2014, analysts expect earnings to rise 56%, followed by a 20% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Fiesta sports a solid 23% return on equity, a 29% three-year annual EPS growth rate and a strong Group RS Rating of 98. All that gives the stock a 98 Composite Rating, and its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last three months.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Fiesta has made a five-fold run since its 2012 IPO. Last October, it broke out of a long consolidation that showed signs of institutional accumulation in the right side of the base.

  

The stock is now working on a new flat base with a 64.28 buy point. Within that pattern, Fiesta flashed several weeks of tight closes right along its 10-week moving average, a sign of healthy support.

  

Earlier this week, the stock posted three straight up days in above-average volume, including Wednesday, when it climbed just below the buy point before pulling back.

  

See if the stock can punch past the buy point in volume at least 40% to 50% above average, and keep an eye out for Fiesta's fourth-quarter numbers when it reports on Feb. 19.

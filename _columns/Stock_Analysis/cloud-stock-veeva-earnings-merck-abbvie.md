Breakout Cloud Stock
--------------------


Veeva Systems gapped up to a 12% gain on Feb. 28 after reporting earnings for its fiscal 2018 Q4, ended Jan. 31.


The stock continued to climb for several days, then pulled back to form its current later-stage double bottom. On Wednesday, the stock jump more than 3% to 76.16, clearing the 75.67 entry. Volume was on the rise, but still below average.


Veeva has continued to edge higher, closing the week 3% above the entry and still within the buy range, which extends to 79.45. The relative strength line is just shy of a new high.


Keep in mind that Veeva, which is on the [IBD Leaderboard watch list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist), is set to report earnings for fiscal 2019 Q1 (ended April 30) on May 24 after the market close. Analysts are looking for a 40% rise in earnings per share.

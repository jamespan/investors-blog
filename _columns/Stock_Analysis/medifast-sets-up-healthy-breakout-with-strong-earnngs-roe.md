Already on IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buying-tech-stocks-including-amazon-zoom-nvidia-microsoft-alibaba-facebook/), wellness community builder **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)) is trying to forge a healthy breakout. After gapping up at the open Friday, Medifast eased to close 4% shy of a 183.64 buy point.




Through its [Optavia Community](https://medifastinc.com/optavia/) of health and lifestyle coaches, Medifast aims to help members start living the lives they want "One Healthy Habit at a Time." Medifast takes a holistic approach to wellness, combining "scientifically proven plans (and) products and the ongoing support of Coaches who help their Clients learn The Habits of Health."


It's been a healthy business model for Medifast. The Baltimore, Md.-based company has posted average annual EPS growth of 56% over the past three years. Analysts see Medifast growing earnings 80% in Q3 and 47% for the full year. With no significant debt, Medifast had a stellar [return on equity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/return-on-equity-can-help-find-winning-growth-stocks/) of 68% for 2019.


Medifast also pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.5% on an annualized basis.


As indicated by a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Medifast stock is outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the key [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Can Medifast Break Out After Healthy 274% Rebound?
--------------------------------------------------


After hitting new lows during the coronavirus crash in March, Medifast bounced back with a vengeance. The stock shot up 274% until pulling back from a new all-time high in early August. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) soared during that run, proving that Medifast was outperforming the S&P 500.


No stocks go straight up forever. Medifast ran into resistance in August and began forming a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). It's been a healthy, controlled pullback â€” an opportunity for Medifast to digest its recent gains. The retreat was mild, and the stock has found good support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


On Wednesday, Medifast continued to bounce off that benchmark line, rising just under 7% to close 5% below the 183.64 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock added to those gains Thursday, and closed over 10% higher for the week. Volume for the week is below average, so look for heavier trade to kick in on any attempted breakout.

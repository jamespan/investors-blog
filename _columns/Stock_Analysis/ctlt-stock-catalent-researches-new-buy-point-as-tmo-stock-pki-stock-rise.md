After already gaining as much as 523% since its 2014 IPO, biologics and life sciences innovator **Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)) is developing a new breakout. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) for CTLT stock has soared to a new 52-week high.




Joining fellow medical sector stocks **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) and **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-in-these-tech-stocks-to-watch-ipo-stocks/), CTLT stock has seen strong [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


In addition to a solid B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), 77 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Catalent. Plus, the company has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership and IBD Mutual Fund Index member Franklin Growth (FKGRX) has a position in CTLT stock.


Catalent has earned a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), while Repligen is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).


Catalent Delivers Three Quarters Of Accelerating Growth
-------------------------------------------------------


With a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), CTLT stock is ranked No. 2 among medical research stocks, just behind **Fulgent Genetics** ([FLGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLGT)).


Catalent's rating means it's outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/), tying **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) and **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)). **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) is also an industry leader.


With over 85 years serving the industry, Catalent provides advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing solutions for drugs, biologics, cell and gene therapies, and consumer health products. The New Jersey-based company employs 15,000 people, including approximately 2,400 scientists and technicians, at more than 45 facilities.


In recent quarters, Catalent has seen earnings growth accelerate, jumping 65% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Sales growth has ranged from 16% to 31% over the past five quarters.


Analysts see EPS rising 22% when Catalent on Feb. 2 reports earnings for fiscal 2021 Q2, ended Dec. 31.


CTLT Stock Rockets Toward Buy Zone
----------------------------------


Since bottoming out in March during the pandemic, CTLT stock has rocketed higher. Along the way, Catalent has found consistent support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


It pulled back sharply in rising volume on Nov. 9, but quickly recovered to its former highs while forming a [cup-shape base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


TMO stock and PKI stock are also testing new buy zones, while CRL stock is already extended from its recent breakout.


CTLT stock is now just below a 120.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) with earnings due early next month. Look for Catalent to break past that entry in volume at least 40% above average.

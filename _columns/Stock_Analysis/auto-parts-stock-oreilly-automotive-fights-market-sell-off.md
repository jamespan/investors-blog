O'Reilly's Accelerating Earnings Growth
---------------------------------------


O'Reilly Automotive has posted three quarters of accelerating EPS growth, including a jump from 28% to 41% in Q2. Analysts are looking for a 33% rise when the company reports [Q3 earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-analyst-estimates-eps-growth/) on Oct. 24.


Revenue growth has been slow, but steady, ranging from 3% to 8% over the last eight quarters. Sales gains have edged higher in each of the last two quarters, coming in at 7% in the latest report.


Signs of institutional demand for shares in O'Reilly included a 1.4 up/down volume ratio and four quarters of rising fund ownership. After dipping last week, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating edged back up to a B-.


O'Reilly Automotive Testing Its Brakes
--------------------------------------


Before Wednesday's big stock market sell-off, O'Reilly Automotive had been trading in a tight range. But that changed as the Nasdaq fell 4% and sliced through its 200-day line Wednesday.


O'Reilly skidded 2.6% in above-average and rising volume, leaving it just above its 50-day moving average. On Thursday, the stock tried to rise, but closed the session down 1.8% and below the benchmark line. Volume was again above average.


On Friday, the operator of over 5,000 auto parts stores bounced back to a nearly 3% gain in volume higher than on both of the prior two down days. The week's close marked the completion of the stock's newÂ [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), which takes five weeks to form.


On Monday, O'Reilly Automotive rose another 1.2%, bringing the stock to within 2% of the 351.75 buy point as its relative strength line hits a new 52-week high.


But note that it's best to avoid making new buys during a market correction. It's less risky if you wait for a new market uptrend to begin before investing.



Viewed on a weekly chart, AutoZone continues to trade in a tight range, a sign of resilience in the face of the current stock market decline. It rose 1.6% Monday and remains above its 10-week moving average.


On Wednesday, Advance Auto Parts showed action similar to O'Reilly Automotive. It fell 3.4% in rising volume, but managed to stay above its 50-day line. The similarity continued Thursday, as Advance Auto Parts closed below its 50-day line in above-average and rising volume. The stock closed the week with a 2.5% gain Friday as it bounced off its 50-day moving average. Advance Auto Parts kicked off the new week with a gain of over 1%.

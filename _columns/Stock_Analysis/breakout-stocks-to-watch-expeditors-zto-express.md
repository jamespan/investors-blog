Cloud-Based Collaboration With Walmart
--------------------------------------


In March, Expeditors announced [Expeditors Carrier Allocation](https://investor.expeditors.com/press-releases/2018/03-05-2018-133139723), a cloud-based collaboration platform that was pioneered with [retail giant](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). According to the company, the new forecasting and planning platform "connects shippers and forwarders with ocean carriers in advance of shipping to determine the most optimal flow of products."


Expeditors has posted three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, rising from a 5% decline in the second quarter of 2017 to a 51% increase in Q1 of this year. Analysts are looking for a 30% rise when the company reports Q2 numbers. Expeditors has also delivered six quarters of rising revenue growth.


Mutual fund managers have shown an interest in both Expeditors, which made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-unitedhealth-texas-instruments-united-airlines-expeditors/). The stock sports a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.3 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


ZTO has posted four quarters of increasing fund ownership and has a 1.1 up/down volume ratio. But its D Accumulation/Distribution Rating is below the C or higher score you look for.


With a 96 Composite Rating, Expeditors holds the No. 1 ranking among transportation and logistics stocks. ZTO Express comes in second with a 95.


Potential Breakout Stocks To Watch
----------------------------------


Expeditors is among the potential [breakout stocks to watch ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/). While ZTO Express in on tap to report Aug. 8, it still needs time to establish a possible [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Expeditors flew past a 67.73 buy point on May 8 after reporting another quarter of accelerating earnings growth. The stock continued to climb until pulling back a month later to form its current cup-shaped base. Within that pattern, the stock has shown tight trading and consistent [support at its 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). Its relative strength line is rising buy still shy of a new high as Expeditors closes in on the 78.26 entry.


On Friday, the stock closed fractionally lower at 76.57, ending the week 2% below the buy point.



ZTO Express jumped past a 21.80 buy point on July 16 in strong volume. But the stock reversed the next day, and has since fallen below its 50-day moving average. It also fell more than 7% below the entry, invalidating that buy point. The stock fell another 1.3% Friday to 19.39 in rising, but below-average volume. See if ZTO Express can bounce back from its recent retreat and form a new base.

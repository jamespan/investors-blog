J**azz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), which develops treatments in the areas of narcolepsy, oncology, pain and psychiatry, topped Q4 earnings after the close Tuesday and broke out Wednesday. That came on the heels of a [big move by fellow drugmaker](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/022315-740464-leading-pharmaceutical-firms-merge.htm) **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), which said it would buy **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)).  

  

In December, Jazz got FDA approval for the intravenous use of a drug to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. But this week, the Ireland-based firm announced it will voluntarily suspend patient enrollment in a phase two leukemia drug trial due to negative reactions in some patients.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Jazz's Q4 earnings accelerated from 31% to 42% and sales also moved higher, from 32% to 39%. But the company's outlook for 2015 was below estimates.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 17%, followed by a 22% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised lower.

  

Jazz has a stellar 40% return on equity, a 66% three-year annual EPS growth rate and overall scores a 98 Composite Rating. That earns it the No. 49 spot on the [IBD 50](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-the-50.htm).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a big move in 2013 through early 2014, Jazz hit a rough patch almost exactly one year ago. Over the next 12 months, it hit resistance just under the 180 mark multiple times.

  

Since December, the stock has been working on a cup with handle with a 177.11 buy point, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

Jazz broke out on Wednesday following several nice up days in the right side of the base. Volume was above average and rising as the stock neared the buy point and spiked on the day of the breakout, coming in 200% above average.

  

The buying range is up to 5% above the ideal buy point. For Jazz Pharmaceuticals, that's from 177.11 to 185.97.

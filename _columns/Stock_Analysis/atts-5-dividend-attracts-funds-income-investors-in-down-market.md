With a track record of stable earnings growth and a high-yielding dividend, **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) is the type of big cap stock that mutual fund managers seek out in a down market. So as fears of a new bear cycle have increased, so has demand for shares in the telecom giant.


Big Cap Leader And S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat
----------------------------------------------


The Dallas-based company pays a dividend currently yielding 5.2%, topping the 4.4% payout of rival **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)).


As noted in [The Income Investor](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/the-income-investor/top-dividend-stocks-att-verizon-near-buy-points/), having boosted its yield for 31 straight years, AT&T is an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, a title reserved for companies that have increased their dividend every year for at least the past 25 years.


From 2009 through 2015, earnings-per-share growth came in between 2.08 and 2.69. That earns AT&T an Earnings Stability factor of 2, putting it in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of stable EPS growth.

On Jan. 26, the company reported Q4 earnings that met analyst expectations for earnings, but missed on revenue as it continues to face increasing competition for lucrative postpaid phone customers from **T-Mobile** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) and **Sprint** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)).


The titan of telecom, which closed its purchase of DirecTV last July, currently ranks No. 2 on the [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), just behind Verizon.


Will AT&T Launch Long Distance Breakout?
----------------------------------------


AT&T’s stock has been bouncing around within a roughly 33 to 39 per share range since mid-2012.


While forming its current pattern, it [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/) when a new low undercut the low in its prior consolidation.

The stock showed three healthy technical indicators while forming the right side of that base. The 10-week line got back above the 40-week moving average. The Relative Strength line was soaring sharply higher. And several up weeks in heavy volume showed buying by institutional investors.


On Feb. 3, the stock cleared a 36.55 buy point, then added to those gains on Friday and Monday, ending yesterday within the 36.55 – 38.38 buy zone. Before and after the breakout, volume came in well above average, confirming demand for the stock. But on Tuesday, the stock pulled back to test the buy point.


As an established, mega-cap stock, AT&T isn’t likely to make the kind of gains you’ll find in a younger growth name during a strong bull market. But with the market in a correction, its high-yield dividend, earnings stability and healthy chart action could make it attractive to income investors.

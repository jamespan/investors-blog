Social media giant **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and self-driving car technology provider **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) might seem to have little in common with private mortgage insurance firm **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)). But all three stocks share two traits of interest to investors.
First, all three stocks made IBD's list of [today's fastest growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/).


The list, which requires a 90 or higher [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) to make the cut, focuses on a company's five-year earnings-per-share growth rate.


Mobileye has posted annual earnings growth of 117%, topping Essent (67%) and Facebook (56%).


The second trait these three market leaders share is they're all forming bases and nearing or in potential buy zones ahead of Q4 earnings.


On Wednesday, Facebook moved further above a 129.37 entry in below average, but rising volume. Mobileye still has more work to do on a base currently showing a 51.25 buy point. The stock may form a handle to offer an earlier entry.


Facebook reports earnings on Feb. 1, while Mobileye is set to reveal its latest numbers on Feb. 22.


Essent, which reports Feb. 10, rose over 1% Tuesday in below-average, but rising volume.


On Wednesday, the stock climbed over 2% in volume 107% higher than normal as it cleared a 34.04 buy point. Essent is still trading within the buy zone that extends to 35.74. Its Relative Strength line also moved into new high ground, which is a bullish sign on a breakout.



Marvelous Margins And Institutional Demand
------------------------------------------


While Facebook and Mobileye are both highly-rated stocks, Essent boasts two things the others don't share.


First, it's been a longtime member of IBD's most stringent [Sector Leaders screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), boosted by its highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and a 64.6% annual pretax profit margin, topping even the stellar margins of Facebook (55.6%) and Mobileye (51.8%).


Second, only Essent made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/new-buys-of-top-stock-funds-burlington-dave-busters-find-support/), with 16 funds investing nearly $10 million in the Bermuda-based company in the fourth quarter.


But Essent, Facebook and Mobileye all face the same test when they face their next earnings reports and see if they can launched sustained new climbs from their bases.

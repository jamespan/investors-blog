**Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) has grown well beyond its roots as a search engine. But while it's now involved in everything from productivity software and the Android operating system to Chromebook laptops and even driverless cars, it remains primarily an ad-selling machine, with over 90% of revenue coming from ad sales.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Google generated $16 billion in sales last quarter, marking a year-over-year increase of 22%. It was the best top-line increase in five quarters and the fourth straight quarter of sales growth acceleration.

  

Earnings growth also accelerated, from 4% to 23%.

  

The company has a 19% return on equity and a solid 96 Composite Rating.

  

On the downside, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a D+. See if that improves to at least a C or better.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After struggling to clear the $315-$325 area for nearly three years, Google launched a new upward climb in January 2013.

  

It moved higher in tight, healthy trading, forming several short consolidations as part of a longer, first-stage base-on-base.

  

Google broke out again in October on Q3 earnings, gapping up nearly 14% in volume 516% above average.

  

The stock then moved steadily higher in tight trading for almost five months.

  

In late February, Google pulled back to form its current base, a second-stage cup-with-handle with a 609.01 buy point.

  

On Wednesday, Google slipped below its 50-day moving average. The stock closed below that line on Friday.

  

Volume was below average last week, but see how Google behaves as it tries to get back above the 50-day and complete its base.

Rebounding from three quarters of slumping earnings growth, **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) posted a 1,000% EPS gain in Q2. Analysts expect a 700% increase in Q3. The maker of the Omnipod Insulin Management System is testing a new buy point and all-time high.




The Omnipod Insulin Management System offers an alternative to traditional insulin delivery methods. The wearable device eliminates the need to use a needle, providing up to three days of nonstop insulin delivery.


Insulet also tailors the Omnipod technology platform for the delivery of non-insulin subcutaneous (i.e., under the skin) drugs across other therapeutic areas.

169 A+ Funds Own Shares In Omnipod Maker Insulet
------------------------------------------------


While Insulet did not make IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buying-tech-stocks-including-amazon-zoom-nvidia-microsoft-alibaba-facebook/), 169 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in the stock.


Plus, Insulet has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership. The stock's B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/) further confirm [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


In addition to strong earnings growth last quarter and strong estimates for Q3, Insulet has generated average annual sales growth of 26% over the past three years. One red flag, however, is the Massachusetts-based company's 1,170% debt-to-equity ratio.


Consensus analyst estimates remain strong. Analysts expect 89% earnings growth for 2020, followed by a 242% increase in 2021.


Can Omnipod Maker Deliver New Breakout, All-Time High?
------------------------------------------------------


As the stock market runs into resistance and tries to regain its footing, Insulet is trying to complete a new base showing a 234.09 entry.


It's best to avoid making any new buys during a market correction, but the stock market trend can turn quickly. Keep updating your watchlist as you wait to see how stocks like Insulet handle this test.


Insulet successfully tested its 21-day moving average Friday and is well above its longer-term 50-day line. To close the week, the stock gained over 3%, but in light volume. Insulet is now 4% below its buy point.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has eased back, but remains healthy and within striking distance of a 52-week high.


See if the stock market can rebound quickly from the current correction, and Insulet can break out and reclaim its old price high.

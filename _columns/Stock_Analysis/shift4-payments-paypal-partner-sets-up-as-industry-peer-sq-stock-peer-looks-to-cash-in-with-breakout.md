Just behind Square parent **Block** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) among the leaders in the payment processors group, **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) generated 240% earnings growth last quarter. With Q2 earnings due early next month, the **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) partner has climbed above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) as investors look for it to pay off with a new breakout.




SQ stock was recently featured on the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/sq-stock-looks-to-squash-summertime-blues-with-bnpl-afterpay-and-fresh-breakout/) as it sets up a new entry of its own. Block and Shift4 both report on Aug. 3. PayPal reports the day before.


Shift4's mission is to redefine commerce by simplifying complex payments ecosystems worldwide. The 2020 IPO powers billions of transactions annually for hundreds of thousands of businesses in virtually every industry. From Food & Beverage and Travel & Hospitality to Retail and Crypto, Shift4 empowers clients to accept payments everywhere with its end-to-end commerce solutions.


The company processes over $200 billion in payments annually and has more than 200,000 customers.


Shift4 has partnered with PayPal through its Shift4Shop platform. The partnership allows clients to add a PayPal shopping cart to their websites, further simplifying the payment process for retailers and other businesses who want to generate revenue and complete transactions wherever and whenever it's most convenient for all involved.


Shift4 Showcases Impressive Growth
----------------------------------


Last quarter, Shift4 generated earnings per share of 51 cents â€” a 240% year-over-year increase. That came on top of a 488% EPS increase in Q4 of last year.


When the company reports next month, analysts forecast a 59% gain. Wall Street expects full-year EPS growth of 61%, followed by a 33% gain in 2024.


While payment processors SQ stock, PayPal and Shift4 did not make this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/tesla-stock-revs-up-demand-alongside-msft-stock-axon-oracle-and-more/), leading money managers have demonstrated demand Shift4. Thirty-one funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD have reported a position in FOUR stock. Plus, the number of funds owning shares has jumped from 385 in Q3 of last year to 528 now, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) data.


Shift4 generated $547 million in revenue in Q1, a 36% gain over the prior-year quarter. Over the last three years, the company has delivered average annual sales growth of 50%.


FOUR Stock Finding Support For Continued Climb
----------------------------------------------


After running into resistance at the end of March, Shift4 fell below its 10-week line in heavy volume. But FOUR stock has since reclaimed that key benchmark. The 10-week line, which remains solidly above its 40-week cousin, has also begun to curve higher, a sign of rebounding technical strength.


Despite recent volatility, note how Shift4 has found support multiple times at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It managed to find support at that line again Friday. Recently. the stock has also flashed multiple up days on above-average volume. However, some have reversed to close the day up but toward the bottom of the price range. Such action points to some hesitation among investors as the company gets ready to release Q2 numbers.


Look for Shift4 to shift into high gear with a strong report and give its struggling [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) a boost.


As Shift4 and SQ stock set up, PYPL stock continues to work through an extended slump.

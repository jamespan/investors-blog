Featured in [The New America](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/sgh-stock-business-resructuring-fuels-growth/) earlier this month, IoT and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Smart Global Holdings** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) continues to transform its business. Rebranding itself in October to identify as SGH, the data storage industry leader has posted three quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth.




SGH tried to engineer a jump on Friday but reversed course to end the day with a loss as the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) sold off,


Started over 30 years ago, the company has a global footprint through operations in North and South America, Europe and Asia, including China, Japan and India. With its acquisition of Cree LED, SGH now has three core business segments: Memory Solutions (the company's largest), Intelligent Platform Solutions, and LED Solutions.


Within Memory Solutions, SGH drives [SMART Modular Technologies](https://www.smartm.com/) and [SMART Supply Chain Logistics](http://www.smartsscs.com/SCS/). SGH works across a range of industries and sectors, including the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive and other transportation segments, data storage and aerospace.


The Intelligent Platform Solutions includes [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) and high-speed computing leader [Penguin Computing](https://www.penguincomputing.com/). Intelligent Platform Solutions also has its hands in 5G and wireless networks via [SMART Embedded Computing](https://smartembedded.com/) and [SMART Wireless Computing](https://www.inforcecomputing.com/).


Smart Technology, IoT Drive Accelerating Earnings And Sales Growth
------------------------------------------------------------------


Year-over-year sales growth for SGH has accelerated from 7% in the quarter ended in November 2020 to gains of 12%, 56% and 57% in the past three quarters.


In October, the company reported results for its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021. For the August-ended quarter, earnings rose 163% to $2.16 a share. For the current quarter, analysts expect SGH to generate 156% EPS growth.


In [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-smart-global-holdings-sgh.aspx), SGH earns strong ratings for each of its Supply And Demand metrics. The company earned a spot on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-billions-aapl-nvda-msft-googl-crm/).


SGH Tests Buy Zone
------------------


After breaking out in April, SGH ran into resistance later that month. It has gone on to form two [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), rising to test new highs and retreating to test its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


After slumping off old highs since April, SGH's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) reversed higher, showing market outperformance.


The stock punched through a 58.49 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on Nov. 5 but has failed to gain traction. Part of that has been due to [selling pressure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-in-stocks-start-with-stock-market-investing-routine-routine/) and [volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/) in the stock market indexes.


At first, SGH showed resilience, managing to keep trading right around the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). After an early spike on Friday, the stock reversed to close below the buy point it had cleared on Nov. 5.


See if the general market can regroup and if SGH can tap into I0T, 5G and other major trends and design a sustained climb.

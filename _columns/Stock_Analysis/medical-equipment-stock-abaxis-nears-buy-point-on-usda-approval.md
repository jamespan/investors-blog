After reporting accelerating earnings and sales growth last quarter and getting USDA approval for its VetScan Anaplasma Rapid Test Kit earlier this month, medical equipment maker **Abaxis** ([ABAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABAX)) is trying put the finishing touches on a second-stage [flat base](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656343-getting-started-chart-patterns-flat-base.aspx).

  

The California-based firm provides point-of-care blood analyzers to the medical and veterinary markets. Its newly-approved VetScan kit will allow Abaxis to offer a comprehensive solution for the assessment of tick-borne diseases.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After a slowdown in 2013 and 2014, Abaxis' earnings and sales growth has been on the rebound. The company reported Q3 numbers for fiscal 2015 on Jan. 29, beating estimates for both the top and bottom lines. Earnings growth jumped to 86%, while sales accelerated to 46%.

  

Abaxis is scheduled to report Q4 numbers on Apr. 22. For the full fiscal year, analysts are looking for earnings to grow 56%, followed by a 30% rise in fiscal 2016.

  

Although its 8% return on equity is light and its 8% annual EPS growth rate is below the 25%-50% pace that is preferable, the recent rebound in Abaxis' quarterly growth has helped it land a solid 97 Composite Rating.

  

Its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate institutional buying over the last 13 weeks, and its 1.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio also points to demand. Plus, the number of funds with a position in the stock has risen nicely over the last two quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The weekly stock chart reflects the rebound in the company's fundamentals.

  

When sales and earnings slumped in 2013, the stock sold off and began forming a 59-week consolidation. On the positive side, the low in that base undercut the low in the prior pattern. That [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx), meaning the new pattern was a first-stage [cup-with-handle](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656339-getting-started-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle.aspx).

  

As Abaxis showed signs of a turnaround, its stock also bounced back. It broke out in early September, and although it stumbled a bit in October, the stock has continued on an upward trend.

  

Abaxis is now working on a second-stage flat base with a 66.15 buy point, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

On Jan. 30, the day after reporting earnings, Abaxis bolted higher, but reversed to close toward the bottom of the price range. It headed lower for the next few days but found support at the 50-day line.

  

Since then, the stock has climbed right along the 10-day moving average as it continues to build the right side of the base. That type of trading around the longer- and shorter-term moving average lines is a healthy sign of institutional support.

  

The stock tested the 10-day again on Wednesday, so see if it can maintain that support and break past the 66.15 buy point on heavy volume.

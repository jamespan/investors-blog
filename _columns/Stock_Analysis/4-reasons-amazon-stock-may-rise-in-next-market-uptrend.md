With its streaming video service, one-hour delivery, a fast-growing cloud business and earnings that crushed estimates last quarter, **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) could be primed to move higher when a stronger stock market returns.

  

Along with rival **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), Amazon was an early leader in the streaming market and a pioneer in developing original content like "Bosch" and "Sneaky Pete" to compete with Netflix shows such as "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black."

  

This week, CEO Jeff Bezos also announced that Amazon Prime members can now do something Netflix members can't: download movies and TV shows for offline viewing on a smartphone or tablet.

  

The online retail giant has also been rolling out 1-hour and 2-hour delivery services in selected cities around the country.

  

Also, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business, which competes with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and other tech giants, generated $1.82 billion in revenue in Q2 for a year-over-year gain of 81%.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

All these moves could make Amazon a comeback stock ready to lead in the next uptrend.

  

The online retail giant posted triple-digit earnings growth in Q2 and revenue gains accelerated from 15% to 20%.

  

Although still below what you should look for, Amazon's Composite Rating of 88 has been rising. And the number of funds with a position in the stock has risen over the last two quarters, jumping from 2,378 to 2,460 in Q2.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After spending 2014 in a long, choppy consolidation, Amazon jumped higher in January. It then showed several weeks of tight trading before spiking again in April on Q1 earnings.

  

It held the bulk of those gains as it again showed tight trading with good support along the 10-week line.

  

The stock broke out of a flat base in July, just ahead of its heavily-promoted Amazon Prime Day, where Prime members got exclusive discounts said to rival traditional Black Friday savings.

  

After rising as much as 28%, the stock pulled back with the rest of the market.

  

Like the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and several leading stocks, Amazon showed flash crash-type action on Aug. 24, so-called Black Monday. But it rebounded to close the week above the 10-week line and at the top of its price range.

  

Volume for that week was heavy, 55% above average â€” an indication that large investors were stepping in to support the stock and protect their positions.

  

Amazon has flashed similar spikes in trading at key times over the last several months. All of that points to strong institutional demand for the stock.

  

So see if Amazon goes on to form a new base and breaks out on good volume when a new market uptrend begins.

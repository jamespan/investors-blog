Ohio-based **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) rounds out the top five stocks among discount retailers, behind **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)). The group ranks No. 47 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


While Five Below, Dollar Tree and Dollar General have all broken out recently, Big Lots and Ollie's are still working on new bases.


Earnings Beat With Blemishes
----------------------------


Big Lots operates 1,447 locations in 47 states, offering brand-name merchandise at prices that are, according the company, up to 70% lower than traditional retailers and 20% to 40% below most discount stores.


On the downside, Big Lots' earnings and sales growth have also generally come in lower than its rival retailers, as the table below shows.


But the company has posted two consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including an estimate-beating 34% gain for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, ended April 30. Big Lots is expected to report Q2 numbers next month.


Analysts expect EPS to rise 15% this fiscal year, followed by a 12% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Company** | **3-Year Annual EPS Growth** | **3-Year Annual Sales Growth** | **Last Quarter's EPS Growth** |
| Ollie's Bargain Outlet ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) | 59% | 19% | 82% |
| Five Below ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) | 27% | 25% | 50% |
| Dollar General ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) | 11% | 8% | 23% |
| Big Lots ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) | 1% | -1% | 34% |
| Dollar Tree ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) | -2% | 29% | 25% |


Support Vs. Resistance
----------------------


After beating estimates for fiscal Q1, Big Lots spiked nearly 17% on volume 180% above average during the week ended May 27, pushing it above a cup-with-handle buy point.


The stock soon pulled back with the general market, but found support above the prior entry and at the 10-week moving average.


Big Lots is now working on a flat base as part of a first-stage base-on-base formation.


On Wednesday, the stock hit resistance and bumped its head against the 53.45 entry before retreating to close below it. Volume rose to come in 15% higher than normal.


If Big Lots continues to pull back, look for volume to lighten up to show large investors are not selling aggressively. If the stock manages to clear the buy point, look for volume to be at least 40% above average on the day of the breakout.

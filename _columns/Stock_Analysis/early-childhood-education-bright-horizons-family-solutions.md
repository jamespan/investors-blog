Is early childhood education and workplace child-care provider **Bright Horizons Family Solutions** ([BFAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BFAM)) ready to graduate into a new buy zone? The answer may depend significantly on how the general market behaves in the coming days and weeks.




The stock market is currently in a [correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), but that can change quickly. And when it does, the best stocks tend to jump higher.


So build your list of [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) while the market is down, paying particular attention to stocks with solid fundamentals — and which are forming bases and getting ready to report earnings. Bright Horizons fits that bill.


A+ Funds Buy Into Early Childhood Education
-------------------------------------------


The Massachusetts-based company isn't among [today's fastest-growing stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/), but it does have a long track record of solid top- and bottom-line performance. Revenue gains have ranged from 5% to 13% over the last eight quarters. Sales growth came in at 10% in each of the last three reports.


Bright Horizons' earnings growth ranged from 14% to 30% during the last eight quarters. Analysts are looking for a 17% gain when the company reports Q3 earnings after the market close on Nov. 1. Estimates for 2018 (17%) and 2019 (15%) have both recently been revised higher by analysts.


In addition to and in conjunction with early childhood education services, the company provides child care, backup dependent care and educational advisory services to more than 1,100 clients. [Bright Horizons operates](https://www.brighthorizons.com/about-us) across the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, The Netherlands and India. Clients include 150 Fortune 500 companies.


Institutional demand for the stock has been strong. It's posted eight quarters of rising fund ownership, and 119 of the best mutual funds with an A+ IBD rating have a position in the stock. Bright Horizons also sports a 1.3 up/down volume ratio and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


With a 95 Composite Rating, Bright Horizons joins an elite group of [stocks outperforming 95% of all publicly traded companies](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). It also shares the No. 1 ranking in the Consumer Services-Education industry group with textbook supplier **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)).


Steady Climb For 324% Gain
--------------------------


Bright Horizons Family Solutions has been a steady climber since March 2013, when it came back on the market after being taken private by Bain Capital in 2008. The stock has consistently found support along its 10-week line throughout its 5-1/2 years of trading. Bright Horizons has risen 324% from its first weekly closing price through an all-time high of 120.07, which it hit in August of this year.


The stock has been building an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) since pulling back from that high. Its relative strength line remains within striking distance of a new 52-week high as the stock determines if the 10-week line will provide [support or resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


While now is not an ideal time to buy stocks, see if a new market uptrend begins and if Bright Horizons can clear the 120.17 buy point in heavy volume.


On Monday, the stock edged up 0.4%, leaving it 5% below the entry and 1.6% below its 50-day line. Note how the relative strength line is floating near a new 52-week high, a sign of resilience as the market corrects.

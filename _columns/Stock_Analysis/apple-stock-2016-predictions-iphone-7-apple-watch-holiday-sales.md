'Tis the season for making stock market predictions for the New Year. And from forecasts of [slowing iPhone sales in 2016](http://news.investors.com/technology-click/122315-786670-iphone-7-make-or-break-for-apple.htm) to the uncertain prospects of Apple Watch and a possible Apple TV streaming service, there's no shortage of speculation about tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

  

But to gauge the health and potential direction of Apple's stock, start by reading between the lines on its chart.

  

**Tracking The Over/Under**

  

Since fund managers and other large investors pay close attention to the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, seeing how a stock behaves around those key benchmarks is very revealing.

  

First, the shorter-term 10-week line should be above the longer-term 40-week moving average.

  

That was not the case when Apple went into a long correction in the fall of 2012 and the 10-week line fell below the 40-week benchmark. But in August 2013, that reversed, and the 10-week line got back above its longer-term cousin, which is a sign of renewed strength.

  

From there, Apple made a nice run for two years before the two lines crossed over again in August of this year.

  

For the iPhone and Apple Watch maker to launch a sustained new climb, the 10-week line will need to get back above the 40-week moving average. See if that happens in the New Year.

  

In the meantime, compare Apple's chart to that of current market leaders **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) to see the stark difference in their behavior around the key moving averages.

  

**Support Vs. Resistance**

  

You can also see the real story behind a stock by checking for support and resistance at the moving average lines.

  

During Apple's big move that began in 2013, look at how the stock generally found support at the 10-week line. But that changed as the stock started to run out of steam in June. The 10-week line went from being a floor of support to a ceiling of resistance.

  

Apple managed to get back above the 10-week line in late October, but it fell back below the mark earlier this month.

  

**What's The 'Line' On Apple?**

  

As predictions for Apple's holiday sales and upcoming iPhone 6C and iPhone 7 features pour in, continue to track the moving averages. Those key lines will give you an unbiased, objective look at the stock's technical strength or weakness to help you spot any changes in trend.

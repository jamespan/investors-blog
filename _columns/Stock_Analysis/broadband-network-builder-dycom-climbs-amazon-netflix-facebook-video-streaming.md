From **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), tech giants are aggressively expanding online video and streaming services.

  

That drives ever-increasing demand for faster broadband networks, and one company is particularly well-positioned to profit from that trend: **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)).

  

Dycom is the top-rated stock within the Telecom-Infrastructure group and currently holds the No. 1 spot on the IBD 50.

  

The Florida-based company provides network engineering, construction and maintenance services to the leading players in the telecom and cable TV industry, as well as gas and electric utilities.

  

It has over 11,000 employees and operates in all 50 states.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Demand for Dycom's network services is reflected in the three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, and three consecutive quarters of rising sales gains.

  

The building of a one gigabit per second (1 GBps) network service for **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and **CenturyLink** ([CTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTL)) has helped boost revenue.

  

The company is scheduled to report first quarter numbers for fiscal 2016 on Nov. 23.

  

Dycom sports the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and its industry group ranks No. 12. The B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and rising fund ownership in recent quarters shows demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After spending over a year trading essentially sideways, Dycom launched a new run in February.

  

It found support at the 10-week line along the way, including during the week of the Aug. 24 flash crash.

  

In its current base, the stock has found support along the 50-day line and several up days on heavy volume indicate buying by fund managers and other large investors.

  

Volume rose and came in above average on Monday as Dycom moved higher to close just below the 80.95 entry.

  

During Tuesday morning's session, the stock cleared the buy point and was still trading within the 80.95 - 85 buy zone.

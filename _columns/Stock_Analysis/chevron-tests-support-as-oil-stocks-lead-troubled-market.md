As **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) launches a carbon capture project to drive sustainability, [CVX stock](https://www.investors.com/research/chevron-stock-buy-now/) tests support at a key [moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).




In a sign of how [energy stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) have led the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Chevron joins **Cenovus Energy** ([CVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVE)), **EQT** ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)), **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) and others with the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/). All hail from the integrated oil & gas stocks industry group, which ranks No. 6 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Yet among Chevron and its industry peers, only **Williams Cos.** ([WMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMB)) earned a spot on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-aapl-brkb-pm-stock-in-market-correction-as-new-uptrend-awaits/).

Chevron Expands Sustainability And Renewables Initiatives
---------------------------------------------------------


With sales of $54 billion last quarter and a market capitalization of $328 billion, Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The company produces crude oil and natural gas, as well as transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals and additives.


With headquarters in San Ramon, Calif., Chevron continues to push its focus onÂ [sustainability](https://www.chevron.com/sustainability?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQK8tOMvjhyqYmrDC0BT8hdI24fcjCUMr0qRyIn-eGxMcuh4yVHhahAaAm59EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). That includes a push for a [lower carbon future](https://www.chevron.com/lower-carbon?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQLVVF9A2Semy3vlXmij7MDLS6jIZ1LXBnpA5eGFbYX0IoYjQpRLV2oaAnQ6EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [renewable natural gas](https://www.chevron.com/stories/things-to-know-about-renewable-natural-gas?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQKtrYveKpIcg55hwfDmG8-D2W16uP_4Tb00p2Luz2Yhgf-7dH1UYIwaAsfeEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).


Chevron has just launched a [carbon capture and storage project](https://www.chevron.com/newsroom/2022/q2/chevron-launches-carbon-capture-and-storage-project-in-san-joaquin-valley) aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of its operations in California's San Joaquin Valley. The oil and gas leader is also evaluating and deploying multiple carbon capture technology initiatives that could enable future projects for Chevron, as well other industries.


In addition to sanctioning the [Ballymore project](https://www.chevron.com/investors/press-releases) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico earlier this month, Chevron has also teamed up with agricultural giant **Bunge** ([BG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BG)) to expand renewable energy.


Signaling the close of a previously announced transaction, [Chevron and Bunge](https://chevroncorp.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chevron-bunge-launch-renewable-fuel-feedstocks-joint-venture) joined forces to create Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables. The new company aims to develop renewable fuel feedstocks. The partnership leverages Bunge's expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships and Chevron's expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing.


CVX Stock Stays Primed In Down Market
-------------------------------------


After flashing a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/) on Tuesday, the indexes immediately got hit with a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on Wednesday. Such action often spells doom for a new uptrend.


CVX stock briefly cleared a 174.86 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) on Tuesday but quickly retreated. In a sign of resilience, Chevron has managed to get back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The weekly chart shows that [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) was strong within the base as CVX stock touched a [new high](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/). As you like to see, downside volume has eased as the stock came off those heights.


With Chevron 5% below the initial buy point, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) remains at a new 52-week high.

Tenaris Expands Global Presence While Reducing Carbon Footprint
---------------------------------------------------------------


Tenaris is a leading manufacturer of pipes and related services for the world's energy industry and other industrial sectors. It also supply pipes and tubular components for low-carbon energy uses.


The company generated $6.5 billion revenue in 2021 and has around 23,000 employees.


Tenaris controls almost half of the world market and is the largest provider of steel tubing used to construct oil and gas wells. Its manufacturing system spans 16 countries. It is also pursuing capacity expansions in North America and the Middle East.


With an aggressive plan to [reduce its environmental and carbon footprint](https://www.tenaris.com/en/products-and-services/low-carbon-energy/), the Luxembourg-based steel firm provides solutions for hydrogen storage and transportation, geothermal and other renewables, and carbon emissions (COâ‚‚) abatement.


Growth And Dividend Drive Demand
--------------------------------


Over the last three quarters, Tenaris has generated average earnings growth of 191%, including an 84% gain in Q3. Analysts forecast 90% EPS growth in Q4 and a 128% gain for the full year. Wall Street sees that growth slowing to just 8% next year.


Over the last five quarters, sales increases have ranged from 70% to 100%.


Tenaris pays a dividend currently yielding 2.6% on an annualized basis. Top institutional investors have taken notice as 22 funds with an "A+" rating from IBD own shares in TS stock.


TS Stock Rebounds To Retake Buy Zone
------------------------------------


Tenaris first cleared a 34.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) on Nov. 15. The stock quickly came under pressure and fell below that entry, but quickly found support at its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


TS stock has now slipped just below the buy zone, with the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) easing mildly off its highs.


Its [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) is a second-stage base. Such early stage patterns are more likely to provide rich gains for investors.


Look for any downside volume to lighten and for upside volume to increase to show continued demand for a sustained climb.


Tenaris closed the week by reversing off Friday's lows to end at the top of its daily price range.

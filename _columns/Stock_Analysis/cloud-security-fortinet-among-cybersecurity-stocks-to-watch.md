Along with **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is one of the top cybersecurity stocks to watch. And the leader in cloud security is setting up a potential breakout move.




Unlike Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-splunk-stock-netflix-stock/). But it did see a big jump in fund ownership last quarter, from 1,046 to 1,240, marking a fifth straight quarter of rising institutional demand.


Based in Silicon Valley, Fortinet provides [cloud security](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), advanced threat protection, email and network security, and other services through its flagship firewall platform, FortiGate. Fortinet counts the majority of Fortune 500 companies as clients.

Cybersecurity Stocks Near A Buy Point
-------------------------------------


CyberArk is extended beyond its recent breakout, after soaring over 20% on Feb. 14 following a strong earnings report. But Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks and Proofpoint are closing in on new potential buy zones.


From a breakout in a double bottom in October 2017, Fortinet rose 138% before pulling back to form its current base in October of last year as a bear market took hold. The stock fell as much as 32% before finding a bottom. Since then, Fortinet has been rising steadily, recapturing its key moving averages along the way.


The relative strength line is already near a new 52-week high, and its 10-week line is above its longer-term 40-week moving average.


Heading into afternoon trading Tuesday, the stock is off 0.3%, putting it 8% below the 94.47 entry.



Palo Alto Networks stock gapped up Monday to a 1.6% gain, ending the session 2% below a 239.60 entry. As it gets ready to [report earnings after the close](https://www.investors.com/research/options/square-stock-earnings-options-trading/) today, Palo Alo is off slightly and is now 3% below the buy point. Proofpoint is also building a new base after gapping up to a 12.4% gain on Feb. 1 in reaction to a 38% increase in earnings. The profit growth marked a second quarter of acceleration. Proofpoint is testing resistance at the 120 mark.

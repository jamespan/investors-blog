As **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) continue to lead the fintech and mobile payments group, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) may place an order for a new breakout.


Mastercard, Visa and Global Payments are currently extended as they float around new all-time highs. But PayPal stock is showing signs of a rebound as it works on a [second-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 121.58 entry.


Among fellow [online payment stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansachs/), **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) and [Warren Buffett](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks-2/)-backed **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) are both testing new buy zones. Brazil-based **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) is still consolidating.


The industry ranks No. 93 out of the [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-industry-groups-growth-stocks-stock-market/).


PayPal Closes Honey Acquisition, Sweetens Deal With Citigroup
-------------------------------------------------------------


After posting seven quarters of EPS increases ranging from 25% to 48%, including two reports showing accelerating growth, PayPal fell to just a 5% increase in Q3.


The Silicon Valley-based company is expected to report Q4 and full-year 2019 earnings at the end of January. Analysts are looking for EPS to increase 20% in Q4 and 26% for the full year, according to FactSet.


Revenue for PayPal has ranged from 12% to 26% over the last eight quarters.


Earlier this month, PayPal completed its [acquisition of Honey](https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paypal-completes-acquisition-honey) for approximately $4 billion in cash. Based in Los Angeles, Honey notifies shoppers of price drops and shows consumers the lowest-available prices. It has around 17 million active users and is said to have saved shoppers over $1 billion in the last year.


In December, PayPal and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) expanded their partnership to enable Citigroup's institutional clients to [make payments into customer's PayPal digital wallets](https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/citi-and-paypal-extend-partnership-institutional-payments). The new arrangement allows PayPal and Citigroup to offer greater payment choice, flexibility and speed in making global payments.


Fintech Stocks To Watch: PayPal Stock Tries To Rebound
------------------------------------------------------


PayPal stock is approximately 5% shy of a potential new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is rising, but still short of a new 52-week high.


Trading has been tight in recent weeks, with the fintech leader finding support above its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). The stock popped above that benchmark line and retook its 200-day line on Jan. 6. Volume was slightly below average, but trade rose in the ensuing days.


In another sign of a technical rebound, PayPal's 10-day line has moved back above its 200-day line.


See if PayPal stock can complete its new saucer-shaped base and punch through the 121.58 buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.


On Friday, PayPal stock ended with a now 2.8% gain for the week, leaving it just 4% below the buy point.

**GlaxoSmithKline** ([GSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK)) partner **Innoviva** ([INVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVA)) is trying to buck the market correction and finish a new base.  The biotech stock recently received new European Union approval for Relvar Ellipta, an asthma drug Innoviva developed with GSK.




Last month, London-based GSK and California-based Innoviva announced that the European Commission approved a label upgrade for Relvar Ellipta. Known as Breo Ellipta in the U.S., Relvar Ellipta is a once-daily asthma treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years and older.


Last May, the Salford Lung Study showed Relvar Ellipta was [superior to other asthma drugs](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/gsks-relvar-ellipta-comes-top-real-world-study/), including Symbicort from **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)).


Biotech Stock With 112% Earnings Growth
---------------------------------------


In Q4, Innoviva reported a 112% spike in earnings growth, bringing its average EPS gain over the last three quarters to 100%. Sales growth has ranged from 46% to 250% over the last eight reports.


Innoviva is expected to report Q1 earnings around April 25, with analysts looking for 189% growth.


With an 88 Composite Rating, Innoviva holds the No. 19 spot among [leading biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), which group ranks No. 9 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Halozyme Therapeutics** ([HALO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HALO)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) are among the top-rated stocks in the group.


Market Correction-Resistant?
----------------------------


While it's difficult for any stock to make a sustained climb during a [market correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), Innoviva has been showing resilience as it works on a flat base with a 17.31 buy point.


Its relative strength line is near a 52-week high, and despite Monday's market sell-off, the stock has found support at its 10-day moving average. In early trading Tuesday, Innoviva was up around 1%, putting it 3% below the entry.


So while it's risky to buy any breakout stock during a market correction, Innoviva is among the [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) as we wait for a new market uptrend.


GlaxoSmithKline has managed to retake its 200-day line, but note that GSK's 50-day moving average is below the longer-term 200-day line, a sign of technical weakness.

As an early adopter of [mobile payment systems](http://news.investors.com/business/091515-771078-starbucks-mobile-order-pay-rapid-adoption.htm) like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) Pay, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) is showing how the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution can also connect customers to their coffee. And that has Starbucks' stock percolating near a new potential buy point.


Using the coffee giant's Mobile Order & Pay technology, customers can order drinks ahead of time on a smartphone app for in-store pick-up.


In August, mobile payments made up an estimated 21.6% of total sales, up from 16.4% in June.


And Mobile Order & Pay is currently only available on the Apple iPhone, which makes up less than half of the smartphone market.


Expect even more mobile Macchiato orders when the technology rolls out to **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Android devices later this month.


**Key Fundamentals**


Starbucks has posted two straight quarters of rising earnings growth, with a 24% increase in Q2. Sales growth has come in at 18% in each of the last two reports.


For the full year, analysts see a 20% rise in earnings, followed by an 18% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


The Seattle-based company has a robust 42% return on equity, helping it earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.


That's made the stock a favorite among institutional investors.


The number of funds with a position in Starbucks has been rising in recent quarters, and four typically better-performing mutual funds, including **Fidelity Contrafund** and **American Century All Cap Growth** , have reported a stake in the stock.


Along with Netflix and Amazon, Starbucks has also been among the best performers within the [Top 25 holdings](http://news.investors.com/investing-etfs/091615-771310-heavily-traded-etfs-rebound-but-off-highs.htm) in the **PowerShares QQQ** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF.


Plus, on Wednesday, Moody's upgraded the company's credit rating, citing its "measured growth strategy, product pipeline, digital initiatives and balanced financial policy."


**Chart Analysis**


Like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and several other market leaders, Starbucks pulled back sharply during the Aug. 24 flash crash, but the stock rebounded from its lows before the close.


Since then it has continued to edge higher and reclaimed its 10-week moving average.


It's now working on the right side of a new base with a 59.42 buy point.


Starbucks' Relative Strength line has been nearing new high ground, meaning the stock is outperforming the general market.

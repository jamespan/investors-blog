**Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) has a lot to smile about. As the world's largest 3D printing manufacturer and creator of the Invisalign clear dental alignment system, ALGN stock may sink its pearly whites into a new breakout and all-time high with Q1 earnings due.




The [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-building-positions-growth-stock/) are also grinning, with 220 funds with an A+ rating from IBD owning ALGN stock.

3D Printing Has Align Technology Stock Smiling
----------------------------------------------


Led by its flagship Invisalign, Align Technology is a global medical device company providing digital orthodontic and restorative workflows. Align has helped doctors treat over 9.6 million patients with the Invisalign system.


Produced using digital and 3D technologies. Invisalign clear aligners provide a removable and transparent teeth-straightening solution.Â In 2018, Align Technology teamed up with 3D printing pioneer **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) to help manufacture the Invisalign clear aligners.


After establishing new corporate headquarters in Tempe, Ariz., in January, Align Technology just announced the expansion of its global operations. The company will open a new manufacturing facility in Poland to meet opportunities in the large and underpenetrated Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. That market represents over 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million potential EMEA consumers for Align Technology.


Joining Juarez, Mexico, and Ziyang, China, the new Wroclaw plant will be Align's first in the EMEA region and its third plant worldwide.


ALGN Stock Trying To Line Up New Breakout
-----------------------------------------


As many of the best growth stocks did, ALGN stock soared off the coronavirus lows in March 2020.


ALGN stock bolted nearly 40% higher the week ended Oct. 23 after reporting Q3 earnings. The stock jumped another 18% the first week of February after reporting Q4 earnings, but then quickly pulled back.


With Q1 earnings set for April 28, ALGN stock bounced back to form a [cup shape base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), retaking its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) along the way. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) lagged while the [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) formed but is now rebounding.


On Friday, ALGN stock edged just under 1% higher, putting it within 2% of the 634.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

 After **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) announced it was buying **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)), speculation turned to what the retail behemoth might bite into next. At least one analyst says **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) may be on the menu.
Media outlets widely reported an investor note from Wedbush analyst Aaron Turner, who argued Grubhub's mobile platform that connects hungry diners with takeout restaurants could give Amazon an edge in the food-delivery business.


True or not, the rumor gave Grubhub's stock a boost Monday, lifting it over 5% and putting it within striking distance of a new buy zone, which it tested on Wednesday.


Fast-Growing IBD 50 Stock
-------------------------


Based in Chicago, Grubhub has more than 55,000 restaurant partners in more than 1,100 U.S. cities and London. The company serves approximately 8.8 million active diners.


The 2014 IPO and [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member has strong three-year annual growth rates for both earnings (68%) and sales (43%).


Grubhub has posted 47% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, including a jump from 21% to 45% in Q1.


Within the Internet-Content industry, Grubhub, **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and [leading Chinese internet stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) all sport the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.


The group ranks No. 4 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Earlier this month, Grubhub announced it was buying Foodler, an online food-ordering company based in Boston. Grubhub said Foodler would add $80 million of annualized gross food sales in 2017.


Ready To Deliver New Breakout?
------------------------------


After breaking out of a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) with a 42.35 buy point, Grubhub has built a new base — and flashed two positive signs of support.


First, the stock found support at the 10-week moving average, a key benchmark large investors use to gauge support and resistance.


Second, the bottom of the new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) is right around the prior buy point. Such action is healthy and could mean Grubhub is building steppingstones for a new climb.


The new buy point is 46.94, 10 cents above the peak on the left of the pattern.


On Wednesday, Grubhub jumped into the buy zone during the session, but pulled back to close below it. Still, the stock was up was up over 2% for the day and just 1% below the entry. Volume was more than 50% above average.


See if Grubhub can retake the buy point in heavy trade.

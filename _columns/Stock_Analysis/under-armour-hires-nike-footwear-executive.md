With the [market uptrend now under pressure](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/012815-736838-markets-bearish-reversal-prompts-shift-in-outlook.htm), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) hopes continued growth in its moisture-wicking athletic apparel will also keep its stock from over-sweating.

  

To help the company's earnings growth stay on track, Under Armour is trying to aggressively grow its footwear business. Already, shoe sales jumped 50% to $122 million in Q3, up from $81 million in the third quarter of 2013. Earlier this week, Under Armour hired a former **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) exec to take over the footwear division.

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Overall revenue growth has been strong and steady, coming in between 23% and 36% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has been more sporadic, but jumped back to 21% in Q3.

  

Under Armour is scheduled to report fourth quarter numbers on Feb. 4. For 2014, analysts see EPS rising 25%, followed by a 29% gain this year.

  

The company has a 17% return on equity and three-year annual EPS growth rate of 31%, helping it earn a 95 Composite Rating. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a solid B, and the number of funds that own Under Armour has been on the rise in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Under Armour's weekly chart looks like a training course for one of its athletes, displaying a few obstacles and several bases as it has generally continued to trend higher.

  

The stock is now working on a later-stage base. Those can be more risky, especially when the overall market uptrend is under pressure, as it is now.

  

It's a shallow cup-with-handle, with a long handle. Much of that handle was formed at or just below the 10-week line, but last week, Under Armour moved back above that benchmark. Volume that week was rising and above average, a sign that institutional investors may be stepping in to support the stock.

  

The buy point is 73.08, 10 cents above the peak in the handle. Since mid-January, Under Armour has been getting closer to that entry price and volume has been picking up as the stock tries to complete the right side of the base.

  

On Wednesday, the Nasdaq and S&P sold off sharply on rising volume and Under Armour also pulled back. But on the positive side, the Relative Strength line remained strong. The question now is, will that continue? Or will Under Armour also start to retreat?

  

If Under Armour can post another strong quarter when it reports Feb. 4 and find its footing in the footwear business, it could be one to watch.

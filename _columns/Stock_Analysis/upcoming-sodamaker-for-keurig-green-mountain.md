**Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) made its mark with K-Cup single-serve coffee and Keurig brewers. Competition heated up when key patents expired in 2012, letting rivals sell similar products.


But Keurig has continued to innovate and, later this year, will release a new machine that brews entire carafes of coffee, as well as single-serve cups. And Keurig Cold, an at-home soda maker, is due out in 2015. In February, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) bought 16% of Keurig to tap into the do-it-yourself soda market.


**Key Fundamentals**


Sales growth the past six quarters has been below the 25% gains you prefer to see, but revenue did rebound into double digits in Q1.


Earnings have been decelerating over the past three quarters, but see if that turns around when the company reports second-quarter numbers on Wednesday.


Keurig has a solid 21% return on equity and 97 Composite Rating. Its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to demand for the stock, and the number of funds that own the stock has been rising in recent quarters.


**Chart Analysis**


After a huge sell-off beginning in September 2011, Keurig Green Mountain rebounded and reclaimed its old high earlier this year, helped by a 33% one-week gain in February on news of the deal with Coca-Cola.


It then formed an awkward cup with handle and tried to break out in June. But it failed to gain traction and has since been working on a flat base with a 128.60 buy point.


Keurig had been finding support at its 10-week moving average, but hasn't rallied from that level. With the market acting poorly, it's best to limit new buys. But still be on watch for a breakout in heavy trade. An earnings surprise could spark the stock.

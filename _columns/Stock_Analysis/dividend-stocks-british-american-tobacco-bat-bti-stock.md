Amid [market corrections](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-corrections-how-to-sell-stocks-manage-risk-and-prepare-for-next-uptrend/) and extended downturns, some investors are turning to high-yielding dividend stocks while traditional growth names such as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stumble. One such name attracting income investors is **British American Tobacco** ([BTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTI)), whose stock currently yields 7% on an annualized basis.


Investors are attracted by the company's strong cash flow, and shares of British American Tobacco stock have perked up since last April. While it remains risky to buy stocks in the current market environment, British American Tobacco is aiming to complete a new [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/) with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) notching a 52-week high.




British American Tobacco Going Smokeless
----------------------------------------


Founded in 1902 and home to iconic cigarette brands like Camel, Lucky Strike and Dunhill, British American Tobacco, or BAT, is making a strategic shift to a [smokeless world](https://www.asmokelessworld.com/gb/en?utm_source=bat_com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=omni_launch_2024&utm_content=homepage_science).


Recognizing that the world and its customers are changing, the company plans to become a predominantly smokeless business by 2035. It continues to expand its lineup of smokeless products like Vuse, Glo and Velo.


BAT has more than 48,000 employees, with its products sold in more than 140 markets around the world. Across the company's three geographic groups, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of both revenue and profits.


While sales and earnings growth has been spotty and sporadic, [cash flow](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-cash-flow-may-matter-more-than-profits-sales/) remains strong. In the fourth quarter, BAT generated $8.41 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.21 per share.


Last year, cash flow came in at $6.31 per share. In a nutshell, cash flow describes how much cash goes in and out of a business. How much went out in operating costs and how much came in from investments and financing operations are all part of the statement of cash flows.


A good benchmark to look for is cash flow per share at least 20% higher than earnings per share. In 2024, that number for BAT was 40%.

BAT Among Top Dividend Stocks To Watch
--------------------------------------


Fueled by its strong cash flow and 7% annualized yield, British American Tobacco ranks among the [best dividend stocks](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/). It earns an [89 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-british-amer-tobacco-adr-bti.aspx) out of a possible 99.


Signs of demand for shares include a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and a 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-up-down-volume-ratio-spots-underlying-demand-for-stocks/). A total of 117 funds with an A+ rating from Investor's Business Daily own shares of British American Tobacco stock.


British American Tobacco continues to work on an early stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) with a 41.87 buy point. The stock fell Wednesday, but held support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). On Thursday, BAT rose over 4% in heavy trade, retaking its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


[The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/) emphasizes the elevated risk of making new buys in the current market conditions. But dividend stocks like BAT — with share prices holding up relatively well compared to the general market — can offer an alternative to growth stocks for investors seeking to generate income.

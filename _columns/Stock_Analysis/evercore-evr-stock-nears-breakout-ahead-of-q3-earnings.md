With Q3 earnings due Oct. 27, global investment advisor **Evercore** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) expects a fourth straight quarter of 100%-plus EPS growth. After already delivering average increases of 129% over the last three quarters, analysts expect the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock to post a 168% earning increase.




Those estimates have earned Evercore a spot among [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/research/fast-growing-stocks-q3-earnings-estimates/). It joins fellow IBD 50 stocks **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


To make that [stock screen](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/), Evercore, [GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) and these other top growth stocks must have a 95 or higher [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) and meet other [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) criteria.

Evercore Makes List Of New Buys By The Best Mutual Funds
--------------------------------------------------------


Based in the heart of Wall Street in New York City, Evercore is a global independent banking advisory firm involved in mergers and acquisitions, as well as serving as a strategic shareholder advisor. With a global footprint, it maintains offices in major financial centers in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.


In one sign of strong institutional demand, Evercore made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-googl-stock-tech-stocks-but-stock-market-correction-hits/). It joins 10 other firms from the investment banks and brokers industry group, including **Jefferies Financial** ([JEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JEF)) and **Charles Schwab** ([SCWH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCWH)).


It sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and a solid 1.7 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/). Plus, 54 funds with an A or A+ rating from IBD own shares in EVR stock.


Evercore Looks To Bankroll Breakout And All-Time High
-----------------------------------------------------


In a sign of stock market leadership, Evercore's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is climbing as the stock flashes a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Evercore stock just formed an early stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) showing a 151.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


On Friday, EVR stock rose over 2%, lifting it into into a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). Volume was below that of Thursday but came in slightly above average.


With earnings due on Oct. 27, keep in mind that it's risky to buy stocks just before they report.


See if Evercore can deliver on the big estimates Wall Street expects and continue to push the stock to new all-time highs.

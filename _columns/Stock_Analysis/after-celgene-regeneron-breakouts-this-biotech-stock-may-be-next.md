 With biotech stocks like **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Bluebird Bio** ([BLUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLUE)), **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) spinoff **Bioverativ** ([BIVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIVV)) on the move, cancer treatment developer **Exelixis** ([EXEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXEL)) may be poised to pop into a new buy zone.
Exelixis' share price has soared this week following confirmation of positive results from a Phase 2 trial. The so-called CABOSUN trial compared cabozantinib, which Exelixis uses in its Cabometyx kidney cancer treatment, to sunitinib, used in PFE Sutent from **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)).


A blinded independent radiology review committee (IRC) found cabozantinib "demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death."


Fellow cancer treatment stock Celgene bolted past a buy point Wednesday in huge volume, while Regeneron added to its gains from an earlier breakout and closed the day up over 13% for the week. Both stocks added to those gains on Thursday. Several other [top biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) also made strong gains.


2017 IPO Bioverativ broke out Monday and closed Thursday's session about 4% above the 58.98 buy point.


Triple-Digit Growth
-------------------


Exelixis has generated explosive sales growth over the last four quarters, ranging from 354% to 680%. Quarterly revenue has risen from $36 million to nearly $81 million during that time.


Earnings growth has ranged from 105% to 167% over the last three reports, but note that those gains are based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters with no earnings.


Institutional investors have taken notice, and the number of funds with a position in Exelixis has risen in each of the last four quarters.


The stock currently sports a B+ Accumulation-Distribution Rating and 1.4 Up-Down Volume Ratio.


Biotech Breakout Ahead?
-----------------------


As of Wednesday's close, Exelixis was up nearly 25% for the week, with its relative strength line trending sharply higher.


Volume has been well above average in recent days as the stock has retaken its 50-day line and continued to climb.



Exelixis made a huge run from a breakout last June, but the stock reset its base count in May when it undercut the low in the prior consolidation. That means its current cup-shaped pattern is considered a first-stage base.


The potential buy point is 24.95.


On Thursday, Exelixis recouped earlier, mild drop to end the day in positive territory.  Volume was once again above average.


Look for the biotech boom to continue and for Exelixis to jump past the entry in heavy volume.

**Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) is trying to follow the lead of fellow telecom titan **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) and launch a successful breakout.


As of Wednesday's close, AT&T was trading 7% above its most recent buy point, which it cleared on June 7. Verizon has been testing a 54.59 entry in recent days and ended the Wednesday session just under 1% above the pivot.


AT&T and Verizon rank No. 1 and 2, respectively, within their industry group, and both have been rumored to be [possible suitors for Yahoo](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dish-stock-downgraded-on-unlikely-spectrum-sale-downward-pressure/). The web portal's annual shareholder meeting Thursday may shed more light on that subject.


Industry watchers have also speculated that [Verizon or AT&T may acquire radio spectrum](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dish-stock-downgraded-on-unlikely-spectrum-sale-downward-pressure/) from **Dish Network** ([DISH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DISH)) for a hypothetical price tag of $30 billion. But MoffettNathanson Research doesn't expect either company -- or fellow potential buyers **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) or **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) -- to foot that bill.


On Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission released the [first-round results from the government spectrum auction](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/att-verizon-and-broadcasters-set-for-game-of-chicken-in-fcc-auction/) and said 126 megahertz of spectrum will be available in a second round of bidding. AT&T, Verizon, **T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) and **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) are expected to participate, but the amount of spectrum available may be [more than bidders are willing to buy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/whats-at-stake-for-dish-comcast-att-verizon-in-long-tv-auction/).


Demand For Dividends
--------------------


In an uncertain, choppy market, fund managers and other institutional investors may turn to megacap stocks with a solid dividend to help them weather the storm.


AT&T, which has a $260 billion market cap, currently has a slight edge with a 4.5% yield, topping Verizon's 4.1% payout. Verizon's market cap stands at $220 billion.


Both companies saw rising fund ownership last quarter.


Dial 'B' For Breakout
---------------------


After closing higher for 10 of 11 weeks starting in January, Verizon pulled back to begin forming its current base.


Since finding a bottom in that consolidation in late May, the stock has been climbing steadily and is on pace to close higher for a sixth straight week.


Verizon held its ground on June 24 and 27 as the markets fell sharply following the Brexit vote.


As of Thursday morning, the stock was still trading within a 54.59-57.32 buy range.

Back in 2020, **Life Time Holdings** ([LTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTH)) became the first health and fitness club to offer Apple Fitness+ to its members. Today, as the bear market and President Donald Trump's [tariffs](https://www.investors.com/tag/trump-tariffs-international-trade/) take a big bite out of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), shares of Life Time stock remain healthy — and near their all-time high.


As the relative strength line for [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-price-target-cuts-morgan-stanley-keybanc/) has drifted down, the RS line for Life Time earns a coveted [blue dot in Investor's Business Daily's MarketSurge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-technical-analysis-marketsurge/), a sign of market leadership. That strength is boosted by a budding breakout and Wall Street forecasts of 117% earnings growth when Life Time next reports on May 8. But in this type of market, all potential buy points come with cautionary caveats.




Life Time Not Resting On Its Luxury Laurels
-------------------------------------------


With a portfolio of 180 athletic country clubs across the United States and Canada, a Life Time facility aims to be more wellness retreat than mere gym. At their country clubs, members are offered activities and special events, including yoga, tennis, pickleball and beyond. The Life Time app provides a digital classes, guided meditations, training programs and more.


On April 10, Life Time announced its [acquisition of High Performance Lifestyle Training](https://news.lifetime.life/2025-04-10-Life-Time-Acquires-High-Performance-Lifestyle-Training-HPLT-to-Complement-Health-and-Wellness-Experiences-in-NYC-and-Beyond), or HPLT. The deal aims to further extend Life Time's presence in the health and wellness landscape in New York City and beyond. HPLT events will be integrated into Life Time with access to retreats, self-development and growth workshops.


Named one of [Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies](https://www.fastcompany.com/91270243/wellness-personal-care-most-innovative-companies-2025-life-time-fitness-homecourt-frida-akita-biosciences-alice-mushrooms-stakt-january-ai-seed-health-wahoo) in wellness and personal care for 2025, Life Time ranks No. 1 among its peers in the Leisure-Services group. It earns a [94 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-life-time-group-holdings-lth.aspx) from IBD, topping industry peers **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)).


Apple stock, by comparison, has seen its [Composite Rating fall to 73](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-aapl.aspx).


Life Time was profiled on IBD's [New America page on Feb. 7](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/luxury-gyms-fitness-centers-life-time-stock-lth/), noting that nearly half, 46%, of its members are under age 35. The median income is $157,000.

Continued Strong Growth Expected
--------------------------------


When Life Time reports its first-quarter results on May 8, analysts expect a 117% spike in earnings growth to 26 cents per share and 14% sales growth to $682.8 million.


For the full year, analysts predict 29% earnings growth to $1.23 per share. In 2026, Wall Street forecasts a 22% gain to $1.50 per share.


The stock has seen six quarters of rising fund ownership. A total of 17 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD own shares.


Life Time Stock Getting A Workout
---------------------------------


As Life Time retakes and remains above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), it continues to work on a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/?_gl=1*1hdzp1t*_gcl_au*MjA3OTk2MTM5My4xNzQzNzA3NDMwLjEyNzYxMjgzNzQuMTc0NDgyNzM2My4xNzQ0ODI3NTI5*_ga*MTEyODE4NTY0MC4xNzM2ODkxMTA4*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0NDgwNzUyNi41MjUuMS4xNzQ0ODI3NTMyLjU4LjAuMA..#doublebottom), a common pattern in volatile markets. The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 32.85.


But Life Time is by no means immune to market mayhem and volatility. With the Nasdaq gapping down on Wednesday as Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said Trump tariffs may create a "[challenging scenario](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chief-jerome-powell-trump-tariffs-tension-inflation-growth-dow-jones/)," shares of Life Time pulled back to successfully test support at the 50-day line. The stock continues to hold tight above that benchmark on Thursday.


While it has fared much better than Apple and most growth stocks, caution remains king for all stocks, including Life Time. But a strong earnings outlook and high relative strength make Life Time a stock to watch as investors wait for a market rebound.

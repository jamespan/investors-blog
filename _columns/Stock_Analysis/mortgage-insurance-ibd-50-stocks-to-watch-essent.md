Focusing on the [top-rated stocks in the top-ranked industries](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-find-the-top-rated-stocks-in-the-top-ranked-industries/) is always a good way to start your search for the best stocks to watch. And mortgage insurance provider **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) fits that bill as it enters a new buy zone in a first-stage base.




With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Essent shares top billing among mortgage-related stocks with **NMI Holdings** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)). The group itself ranks No. 2 out of 197 industries, up from 174 six months ago — a sign that institutional investors have been investing in this field.


Essent also has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of [today's top growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/).

Rising Institutional Demand
---------------------------


In addition to mortgage insurance, Essent offers reinsurance and risk management products to mortgage lenders and investors to support homeownership.


Headquartered in Bermuda, Essent has a solid track record of strong earnings and sales growth, exactly what mutual fund managers like to see. Revenue gains have ranged from 20% to 31% over the last eight quarters, while earnings growth has come in between 16% and 66% over the same period. The company showed accelerating EPS growth in Q4.


Signs of strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) for Essent stock include an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.9 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.


Essent Resets Base Count After 68% Run
--------------------------------------


Essent broke out of a first-stage cup with handle right when the stock market revved up following the November 2016 election. From a 28.72 buy point, the stock rose 68% before retreating to form its current [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), beginning in January 2018.


While forming that chart pattern, Essent [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) by undercutting the low in its prior pattern. The base is now 60 weeks long, with a decline of 38% within the consolidation.


After finding a bottom in December, the stock posted eight consecutive up weeks before edging lower to form a handle. The buy point is now 45.16.


On Monday, Essent rose over 5% in volume more than 300% above average, lifting it into buy range which extends to 47.42.

 While e-commerce giant **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) try to clear 1,000 per share, discount retailer and [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) is testing a new buy zone ahead of earnings.
Fellow discounter **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) reported May 31, and has been soaring Thursday in heavy volume. Now teen-focused Five Below is on deck to report after the close.


While both Amazon, Alphabet and Ollie's have all already broken out to solid gains, Five Below is still floating right around a potential new buy zone.


5 Is The Magic Number
---------------------


Five Below offers a broad range of "trend-right, high-quality" merchandise for preteen and teenage shoppers, with everything priced at or under $5.


On May 5, Five Below opened its 555th store, more than doubling its store count over the last five years. It now has locations in 32 states.


The 2012 IPO ranks No. 2 among its peers in the Retail-Discount & Variety industry group, just behind Ollie's Bargain Outlet. **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) round out the top five.


But the group ranks a lowly No. 139 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Five Below's earnings growth has slowed in each of the last three quarters, coming in at 17% in the latest report. See if the Philadelphia-based company can reverse that trend when it reports on Thursday.


Sales growth edged higher last quarter, from 18% to 19%. Revenue gains have now ranged from 18% to 25% over the last eight quarters.


Heading Above Or Below Long Term Resistance?
--------------------------------------------


Five Below has struggled to make a sustained upward climb since its market debut in 2012.


It's now working on a second-stage cup with handle that is both long (42 weeks) and deep (34% decline).


The 52.73 buy point is just below the stock's long-term point of resistance of around 55 that it hit back in November 2013.


Five Below temporarily cleared the entry on May 18, but has struggled to stay above that price. On Wednesday, the stock closed nearly 2% lower, but did manage to recoup some of the day's decline and close in the upper half of the price range. It was up almost one percent heading into the final hour of trading on Thursday.


The stock sports a strong 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio, but its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has slipped from a B+ to a B- as Five Below has pulled back this week. The relative strength line has also dipped after trending clearly upward as the stock built the right side of its base, but it remains within striking distance of new high ground.


All eyes now shift to Five Below's earnings report, which will be the key factor in determining whether it heads north or south.

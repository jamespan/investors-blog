Legendary Fidelity fund manager Peter Lynch says to invest in what you know. But just seeing a long line at **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) or realizing all your friends use **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) isn’t enough. You need to review the fundamentals and the chart.


If you enjoy beer, wine or spirits, **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) may be a prime candidate for further “research.”


While not a household name, Constellation is the largest supplier of alcohol in the U.S., with a wide range of brands including Corona beer, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky and Robert Mondavi wines. And its 98 Composite Rating is tops among its peers in the No. 14-ranked alcoholic beverages industry group as of Friday's IBD.


Why Are Top Fund Managers Buying Constellation Brands?
------------------------------------------------------


On Jan. 7, the com[![ISAstz020116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ISAstz020116-300x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ISAstz020116.jpg)pany beat earnings and sales estimates for its fiscal 2016 third quarter, which ended Nov. 30.


Mutual fund managers look for a track record of solid profitability, and Constellation’s three-year annual EPS growth rate of 38% certainly qualifies. That’s one reason its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has risen to an A-, while ratings for several big name stocks like Amazon and Facebook fell to an E during this year’s market sell-off.


 


Constellation also made IBD’s latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, with 46 funds investing a total of $169 million last quarter.


Showing Support And Resilience
------------------------------


Constellation’s stock has been a steady climber, showing tight trading and consistent support at its 10-week moving average, even in the face of this year’s rocky market. But there is a catch: if the stock forms a new chart pattern, it will be a riskier later-stage base.


That said, the relative strength line shows the stock has been outperforming the general market, and higher volume on up weeks shows fund managers are continuing to accumulate shares.

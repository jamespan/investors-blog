Software Stocks Featured On IBD Screens
---------------------------------------


Salesforce joins several of its industry peers on IBD's [premiere stock screens](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). The CRM leader has earned a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), IBD's most stringent screen.


ServiceNow and Paycom Software are also on Sector Leaders, and on the [IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Twilio, which went public in 2016, is featured on the [IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).


The CRM business has been a profitable one for Salesforce. Over the last three years, the San Francisco-based company has posted average annual earnings growth of 44%. Salesforce has generated average EPS growth of 48% over the last three quarters.


Revenue gains have been solid and steady, ranging from 25% to 27% over the last eight reports.


Analysts expect 17% earnings growth when Salesforce reports Q4 numbers sometime in late February or early March.


Can CRM Leader Manage New Breakout?
-----------------------------------


In April 2017, Salesforce cleared a long-term [area of resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) around 82 to launch a 91% climb over the next 19 months. The stock showed tight trading and consistent support at its 10-week line along the way.


As the general stock market fell into a bear market in Q4 2017, Salesforce also pulled back, ultimately retreating 30% to form its current, second-stage consolidation. The stock has now retaken its 10-week moving average, but that benchmark line remains just below the longer-term 40-week moving average. See if the 10-week line can move back above its longer-term cousin to further show a technical rebound.


Salesforce's relative strength line has been trending higher while building the right side of its current consolidation. The RS line is now floating just below a new 52-week high, a sign of market leadership.


On Tuesday, the stock fell along with the indexes, and closed the day off 2.3% at 148.97. Volume was below average. In morning trading Wednesday, Salesforce is up 0.7%, putting it 8% below the 161.29 buy point.

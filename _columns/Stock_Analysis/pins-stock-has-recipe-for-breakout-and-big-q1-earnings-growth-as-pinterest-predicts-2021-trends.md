Topping fellow internet stocks **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), social media leader **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) scores a highest possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). With Q1 earnings due April 27, PINS stock may have the recipe for a [new breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).




Boosted by 258% earnings-per-share growth last quarter and average annual sales growth of 50% over the last three years, [PINS stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pins-stock-buy-now/) has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).


[GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) is also on the IBD Big Cap 20 list of [leading large caps](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-or-sell-large-cap-stocks/). Like Pinterest, [Facebook](https://www.investors.com/research/fb-stock-buy-now-facebook-stock/) and Alphabet have a Composite Rating above 95, thus earning a passing grade in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


While FB stock and GOOGL stock are holding tight, PINS stock suffered a pinprick Friday, deflating its recent momentum.

Pinterest Pictures Big Growth In Q1 And 2021
--------------------------------------------


Using the Pinterest social media platform, people have saved more than 300 billion Pins across a range of interests ranging from creating a home office to cooking a new recipe to finding their next vacation spot.


Analysts expect the San Francisco-based company to pin down another quarter of stellar gains when it reports Q1 earnings on April 27. Wall Street watchers expect Pinterest to post 160% EPS growth in Q1 and a 105% increase in 2021.


Having only gone public two years ago, in April 2019, PINS stock has quickly become a favorite of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-building-positions-growth-stock/). In a sign of strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), 237 funds with an A+ rating own shares in PINS stock. Plus, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and MFS Growth (MFEGX) have a position in Pinterest.


Fidelity Contrafund and MFS Growth also have stakes in Facebook and GOOGL stock.


Pinterest Predictions For 2021
------------------------------


With more than 450 million people using Pinterest, the company puts out [Pinterest Predicts](https://business.pinterest.com/content/pinterest-predicts/), a trend report on the preferences and stylistic tastes of the Pinterest community. In 2020, the company said that eight out of 10 of Pinterest's predictions for 2020 came true.


The social media company has now released its predictions for 2021, filtered by audience and category.


In the travel category, the company says "[Parking space is the new personal space](https://business.pinterest.com/content/pinterest-predicts/getaway-car)." Cars, it says, will become the new "third space" for everything from date nights to man caves. Pinterest found that trending search terms in that genre include car date night, drive-in cinema, car man cave, dog car seats, and car survival kits.


In the home category, Pinterest says "[cloffice (closed door office) is the new home office](https://business.pinterest.com/content/pinterest-predicts/more-door)," noting that it's time to say goodbye to open floor plans. User trends show that even when doors aren't available, people will find new ways to create a little personal space.

Can PINS Stock Pin Down New Breakout?
-------------------------------------


After rocketing 790% from its March 2020 low, PINS stock pulled back to form its current [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Despite that huge run, the current consolidation is still a first-stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has fallen off its highs. After trying to rebound, the RS line trended lower again Friday as PINS stock sold off nearly 10% in heavy volume. Pinterest fell through its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), managing to come off its lows but not enough to retake that benchmark line.


As GOOGL stock becomes slightly extended, FB stock is testing a new breakout.

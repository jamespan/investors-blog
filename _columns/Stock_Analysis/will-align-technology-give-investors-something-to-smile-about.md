 If you had braces as a kid, you probably remember the woven metal brackets and wires. Well, **Align Technology**  ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) has developed an alternative way to straighten teeth.

  

Earlier this year the firm introduced a new material for its Invisalign clear aligner system. It's called SmartTrack and it is made of a highly elastic material that keeps its shape better and has a more consistent force over the two weeks a patient wears the device.

  

And as a [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/110813-678554-align-technology-innovates-invisible-braces.htm) in Monday's paper noted, the orthodontists and general practitioners who prescribe Invisalign to patients say the old material in such aligners would hold its form very well for the first four or five days, then lose shape.

  

The new SmartTrack aligner holds its shape much better, so it moves teeth more effectively.

  

In June, the company also introduced Realine, an entry-level, five-stage clear aligner that helps with minor overcrowding and spacing issues of teeth that a general practitioner can help fix. The firm also makes the Invisalign Express and Lite treatments that can fix minor corrections.

  

The teenage market for Invisalign's products has been growing steadily since late 2012. Last quarter, the firm had 29,000 teenage users, a 23% increase from a year earlier.

  

And the international market for the firm's products is also growing. In the third quarter, Align's international sales were up 31% year over year and they made up 24% of the firm's overall sales.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth slowed late last year and was flat in the first quarter of year. But since then has accelerated, hitting 62% last quarter. 

  

• Sales growth also improved, but is still a little shy of the 25% minimum typically seen in winning growth stocks. 

  

• Overall, analysts expect earnings to climb 30% this year and 16% next year. 

  

****Stock Checkup**** 

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-align-technology-inc-algn.aspx) shows Align's 98 Composite Rating is the best among the 66 stocks in its Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 22 among IBD's 197 groups, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows Align broke out of a first-stage, cup-shaped base this summer and launched a new climb. It paused last month and pulled back below the 50-day moving average line.

  

Then the stock got a big boost Oct. 18, hitting a new high, after its third quarter sales and earnings results easily beat views. Since then the stock has traded in a fairly tight, narrow price range.

  

If you look Align's weekly chart, you'll notice the weekly price changes have been more than 1%. So they're a little too wide to qualify as a three-weeks-tight. That pattern typically has weekly price changes of only around 1%

  

Still, Align may be worth keeping on your watch list to see if it gives investors other opportunities to get on board going forward.

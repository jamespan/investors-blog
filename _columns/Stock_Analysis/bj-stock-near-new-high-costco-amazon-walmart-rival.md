While dwarfed by retail giants **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **BJ's Wholsale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) is no small-time player, with nearly $13 billion in annual sales. After gapping up to a 30% gain the week ended May 22, BJ stock is testing resistance just below an all-time high.




In their most recent quarters, Costco ($37.3 billion), Walmart ($134.6 billion) and Amazon ($75.5 billion) generated many times more revenue than BJ's Wholesale Club's $3.4 billion in sales for fiscal Q1.


But BJ's remains a leader in terms of [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-i-in-can-slim-make-sure-top-fund-managers-are-backing-your-stock-picks/). BJ stock has seen seven quarters of rising fund ownership and sports an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/). It also made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-find-stocks-to-watch-amzn-aapl-msft-nvda-nflx/), with nine top funds picking up approximately $35 million worth of shares.


Costco also made the list, with 34 leading funds investing $450 million in the retail giant. Amazon led the list of top new buys, receiving an estimated $4.3 billion from 86 leading money managers.


BJ's Wholesale Prices New All-Time High
---------------------------------------


BJ's Wholesale Club reentered the public markets in June 2018 with a second IPO after going private in 2011.


Based in Massachusetts, BJ's operates membership warehouse clubs in the Eastern U.S. It currently operates 218 clubs and 145 BJ's Gas locations in 17 states. BJ's has 5.5 million members.


Last quarter, the retailer saw earnings growth spike to 165%, up from a 9% decline in the prior report. Over the last three quarters, earnings growth has averaged 53%.


BJ Stock Digests Big Gap-Up
---------------------------


BJ's Wholesale Club has been consolidating its gains after its big jump in May. The stock is trying to show resilience and stave off the [resistance](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/unemployment-claims-1-5-million-amid-new-covid-19-wave-dow-jones-falls/) the market has encountered in recent days.


So far, BJ stock has held up relatively well and remains just below a new high. It appears to be forming a short consolidation showing a potential 38.45 entry. It's in week five of the current pattern, so a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) is possible.


Costco and Walmart have been struggling to find support and rejuvenate their runs. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for both stocks has been lagging. Meanwhile, Amazon stock continues to trade near a new all-time high, with its RS line hitting a new 52-week high.


Keep a close eye on this volatile stock market, and see if BJ stock can finish its consolidation and break out into new-high ground in strong volume. On Friday, BJ stock tried to come off its lows and move into positive territory, but again pulled back to close the week down just under 2%.

After last week's earnings beat, America's largest homebuilder — **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) — may be laying the foundation for a new breakout.

  

As [Barron's reported](http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2015/11/16/tis-the-season-for-home-builders/), KBW analysts Jade Rahmani and Ryan Tomasello noted that "historically, more than 75% of annual homebuilder returns occur from November to January," driven by anticipation of the home selling season that begins in the spring.

  

On Monday, housing market data showed that foreclosure activity rose 3% in Q3 compared to the same period last year. But industry watchers say that the rise is due primarily to the sale of lingering inventory from the housing crisis — not from a rash of new foreclosures.

  

In fact, the website [Consumer Affairs reported](http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/repossessed-homes-jump-66-in-third-quarter-101515.html) that the latest data indicate the housing market is "very close to getting back to normal when it comes to homeowners being able to manage their mortgage payments."

  

Also, the latest National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) sentiment index numbers come out today, followed by housing starts and building permits on Wednesday.

  

And don't forget the elephant in the room for the housing market: a potential Federal Reserve rate hike in December. Higher interest rates could curb homebuyer enthusiasm.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

The homebuilders industry group currently ranks No. 9, up from No. 103 six months ago.

  

Among its industry peers, D.R. Horton's 98 Composite Rating earns the No. 3 slot, behind **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) and **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)). **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **WCI Communities** ([WCIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCIC)) round out the top 5.

  

For its fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30, D.R. Horton posted earnings growth of 33%. Sales increased 28% to $3.09 billion.

  

For fiscal 2016, analysts expect earnings to rise 18%, followed by a 14% rise in fiscal 2017.

  

The company's 89% annual EPS growth rate has attracted the interest of institutional investors, and the number of funds with a position in the stock rose 7% last quarter to 1046.

  

Plus, three typically better-performing mutual funds have a position in the stock, including Fidelity Contrafund and Turner Emerging Growth Investor .

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In January, D.R. Horton undercut the low in a prior chart pattern to reset its base count. Resetting made the cup-with-handle that the stock started forming in April a first-stage consolidation.

  

After breaking out in July, the stock began pulling back to form a new base before rising at least 20%. That makes D.R. Horton's current consolidation part of a first-stage, base-on-base formation.

  

After reporting earnings before the open on Nov. 10, the stock rose over 8% and reclaimed its 50-day line. Volume came in 205% above average, followed the next day by trading 68% higher than normal.

  

The traditional buy point in the base is 33.16, 10 cents above the peak on the left. More aggressive investors could target an earlier 31.57 entry.

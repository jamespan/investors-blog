Today we'll look at **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), located in Foster City, Ca.

  

Gilead is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes medicines for the treatment of life-threatening diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and respiratory conditions.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of lackluster EPS growth, Gilead's earnings skyrocketed 208% in the first quarter.

  

Sales growth also shot higher, coming in at 97%. That marked the company's second consecutive quarter of accelerating gains.

  

Institutions have taken notice, and the number of funds that own Gilead Sciences has been increasing in recent quarters.

  

Also, five typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: American Century All Cap Growth Investment (TWGTX), MFS Growth A ( MFEGX), Janus Twenty T (JAVLX), Franklin Growth A (FKGRX) and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX)

  

However, Gilead's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is currently a weak D+, indicating moderate selling by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

  

That's the result of a sharp sell-off that hit biotech stocks in general, and Gilead in particular, when Congress began questioning the high prices of certain drugs back in March.

  

On a more positive note, Gilead's Up/Down Volume Ratio is a strong 1.7. Anything over 1 indicates demand.

  

The company sports a strong 33% return on equity, helping the it earn an SMR Rating of A.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the Market Smith weekly chart on this page, the stock has done a nice job maintaining the 10-week moving average line as it has continued to ascend. That's a good indication that big investors have been supporting the stock.

  

Back in December, Gilead was working on a late, fourth-stage flat base. The stock was able to break out in mid-January and managed to edge higher over the next several weeks.

  

But then a combination of bad news for the company and a weakening overall market pushed the stock lower.

  

On March 6, the company initiated a recall of 39,000 bottles of "Atripla," which is used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The stock fell almost 4% for the day on heavy volume. And the heavy trading continued the next day as well.

  

The second blow came on March 21 when some House Democrats questioned the high price of certain pharmaceuticals, and asked Gilead to explain the $84,000 a year price tag for its hepatitis C treatment, "Sovaldi."

  

The stock fell close to 5% and volume on that day was 189% above average. The stock continued to retreat in the weeks that followed.

  

After falling below its 40-week moving average line, the stock managed to find a bottom and begin building the right side of its current base.

  

Note how the low in the current pattern undercut the low in the prior flat base. That resets the base count, making the current consolidation a first-stage base.

  

More recently, the stock has been working on the right side of the current base. Trading was tight and steady as that occurred despite the correction in the overall market.

  

Also, Gilead's Relative Strength line was trending generally higher. That's a sign of strength in the face of a weak market.

  

And note how the tight trading in the right side of the base is more controlled than the choppy, erratic trading we saw in the left side of the pattern. That points to institutional accumulation and support.

  

The ideal buy point is 84.98, ten cents above the peak on the left side of the base.

  

On Tuesday, the outlook in the overall market shifted from correction to confirmed uptrend. So watch to see if Gilead Sciences can break past that buy point on volume at least 40-50% above average.

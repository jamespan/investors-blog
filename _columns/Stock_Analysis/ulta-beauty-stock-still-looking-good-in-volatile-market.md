In a rocky, sometimes ugly market, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) has so far remained a relatively good-looking stock.

  

As America's largest retailer of beauty products, Ulta operates 774 stores across 47 states. It also offers haircuts, nail treatments and other salon services.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has been strong and steady, coming in at 21% or higher in seven of the last eight reports.

  

Although earnings growth has slowed somewhat in recent quarters, Ulta beat estimates for both the top and bottom lines when it reported Q4 numbers on Mar. 12. At the time, IBD noted [six reasons Ulta Beauty remains poised for growth](http://news.investors.com/031315-743363-ulta-beauty-stock-jumps.htm).

  

The company is expected to report first-quarter numbers in June.

  

For fiscal 2016, analysts expect earnings to rise 17%, followed by a 19% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

The Illinois-based firm sports a solid 23% return on equity, 40% annual EPS growth rate and a 98 Composite Rating.

  

Institutional investors have taken note, as shown by the A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 2.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio and the nice rise in fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Ulta Beauty was featured in the IBD Stock Analysis on Sep. 19, when it was still working on a base that turned into a cup-with-handle. The stock broke out and continued to edge higher in tight trading with good support along the 10-week line.

  

The IBD Stock Analysis highlighted Ulta again on Jan. 16 as it was forming a flat base, which provided an opportunity to add to your position or establish a new one.

  

The stock broke out the following week and the tight, healthy trading has continued despite more volatile action in the general market.

  

Ulta jumped higher on heavy volume in March after reporting Q4 numbers, then traded in a very tight range for several weeks. That set up another follow-on buying opportunity when the stock cleared a 156.10 entry, calculated by adding 10 cents to the peak on the left.

  

The stock has since pulled back slightly, but volume has been light, a sign that institutional investors have not been selling aggressively.

  

Ulta is now testing its 10-week moving average line, so see if it finds support and continues higher.

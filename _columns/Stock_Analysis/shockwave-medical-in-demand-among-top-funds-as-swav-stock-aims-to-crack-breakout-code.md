Top money managers continue to pour cash into fast-growing **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)). That demand has SWAV stock setting up a new breakout move.




Driving innovations in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, Shockwave Medical sells systems that crack hardened calcium in the arteries. Using its [Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL)](https://shockwavemedical.com/technology/intravascular-lithotripsy-ivl/) technology, it applies sonic pressure waves to address calcifications in the coronary and peripheral arteries.


Shockwave Medical again made IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-pour-money-into-apple-stock-msft-software-stocks-and-semiconductors/), having made this [elite screen](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-bet-billions-on-these-10-stocks-including-microsoft-salesforce-broadcom/) the prior month as well.


Further highlighting strong institutional demand, 63 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD own shares in SWAV stock. Plus, Shockwave Medical sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


Overall, the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) earns a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/?), meaning it is outpacing 96% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). Shockwave Medical was featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/swav-stock-ballooning-sales-profit-send-shockwave-into-an-early-breakout/) on May 12.


Fellow highly rated peers in the medical systems group include **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **IRadimed** ([IRMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRMD)), **Bruker** ([BRKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKR)) and **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)).


Shockwave Medical Rides Growth Wave
-----------------------------------


Over the last three years, Shockwave Medical has generated average annual sales growth of 150%. In Q1, the company delivered revenue of $161.1 million, a 72% year-over-year gain.


Boosted by strong annual pretax profit of 24.7% and a noteworthy 31.8% annual return on equity, the Silicon Valley-based firm boasts an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/). Further showcasing how efficiently the company is run, Shockwave Medical earns high marks in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-shockwave-medical-swav.aspx) for its low debt-to-equity ratio of just 5%.


In terms of earnings growth, the 2019 IPO came into its own in 2021 and 2022. After posting ballooning gains based on year-over-year quarters that showed a loss for parts of both years, Shockwave Medical delivered massive year-over-year quarterly profit gains in Q3 and Q4 of last year.


Continuing that trend, the company posted earnings per share of $1.03 in Q1, marking a 164% advance.


SWAV Stock Clearing The Way For A Breakout
------------------------------------------


Fitting its name, SWAV stock has posted both shockingly powerful surges and wavy, roller-coaster moves since going public in 2019.


Shockwave Medical aims to tap those sonic pressure waves to blast past a 308.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) in a long and deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle).


Several indicators point to resurging technical strength.


The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) has risen sharply, surging past the longer-term 200-day line. Multiple weeks of heavy volume as SWAV stock formed the right side of the [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/) point to solid demand.


Even the lighter-volume down weeks in the [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) are a positive sign. Light trade on the downside shows large investors are holding shares and not selling aggressively.


Given its track record of strong growth and impressive institutional demand, such action is a sign that Shockwave Medical could be on the verge of a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and sustained climb.


On Friday, SWAV stock edged higher to close the week 6% shy of the buy point.

For investors in **Continental Building Products** ([CBPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBPX)), drywall has been anything but dry in recent weeks. After rising 24% in just three weeks from a breakout move on Aug. 3, the maker of wallboard and joint compound materials is crafting a new potential buy zone.




Founded in 1956 as Lafarge Gypsum, Continental Building Products changed its name in 2013 and had its IPO in 2014.


The Virginia-based company serves the residential, commercial and repair and remodel construction markets, primarily in the eastern U.S. and eastern Canada.


Products include its Bison Board drywall and Rapid Coat compound. Its Mold Defense lineup of gypsum board offers enhanced protection against mold, mildew and fire. Mold Defense products were used in the building of the [Gaylord National Resort Hotel and Convention Center](https://www.continental-bp.com/en/about-us/case-studies/gaylord-national-resort-hotel-and-convention-center) in Maryland.

Breakout Stocks To Watch
------------------------


After reporting the big jump in Q2 earnings, Continental Building Products gapped up to a more-than 8% gain on Aug. 3, clearing a 32.85 buy point. The stock continued higher from there in strong volume until peaking at 39.60 on Aug. 21, a 24% gain from its closing price on Aug. 2.


Continental Building Products has managed to hold the bulk of those gains while forming a shallow, second-stage flat base. The new entry price is 39.70.


In early trading Monday, the stock is up over 1% to around 38, leaving it 4% below the buy point. Look for the relative strength line to hit a new 52-week high and for Continental Building Products to break out in [heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) to show conviction for any new run.

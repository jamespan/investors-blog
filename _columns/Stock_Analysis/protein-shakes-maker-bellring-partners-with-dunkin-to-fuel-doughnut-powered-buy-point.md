Ranked No. 1 in the Cosmetics/Personal Care industry, **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) keeps hitting record highs, boosted by the popularity of its lipstick and other beauty products. Meanwhile, industry peer and protein shake provider **BellRing Brands** ([BRBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRBR)) powers a potential breakout — fueled, in part, by glazed doughnuts from Dunkin'.




Rising again Friday, BellRing can now taste a breakout with earnings due Feb. 5. [ELF reports the next day](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-sellers-hit-palantir-stock-growth-concerns/).


BellRing Brands is a leader in the convenient nutrition category. Featuring two primary brands — Dymatize and Premier Protein — the company offers ready-to-drink protein shake and powder protein products. It sells through a diverse network of channels, including club, food, drug, mass, e-commerce, specialty and convenience stores.


In December, BellRing's Dymatize brand announced it has [joined forces with Dunkin' Donuts parent Dunkin Brands](https://bellring.com/news/dymatize-dunkin), the largest coffee and doughnuts brand in the U.S. (In 2020, Inspire Brands, which also owns Buffalo Wild Wings and Arby's, acquired Dunkin'. )


In what the company calls a "drool-worthy innovation," Dunkin' has added BellRing's ISO100 to give Dunkin' glazed doughnuts added flavor.


Dymatize says the collaboration combines the brand's "science-backed, award-winning" ISO100 hydrolyzed whey protein isolate with the taste of a Dunkin' glazed doughnut. Dymatize says the new flavor offers 25 grams of ultrafast absorbing, high-quality protein per serving.


Protein Shakes Power Growth And Investor Demand
-----------------------------------------------


BellRing earns a less-than-ideal 76 [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-bellring-brands-brbr.aspx) — far below the 98 score that [ELF stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-elf-beauty-elf.aspx) earns. But Wall Street appears to have a hankering for protein shakes, as evidenced by strong demand for shares of BRBR stock.


BellRing sports a strong 1.7 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), which tops ELF's 1.4. Plus, 25 funds that earn an A+ rating from IBD own shares. BellRing has now posted four straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Meanwhile, BellRing has generated two straight quarters of earnings acceleration, including a 32% year-over-year spike to 41 cents a share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30). Sales growth has ranged from 18% to 25% over the last four quarters. In fiscal Q4, BellRing posted revenue of $472.6 million.


When the company reports on Feb. 5, analysts forecast 20% EPS growth for fiscal Q1 and 22% for all of fiscal 2024.


BellRing Stock Fuels Continued Climb
------------------------------------


Since coming off a low in September 2022, shares in BellRing ran up as much as 181% before pulling back to form its current base. Along the way, BellRing was [featured in this column on March 24](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/bellring-brands-builds-muscle-to-ring-the-breakout-bell-again/) as it broke out of an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase).


Now, the maker of protein shakes and other nutrition-boosting products looks poised to pump up another breakout. Continuing to find support along its 10-week moving average, BellRing has formed a [second-stage flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) with a 57 buy point.


Up again Friday, BellRing closed just pennies shy a breakout at 56.81.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) remains within striking distance of a 52-week high. While noting that it's risky to buy any stock just before its quarterly numbers are released, see if the Dunkin' partnership and a strong report can boost BellRing into buy range in heavy volume.

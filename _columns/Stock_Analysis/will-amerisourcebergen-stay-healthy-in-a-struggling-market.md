S&P 500 member **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)) primarily distributes generic drugs and specialty pharmaceuticals, generating more than $100 billion in annual revenue.

  

Last year, the Pennsylvania-based firm surprised industry observers when it signed a 10-year distribution deal with Walgreen. The partnership appears to be paying off.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The company has flashed three consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings growth, and revenue has been strong, coming in at 39% in each of the past three reports.

  

But keep an eye on EPS estimates. For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 22%, then slow to 12% in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised downward.

  

AmerisourceBergen sports a healthy 31% return on equity and a solid 98 Composite Rating. It has a C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since coming out of a 17-month slump at the end of 2012, AmerisourceBergen has been a steady climber, moving higher in tight trading and generally finding support along its 10-week line.

  

Earlier this year, the stock reset its base count and broke out of a first-stage cup-without-handle. It has edged higher, and is now working on a base-on-base consolidation.

  

The stock has been consolidating tightly, down only 6% from its July high. That's a positive sign, especially given recent weakness in the general market.

  

The ideal buy point is 79.23, 10 cents above the peak on the left side of the flat base. But keep in mind that the outlook in the Market Pulse is "uptrend under pressure."

  

That means you want to be very picky about making any new buys, since we have seen an increase in institutional selling recently.

The biotech industry group currently ranks No. 3 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks, and Gilead Sciences shares a Best in Group score in Composite Rating with fellow drugmakers Celgene and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)).

  

There's been no shortage of M&A activity in the biotech industry recently, including **Celgene**'s ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) acquisition of Receptos in July and the $8.4 billion buyout of Synageva BioPharma by **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)).

  

As [IBD noted](http://news.investors.com/technology/072915-763973-gild-stock-rises-as-analysts-increase-price-targets.htm) in a July 30 story, a Piper Jaffray analyst said that **Gilead** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) is also expected to make a "transformative transaction."

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Spurred by strong sales of its hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, Gilead posted solid Q2 numbers on July 28 and raised guidance, earning a number of analyst price-target hikes.

  

Gilead pays a dividend yielding 1.5% on an annualized basis and has a five-year EPS growth rate of 37%. Its three-year growth rate is even more impressive, at 91%.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After breaking out in January 2012, Gilead rose over 400% until it pulled back into a 31-week consolidation beginning in October.

  

As it corrected, the stock [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx), since its new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.

  

Gilead broke out in June but soon pulled back to form its current flat base.

  

On the week ended July 31, the stock flashed a [bullish reversal](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/080315-764764-gilead-sciences-sets-up-in-base.htm) on heavy volume — a sign of institutional support.

  

The buy point is 123.47, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

On Thursday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sold off. Gilead also headed lower, slipping below its 50-day line.

  

See if it can find support and get back above that benchmark.

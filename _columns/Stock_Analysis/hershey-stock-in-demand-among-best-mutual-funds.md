Proving that even top money managers have a sweet tooth, **Hershey** ([HSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY)) and **Tootsie Roll Industries** ([TR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TR)) made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-big-on-aapl-stock-as-tech-stock-begin-rebound/). HSY stock and TR stock are both taste=testing new buy zones of their own.




Hershey sports 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) and a market capitalization of roughly $48 billion. It recently dropped off the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), so look for it to make a sweet return. Tootsie Roll has a 92 Composite Rating in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) and a market cap around $2.5 billion.


Earlier this month, Hershey — the confectioner behind treats like Reese's, Kit Kat, Jolly Rancher and Ice Breakers — was certified as a [Great Place to Work](https://www.thehersheycompany.com/content/hershey-corporate/en-us/home/newsroom/press-release/press-release-detail.html?122694). The prestigious award is based entirely on what current employees say about their experience working at the iconic 128-year-old company. Hershey's U.S. business joins operations in Brazil and India in earning this honor.

Hershey Snacks On Rising Sales Growth
-------------------------------------


Headquartered in Hershey, Penn., Hershey is an industry-leading snacks company with an enduring commitment to help children succeed. (The inspiring story of the founder's life and legacy is told in [*Hershey: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams*](https://www.amazon.com/Hershey-Milton-Hersheys-Extraordinary-Utopian/dp/074326410X/ref=asc_df_074326410X/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312165853622&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5324482905863890106&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060629&hvtargid=pla-434636574236&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=60258872297&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312165853622&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5324482905863890106&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060629&hvtargid=pla-434636574236).)


The company has approximately 19,000 employees around the world with over 100 brand names in some 80 countries around the world. Hershey generated more than $8.9 billion in revenue last year.


In Q2, Hershey posted a second straight quarter of double-digit sales growth, delivering a 19% year-over-year increase.


Earnings growth has been solid and steady, ranging from 12% to 32% over the last eight quarters. Over the last three years, Hershey has seen average EPS growth of 13%.


The company sports an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) of A and a [dividend](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/) currently yielding 1.8% on an annualized basis. Hershey was featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day on July 11](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/hershey-stock-eyes-buy-point-as-price-hikes-power-earnings/).


HSY Stock Aims To Sweeten New Buy Zone
--------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) rising toward a new high, HSY stock is sampling a new buy zone.


In both July and this month, Hershey has flashed multiple weeks of tight trading. Last week, the stock planted a Hershey's kiss on a 231.69 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) before retreating. HSY stock is once again flirting with the buy range. It pulled back Friday in light volume.


Look for Hershey to spring higher from the tight trading in strong volume, and see if its RS line can hit a new 52-week high.


Meanwhile. Tootsie Roll Industries is testing a 36.18 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).

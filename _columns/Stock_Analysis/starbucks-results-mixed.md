Investors like to see high-voltage, espresso quarterly reports, but on Thursday **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) delivered what some might view as more like a cup of decaf.


The coffee giant's fiscal Q1 revenue fell short of analyst estimates, and guidance for Q2 was also below forecasts.


But CEO Howard Schultz and his management team remain "very bullish" on percolating growth in China, and with the increasing popularity of the Mobile Order & Pay app, which lets customers skip the lines by ordering ahead of time on their **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and smartphones that run on **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))-owned Google's Android platform.


**Starbucks Results**


While the Seattle-based firm missed on revenue with a 12% rise, its earnings-per-share of 46 cents topped analyst calls for 44 to 45 cents. That marked a year-over-year quarterly increase of 15%. Another strong point was 9% same-store sales growth in the Americas.


Weakness in the Chinese economy has weighed heavily on stocks, and Starbucks saw a slowdown in same-store sales growth in China, to 5%.


But the java king is sticking to its plan to open 500 new stores in the country this year, with the goal of having 3,400 locations in China by 2019.


**Starbucks' Next Big Test**


Like fellow market leaders **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Starbucks has tested its 40-week moving average in recent weeks.


On Friday, it closed decisively above that line and near the top of the week's price range, showing the highest weekly volume since August.


The next key testing ground for Starbucks is the 10-week line, which has acted like a ceiling of resistance since last month. See if the stock can reclaim that benchmark and convert it back into a floor of support.

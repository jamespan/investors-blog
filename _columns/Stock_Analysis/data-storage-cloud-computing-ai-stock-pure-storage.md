In our increasingly always-connected world, the rapid rise of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) is driving demand for data storage stocks like **Smart Global Holdings** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)), **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)) and **Carbonite** ([CARB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARB)). [IPO Leaders member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) also makes that list.




Based in Silicon Valley, Pure Storage delivers what it calls "radically simple, all-flash enterprise storage technology." The company also claims to be "one of the fastest growing enterprise IT companies in history."


The company, which had its IPO in 2015, allows [cloud service providers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies to quickly adopt next-generation technologies, such as [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/).


According to [Gartner Peer Insights](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/solid-state-arrays/vendor/pure-storage-inc/alternatives), Pure Storage often competes for clients with NetApp, **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)), **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** ([HPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPE)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)).


Pure Storage customers include **Shutterfly** ([SFLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFLY)), which [soared on Q1 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shutterfly-stock-quarterly-earnings-news/), as well as **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and the San Francisco Giants baseball team.

Leading Data Storage Stock
--------------------------


With a 95 Composite Rating, Pure Storage holds the No. 4 spot within the No. 8-ranked data storage industry group.


Smart Global, Carbonite, **Qualstar** ([QBAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QBAK)) and Micron Technology round out the top five stocks.


For Q1 fiscal 2018 (ended Jan. 31), Pure Storage reported a 750% spike in earnings growth. The percentage gain was based on comparisons to a prior-year quarter that showed a loss.


Revenue grew 48%, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth.


Pure Storage is scheduled to report second-quarter numbers on May 21, with analysts expecting a 14% rise in earnings.


The stock is showing mixed signs of institutional demand. The up/down volume ratio is a lackluster (but rising) 0.7, while a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and three quarters of rising fund ownership point to interest among mutual fund managers.


Testing New Buy Zone
--------------------


After successfully testing support at its 50-day line last week, Pure Storage is now testing a 21.43 buy point. In early trading Monday, the stock is up over 4%, pushing it into the 21.43 to 22.50 buy zone.


In a sign of renewed technical strength, the shorter-term 10-day moving average has moved back above the longer-term 50-day moving average. The relative strength line is within striking distance of new-high ground.



Industry peers Micron Technology and Smart Global have come under selling pressure recently that pushed them below their 10-week lines. But Smart Global has retaken that benchmark early Monday with a 4.5% gain. Micron remains 6% below its 10-week moving average.


Carbonite closed last week 4% below a 33.65 entry in a later-stage cup base. The stock is down around 1% on Monday. NetApp has continued to show strength and is over 50% above the buy point it cleared last November.

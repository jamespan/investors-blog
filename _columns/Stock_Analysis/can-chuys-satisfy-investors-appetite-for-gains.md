Today we're going to look at **Chuy's Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)), a restaurant chain that's been scoring some solid growth.

  

The eatery started with one restaurant in Austin, Texas in 1982 and today has 40. And they've have been expanding their offbeat restaurants into other states.

  

Each Chuy's restaurant is unique and eclectic. And, as an April 3 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/040213-650058-chuys-tex-mex-restaurant-beyond-texas.htm) noted, when you walk into a Chuy's you'll find things like an Elvis shrine, vintage hubcaps nailed to the wall or a red fish hanging from the ceiling.

  

It also has a bigger bar and more alcohol sales as a percentage of overall sales that most other restaurants. 

  

And analysts say that type of open atmosphere is appealing to all ages.

  

The chain offers Tex-Mex and some traditional items, but with a Chuy's flair like their own handmade sauces and fresh beef and chicken items — there are no freezers in the restaurants. 

  

And 46 of the 49 items on their menu are less than $10 each. 

  

Analysts say customers like that combination of high-quality food at a good price. 

  

Customers can get in an out for lunch in 30 minutes — which you don't find at most sit-down restaurants. 

  

That efficiency might also contribute to their average sales per restaurant, which have been $5 million a year. Analysts say that's roughly double most other casual restaurants. 

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Those gains are reflected in Chuy's fundamentals. Sales growth ranged from 28% to 40% the past five quarters. 

  

• Earnings growth has rebounded after a slowdown a few years back.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts see earnings rising 143% this year and 22% next year. 

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-chuys-holdings-inc-chuy.aspx) shows Chuy's 98 Composite Rating ties it with **AFC Enterprises** ([AFCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFCE)) and **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) for the No. 3 slot in the Retail-Restaurants industry group.

  

**Krispy Kreme Doughnuts** ([KKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKD)) and **Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) have higher ratings, but their sales growth hasn't been as strong as Chuy's.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 28 among IBD's 197 groups, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Chuy's came public last July, then formed a base pattern.

  

It broke out in late Jan. climbed a little, then paused and briefly pulled back to the 50-day line, where it found support and resumed its rise.

  

The stock is now too far extended to get into safely. But given the firm's strong growth, it may be one to keep an eye on.

  

Still, keep in mind the stock only trades about 250,000 shares a day on average, so it's on the thin side and that makes it more vulnerable to big price swings. But it's also a young stock, so watch to see if volume increases.

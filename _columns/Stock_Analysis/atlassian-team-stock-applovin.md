One of the [best stocks of 2024](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-2024-palantir-applovin-alab-cava/), **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) [has fallen sharply](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applovin-stock-plunges-short-seller-reports/) on two negative reports, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) in steep decline. But the stock of industry peer **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) briefly raced back into buy range on the heels of strong demand from top investors and a new partnership with Formula One icon Williams Racing. A [sharp drop on the Nasdaq](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-nasdaq-sp500-djia-nvidia-snowflake-mastercard-embraer/), however, had Atlassian skidding out of the buy zone.


After retreating from the 52-week high it notched this month, [Atlassian stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-atlassian-cl-a-team.aspx) bounced off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on Tuesday on the way to retaking its 287.97 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). While current market conditions have thrown a wrench into the stock's renewed breakout, multiple signs of strength and demand have put Atlassian as a member of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).




Atlassian Teams Up With Williams Racing
---------------------------------------


Earlier this month, Atlassian joined forces with the F1 powerhouse to create [Atlassian Williams Racing](https://investors.atlassian.com/news/news-details/2025/Williams-and-Atlassian-Announce-Title-Partnership-to-Form-Atlassian-Williams-Racing/default.aspx). In the press release announcing the deal, Atlassian noted it was a collaboration of two companies driven by teamwork.


Tapping the power of [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-news/), Atlassian provides collaboration software to help teams organize, discuss and complete shared work. Its clientele spans small businesses to large enterprises, including the majority of the Fortune 500.


Viewing racing as an ultimate test of teamwork, Williams has been competing in F1 for nearly 50 years.


Under the partnership, Atlassian becomes the Official Title Partner, Official Technology Partner and Official Collaboration Software Partner. It marks the biggest partnership deal in Williams' history.


Revved Up By Big Demand
-----------------------


While sporting a highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-atlassian-cl-a-team.aspx) — and a spot an [elite screen](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-screener-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) alongside **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) — Atlassian has flashed clear signs of demand.


In addition to three quarters of rising fund ownership, Atlassian earns a A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), indicating heavy institutional buying over the last 13 weeks.


Plus, Atlassian stock made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-axon-applovin-tesla-meta-google/), alongside industry peers **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **Karooooo** ([KARO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KARO)). AppLovin also made this monthly screen, although it has subsequently run into selling pressure, dropping sharply below its 10-week line.


Atlassian, AppLovin and its other peers hail from the specialty enterprise software group, which ranks a strong No. 12 out of the 197 industries tracked by Investor's Business Daily.


Growth Formula Drives Atlassian Stock
-------------------------------------


Strong and steady double-digit growth underlies demand for Atlassian.


In the fourth quarter, the AI-fueled company notched over $1.26 billion in revenue, marking a 21% year-over-year increase. Earnings growth rose 32% to 96 cents per share. For the full year, analysts forecast 19% earnings growth to $3.48 a share, followed by a 22% rise to $4.23 in 2026.


Following its fourth-quarter report, Atlassian stock gapped up in huge volume, clearing a 287.97 buy point in an early-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). But a spat of down days followed.


Sour market action has taken its toll on Atlassian, dragging it below the buy zone. But the stock had a strong finish to end the week, bouncing off its 50-day line for a 2% gain. Industry peer AppLovin, however, remains below that benchmark moving average.

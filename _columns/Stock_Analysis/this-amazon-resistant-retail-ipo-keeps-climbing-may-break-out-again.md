In February 2016, the IBD Stock Analysis asked if new IPO **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) would prove to be a [long-term bargain for investors](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/020416-792065-ipo-watch-will-ollies-prove-a-long-term-bargain-for-investors.aspx). After a 103% run, it turns out the answer was yes.









 
 
 From apparel retailers like **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) and **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) to grocery store chain **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has put the fear of Jeff Bezos into many players across the retail sector.
But Ollie's, which operates 257 self-described "semi-lovely" discount stores, has proved to be resilient to the Amazon onslaught, and has continued to post strong and steady top and bottom line growth.


No. 1 Ranked Discount Retailer
------------------------------


Founded in Pennsylvania in 1982, Ollie's Bargain Outlet has a simple mission to sell "Good Stuff Cheap," with a focus on closeouts, excess inventory and salvage merchandise.


It's been a profitable niche for the July 2015 IPO. Ollie's has generated a 41% three-year annual EPS growth rate, and sales have increased at a 19% pace over the same period.


Revenue and earnings growth have both risen in each of the last two quarters.


Although Ollie's Bargain Outlet didn't make IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/apple-celgene-boeing-unitedhealth-mutual-funds-new-buys/),Â it has shown signs of institutional demand, including seven consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership and a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


With the highest possible 99 Composite Rating, Ollie's holds the No. 1 ranking within the Retail-Discount & Variety industry group, ahead of **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).


The group ranks No. 56 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, up from No. 176 six months ago.


Later-Stage Bargain Breakout?
-----------------------------


When Ollie's was first featured in the IBD Stock Analysis on Feb. 4, 2016, it was forming its first [post-IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/), which ended up becoming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 23.09 entry.


Ollie's broke out a month later, launching a 103% climb before reaching an all-time high of 46.08 last month.


The stock is now working on a six-week flat base with a 46.18 buy point. Note that it's a third-stage pattern, and such later-stage formations can be risky.



But Ollie's has continued to show support at its 10-week moving average, and its relative strength line remains near new high ground.


On Tuesday, the stock rose just under 2% in light volume to close at 45.90. Ollie's was down fractionally in early trading Wednesday.


Meanwhile, Amazon continues to work on a new base and was poking its head back above its 50-day line Wednesday.


Look for Ollie's Bargain Outlet to clear the 46.18 buy point in heavy volume, but be sure to [follow sound sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) if the breakout fails to generate a sustained climb.

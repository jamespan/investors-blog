With a 103% spike in earnings last quarter, auto retailer **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) is among the best growth stocks to watch. Plus, the stock is now revving up its engines as it targets a new buy point.




Lithia Motors sports a strong 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), meaning it's outpacing 98% of all stocks in terms of key [fundamental and technical factors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). It shares top billing in the [automotive retail group](https://www.investors.com/news/automotive-industry-news-self-driving-cars-and-stocks-to-watch/) with **America's Car-Mart** ([CRMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRMT)) and **Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)). The industry ranks No. 11 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


A look at the monthly stock chart shows the phenomenal run Lithia Motors made since the start of the huge bull market in early 2009. Since bottoming out in April 2009, Lithia Motors stock gained as much as 15,468% through October 2020.


Such gains for Lithia Motors even eclipse those of more widely known growth stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). From its low in January 2009 through October 2020, Apple rose 4,847%. Microsoft gained "just" 1,460% from a low in March 2009 through October 2020.


Growth Stocks To Watch: Lithia Motors Among New Buys By Top Funds
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Lithia Motors joins Apple and Microsoft on the latest lists of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/fang-stocks-best-mutual-funds-buy-amazon-google-parent-alphabet-facebook/). Plus, 56 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Lithia Motors.


Strong recent and projected earnings growth is one reason for the strong institutional sponsorship of Lithia Motors. In Q3, the company reported a 103% spike in EPS growth. For Q4, analysts see earnings rising 65%. For the full year, consensus analyst estimates call for a 48% increase.


In terms of revenue growth, Lithia Motors saw a rebound to a 9% increase in Q3 after two quarters of declining sales growth.


Selling vehicles across a wide network of dealership brands, the company has over 15,000 employees. Lithia Motors is among the top growth stocks and fastest-growing companies in the Fortune 500.


Second Chances: Lithia Motors Accelerates Toward New Buy Point
--------------------------------------------------------------


Lithia Motors broke out on Oct. 5 in strong volume. But it soon pulled back, ultimately dropping as much as 19% below the 278.24 buy point. That decline invalidates the initial entry, meaning the stock needs to form a new base.


The stock has now done that, establishing a new potential buy point at 288.66. While forming this new [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), the stock has recaptured its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/), with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) trending higher to show stock market leadership.


On Thursday, Lithia Motors rose nearly 3%. It managed to stay positive Friday, giving it a weekly gain of nearly 6%. Look for volume to come in 40% or higher above average on the day of any breakout attempt.

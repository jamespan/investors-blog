To gauge the quality of a stock, it can help to see the company it keeps. **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) stock shares the spotlight on the highly selective [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) screen with artificial intelligence powerhouses like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)).


Like [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-january-2025/), [ServiceNow](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/servicenow-stock-now-stock-mcdermott-interview-artificial-intelligence/) and [Palantir](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/), HubSpot earns the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-hubspot-hubs.aspx). Further, as the cloud-based sales and marketing firm sets up a potential breakout, here are four reasons it ranks among the best [AI stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/).




1. Strong And Steady Earnings Growth
------------------------------------


Based in Cambridge, Mass., HubSpot provides an AI-powered platform serving more than 238,000 customers across 14 global offices. Its cloud-based technology serves clients across an integrated ecosystem of hubs targeting marketing, sales, commerce, operations and customer service operations.


On Jan. 6, HubSpot announced it had completed its previously announced [acquisition of Frame AI](https://ir.hubspot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hubspot-completes-acquisition-ai-powered-conversation), an AI-powered conversation intelligence platform.


Over the last three years, HubSpot has generated average annual earnings growth of 77%. Over the last three quarters, it has posted average per-share earnings gains of 37.6%. In the third quarter, the company delivered a 35% year-over-year gain to $2.18 per share.


Sales rose 20% to $669.7 million. Set to report next on Feb. 12, analysts forecast sales of $673.6 million, which would mark a 16% rise over the prior-year quarter.


Earnings estimates call for a 25% increase to $2.19 per share. For the full year, Wall Street also expects a 28% gain to $8 a share.


2. HubSpot Stock In Clear Demand
--------------------------------


Recovering from a sharp drop below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) in July, HubSpot shows signs of demand as it builds a new base.


In addition to an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), 122 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares of HubSpot stock.


While Nvidia tries to get back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and Palantir builds on its rebound above that benchmark, HubSpot is now testing support at that line.


3. HubSpot Hails From Highly Ranked Industry
--------------------------------------------


Alongside highly rated industry peers **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **AppFolio** ([APPF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPF)), HubSpot stock hails from the specialty enterprise software group.


The group ranks No. 15 among the 197 industries IBD tracks. That's a positive for HubSpot since winning stocks tend to come from the [top-ranked industry groups](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


In another sign of the quality company the stock keeps, HubSpot earns a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) alongside Palantir and ServiceNow, both of which come from the No. 14-ranked enterprise software group.


4. HubSpot Stock Near Breakout After Flashing Telltale Sign
-----------------------------------------------------------


As the Nasdaq bounces back above its 50-day line and retakes its 21-day line, HubSpot stock continues to work on a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/base-on-base-chart-pattern-turns-a-disappointment-into-a-success/).



The telltale clue for this formation is how HubSpot recently [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/), making this new setup an early-stage pattern. Such formations have a higher likelihood of success than late-stage patterns, such as Nvidia's latest breakout.


HubSpot refreshed its base count in May by undercutting the low in its prior pattern. After a short rise from the new first-stage base in November, the stock pulled back to start forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) as part of this new base-on-base formation. The current target buy point is 762.47.


Note how trading has tightened up in recent weeks. That could mean the stock coiling up to spring higher and launch a new breakout.

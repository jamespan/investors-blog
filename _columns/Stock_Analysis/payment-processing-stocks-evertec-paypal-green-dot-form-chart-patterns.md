With the market back in an uptrend, Puerto Rico-based payment-processing leader **Evertec** ([EVTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVTC)) is trying to tap into a new buy zone. Fellow payment processing stocks **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)) are also setting up.




Green Dot, PayPal and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) share the No. 1 ranking among payment processors with a 97 Composite Rating. Evertec comes in at No. 5 with a 94 Composite Rating, which means it's [outperforming 94% of all stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The group, which also includesÂ **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), ranks No. 69 among 197 groups.


Evertec was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/evertec-stock-evertech-earnings-payment-stocks/).

Payment Processing And Profit Margins
-------------------------------------


The payment processing business can be highly profitable, as indicated by the annual pretax profit margins of the industry leaders. Evertec sports a 33% profit margin, topping both PayPal (23%) and Green Dot (20%). But the margins for both Visa (65%) and Mastercard (54%) dwarf those of their peers.


Evertec also has a stellar 86% return on equity. But its 387% debt-to-equity ratio could spell trouble if interest rates rise significantly, increasing the cost of servicing that debt.


The company has a presence in 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, processing approximately 2 billion transactions per year. It owns and operates one of the leading personal identification number (PIN) debit networks in Latin America.


Evertec has posted three quarters of rising earnings growth, increasing from a 44% *decline* in Q4 of 2017 to a 36% spike in Q3 of last year. Analysts are looking for that to continue with an 83% gain in Q4. Evertec is expected to report in February.


Signs of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) include a 1.4 up/down volume ratio, a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and three quarters of rising fund ownership. Although Evertec didn't make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-reit-stocks-medical-stocks/), 67 funds with an A- or higher rating own shares.


New Breakout After 66% Run?
---------------------------


Last April, Evertec broke out to launch a 66% gain over the next seven months, consistently finding support at its 10-week line along the way.


Technically, the stock [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) in late October when it just barely undercut the low in its prior pattern, making its current consolidation a first-stage base. But it only undercut the prior low by two cents. Such a minor pullback is not the type of wipe-the-slate-clean reset you look for to launch a fresh climb.


But Evertec is showing technical strength as it tests a 29.80 buy point with its RS line hitting a new 52-week high.


See if the new market uptrend can continue to gain traction, and if Evertec can decisively clear the entry in volume at least 40% above average.


On Monday, the stock rose 2.8% to 28.99, putting it 2% below the buy point. Volume was 84% above average.


In early trading Tuesday, the stock was up 3% to lift it into the 29.80 to 31.29 buy zone. Volume is again trending higher than normal.



PayPal stock is up 2% to 88.59, bringing it within 5% of a 93.80 buy point. Green Dot continues test support at its 50-day moving average and has edged back above it. Visa has also recaptured that benchmark line.

While **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) offers wings, widescreen TVs for watching sports and a wide range of beer and cocktails, **Dave & Buster’s Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) bumps it up a level with its “eatertainment” concept, featuring a restaurant, sports bar and high-tech arcade all under one roof.


It Pays To Play
---------------


Games are serious business for Dave & Buster’s, with its arcade and other amusement-related offerings making up 53% of its $747 million in fiscal 2015 revenue.


Amusement is also quite profitable. Dave & Buster’s has a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 95%, trumping Buffalo Wild Wings’ 21% pace. Last quarter, the Dallas-based company also outperformed its Minneapolis rival with a 51% rise in earnings versus a 23% gain for B-Dubs.


Dave & Buster’s, which operates 81 locations, also has the edge in comparable-store sales growth, with a 6% increase last quarter. While Buffalo Wild Wings is much larger with 1,080 restaurants, its comps for company-owned restaurants slowed to just 1.9% in Q4.


Dave & Buster’s is boosting amusement revenue with the launch of mobile versions of its games, as well as the Power Card, which eliminates the need for game tokens and has increased spending in the arcades.


When announcing earnings on March 29, Dave & Buster’s forecast revenue of $967 million to $987 million for fiscal 2016, which ends in January, well above consensus estimates of $862.2 million.


After Tilting, New Base Forms

The stock then entered a choppy period, but established a new low in February and began to climb higher, flashing a string of tight weekly closes along the way.


Look for the 10-week moving average to get back above the 40-week line as Dave & Buster’s tries to close in on a 43.16 entry.

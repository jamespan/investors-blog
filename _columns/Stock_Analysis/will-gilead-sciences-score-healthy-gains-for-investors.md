**Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) is a California-based pharmaceutical company.

  

Its product line includes the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which was introduced in Dec. and has a better cure rate than the competition.

  

This week Gilead was featured in [IBD'S Sector Leaders Review](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/093014-719593-is-gilead-stock-a-buy.htm) which mentioned that the company has a lot going for it, but that its hepatitis C drug may soon face competition from companies like **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK))and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) .

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The company had explosive earnings growth in the first and second quarters of 2014, coming in respectively at 208% and 372%.

  

Sales climbed 97% in the first quarter and 136% in the second quarter.

  

Analysts expect 2014 will go well for Gilead and see profits rising 294%. But they also predict earnings growth will ease to just 18% next year, which is under the 25% you'd like to see.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith chart on this page shows that Gilead has more than tripled in price during the past two years.

  

The low in the cup-with-handle base it formed last spring was deep enough to undercut the low in the prior base and shake out some investors. That undercut makes it a first-stage base.

  

The stock broke out of that pattern and rose at a faster rate than the overall market. You can see that action in the Relative Strength Line, which compares the stock's price action to the S&P 500.

  

Gilead's climb stopped in September when it pulled back to find support at the 10-week line.

  

Since then it's been forming a new consolidation, which so far is looking like a flat base.

  

But the stock is also facing a headwind since the general market is now in a correction.

  

Gilead is in a leading industry group. The Biomed/Biotech group is ranked No. 4 among IBD's 197 groups, based on the group's six-month price performance.

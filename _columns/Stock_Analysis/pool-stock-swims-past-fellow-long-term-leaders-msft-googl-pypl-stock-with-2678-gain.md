As the economy reopens, leisure sector leader **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) is trying to make a splash with a new breakout and all-time high. Pool stock swam right past fellow [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), with a 2,678% gain since the start of a new bull market in March 2009.




Since the bull market rebound began in March 2009 through the most recent peak, Pool's move has been like a tsunami, swamping the moves by Microsoft (1,667%) and Alphabet (1,597%). PYPL stock, which had its IPO in July 2015, has risen "just" 754% since its debut.


Pool stock and GOOGL sport the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). The score means they are outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). PayPal and Microsoft trail with ratings of 91and 88, respectively.

Pool Stock Joins In The Reopening Fun
-------------------------------------


While the pandemic has been no picnic for many industries, Covid-19 trends have breathed fresh air into the leisure sector. Play-at-home trends during the pandemic and the subsequent easing or elimination of restrictions on outdoor activities have both given a boost to the leisure products industry group, which ranks No. 8 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


**Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)) and **Hayward** ([HAYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAYW)) join Pool stock in sporting a 99 Composite Rating.


Pool reported 227% earnings growth and 57% sales growth last quarter. Analysts expect things to keep going swimmingly in Pool's current fiscal quarter with a 48% EPS gain. Analysts forecast 47% growth for the current fiscal year.


Top money managers also like what they see. Pool stock has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership, and 68 top [mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-big-on-semiconductor-finance-machinery-transportation-sectors/) with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in the Louisiana-based company.

--------------------------------------------------


As Alphabet, Microsoft and PayPal stocks approach or test new [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), Pool stock is wading just below a 449.54 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


On April 22, Pool stock gapped up to new highs in a more-than-6% gain after reporting 227% quarterly earnings growth. Since then, the stock has held the majority of those gains as it sets up its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/).


Already above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/), Pool has been trading right along its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is within striking distance of a new high as Pool stock tries to complete its base and break out.


At the close Friday, Pool stock rose nicely in good volume to close with more than a 2% gain for the week.

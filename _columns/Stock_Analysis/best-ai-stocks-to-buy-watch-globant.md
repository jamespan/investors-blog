Highly Rated Tech Services, AI Stock
------------------------------------


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), Globant holds the No. 2 ranking among tech services stocks, just behind [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Epam** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), which has a 98 rating. The group ranks No. 39 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Globant's revenue growth has been solid and steady, ranging from 21% to 35% over the last five quarters. EPS gains have accelerated over the last three reports, coming in at 52% in Q1. Globant is set to report Q2 earnings after today's market close. Analysts expect a 44% increase in earnings per share.


Although its D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating is less than ideal, the stock does sport a 1.8 up/down volume ratio. Globant has also posted two quarters of rising fund ownership. Fifty-two funds with an A- or better rating own the stock.


AI Stock Breakout Or Bust?
--------------------------


With earnings due after the close, Globant is finding support at its 50-day line while building an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The buy point is 60.07.


In early trading Thursday, the stock is up over 1% in volume trending well above average, putting it 4% below the entry. See if Globant's Q2 earnings report can push the stock past the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal. And look for the relative strength line to perk up and hit a new 52-week high.

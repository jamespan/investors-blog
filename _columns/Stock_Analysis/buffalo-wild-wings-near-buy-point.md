**Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) runs more than 1,000 casual restaurants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, combining big screen TVs, sports and beer with Buffalo, N.Y.-style chicken wings.


Last year, it bought a stake in PizzaRev, a Los Angeles artisan pizza eatery as part of Buffalo Wild Wings' plan to grow by investing in restaurants it can franchise nationally.


**Key Fundamentals**


First-quarter earnings growth accelerated to 71% from 24%; sales growth jumped to 21%. For the full year, analysts expect profit to rise 34%, followed by a 17% gain in 2015.


Buffalo Wild Wings has a solid 17% return on equity and a 95 Composite Rating.


Institutional investors have taken note. The stock has a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating as the number of funds holding shares has risen the past two quarters.


**Chart Analysis**


After basing for more than a year, Buffalo Wild Wings broke out in April 2013, rising 58% in just 30 weeks.


It then hit resistance and began a new price consolidation. After a short-lived breakout attempt in March, it quickly pulled back.


The stock found support at the 40-week moving average line and showed a bullish reversal during the week ended May 2 on strong Q1 earnings. Weekly volume was 94% above average.


In the right side of its cup base, Buffalo Wild Wings recaptured the 10-week line and has been closing near the top of its weekly price ranges. Volume rose last week as the stock closed in on its 159.91 buy point.


Note this is a third-stage pattern, which can be riskier than earlier-stage bases.

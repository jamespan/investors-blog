After retreating while a bear market hit at the end of last year, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is now trying to retake an earlier buy point. In advance of its upcoming earnings report, the yoga clothing retailer recently [raised its net revenue and EPS guidance](http://investor.lululemon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lululemon-athletica-inc-updates-guidance-fourth-quarter-fiscal-5) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, ended Feb. 3.




The Vancouver, British Columbia-based company now expects net revenue to come in between $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, compared to earlier forecasts of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion. Lululemon also raised its diluted EPS guidance to $1.72 to $1.74, up from $1.64 to $1.67.


Founded in 1998, Lululemon started as a design studio by day and yoga studio by night, becoming a stand-alone store in November 2000. Today, the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has over 425 yoga apparel retail locations around the world, and generated $747.7 million in revenue in fiscal 2018 Q3, which closed on Oct. 28.

No. 1-Ranking Among Apparel Retail Stocks
-----------------------------------------


Since the apparel and accessories retailers industry ranks a lowly No. 149 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks, Lululemon stock does not qualify as one of the [top-rated stocks in the top-ranked industries](https://www.investors.com/videos/how-to-find-the-top-rated-stocks-in-the-top-ranked-industries/). But with a 94 Composite Rating, it earns top billing among its peers. The 94 rating also means Lululemon is [outperforming 94% of all stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) on the market in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Earnings growth has ranged from 33% to 82% over the last four quarters, while revenue gains have come in between 18% and 25% during the same period. The company has not yet announced the date of its next earnings report, which is expected some time this month.


Lululemon also sports an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks the key ingredients that drive long-term earnings growth — sales, profit margins and return on equity (ROE) — as a whole. The company's ROE stands at 24%, well above the 17% minimum you look for, while it also sports a solid 19% annual pretax profit margin.


In a world where interest rates could be set to rise in coming years, it's also positive to see that Lululemon has a 0% debt-to-equity ratio.


Lululemon stock has shown signs of institutional demand, including a 1.8 up/down volume ratio and seven quarters of rising fund ownership.


Lululemon Stock Tests New Breakout
----------------------------------


From the low of 47.26 it hit on May 31, 2017 to the all-time high of 164.79 it reached on Oct. 1, 2018, Lululemon stock gained 249%. It then pulled back to form a cup with handle, declining 33% within the base.


The stock found a bottom and started to climb just before a new market uptrend took hold starting on Jan. 4. It went on to form a handle offering a 152.91 entry. (There was another plausible entry at 152.28.) The yoga and athletic apparel leader cleared that buy point on Feb. 12 in volume 41% above average.


But the stock soon slipped back below the entry and has failed to close above it since Valentine's Day. Volume lightened up significantly, indicating that large investors are not selling aggressively. But Friday's action may mean that's changing.


On Friday, the stock fell 3.5 2% in rising and above-average volume, putting it 7% below the entry. Lululemon, however, has not fallen enough to trigger the [7%-8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) and is trying to hold [support at its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


See if Lululemon stock can decisively retake the buy point, preferably in volume at least 40% above average, to show conviction for any new breakout attempt.

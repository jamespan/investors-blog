 While **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) has mirrored the same downward trajectory that **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) initially followed after it went public in 2012, fellow 2017 IPO **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) has had a stronger debut and could be laying the foundation for a new run.
The operator of over 70 big-box flooring and furniture stores in 17 states may be dwarfed by rivals **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), but Floor & Decor outranks both of its larger rival retailers.


No. 1 Rank In Group
-------------------


Unlike Snap, which is not profitable, Floor & Decor has been generating explosive earnings growth.


In Q1, EPS gains jumped from 64% to 75%, bringing the company's average earnings growth over the last three reports to 96%. Floor & Decor's three-year average annual EPS growth stands at 67%.


Analysts expect second-quarter earnings-per-share to spike to 260%.


For 2017, analysts are looking for a year-over-year gain of 24%, followed by a 26% gain in 2018. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Revenue growth has also been impressive, with a 31% gain in Q1, and a three-year average annual sales growth rate of 35%.


Floor & Decor's track record has earned it a spot on the [IBD 50 list of top growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/), a 94 Composite Rating and the No. 1 rank within the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products industry group.


Home Depot holds the No. 3 slot with an 82 Composite Rating, while Lowe's comes in at No. 5 with a score of 66.


Designing New Base
------------------


Floor & Decor has been moving nicely higher since its Apr. 27 initial public offering.


The stock has flashed multiple up and down days with wide price swings in either direction. But looking at the weekly chart helps put that daily volatility in a longer-term context, making it easier to track the underlying trend.



The Georgia-based company is now working on a new chart pattern with a 43.20 entry.


The stock has not been trading long enough to calculate an Accumulation/Distribution Rating, but it does sport a 4.1 Up/Down Volume Ratio, indicating demand for shares.


Floor & Decor has also established a decent level of liquidity, trading an average of just under 600,000 shares a day with an average daily dollar volume of around $24 million.


Ont Thursday, Floor & Decor closed fractionally lower after coming off its lows for the day to close in the upper half of the price range and right around its 10-day moving average.


Look for the general market to shake off recent selling pressure and for Floor & Decor to clear the buy point in convincing volume.


Also keep in mind that IPO stocks can be volatile, so be sure to follow defensive sell rules if the stock breaks out, then retreats.

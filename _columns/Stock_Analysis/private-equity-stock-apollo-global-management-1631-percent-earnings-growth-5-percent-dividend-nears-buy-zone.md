 A week after being featured in the [March 21 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/stock-with-1534-earnings-growth-and-6-dividend-nears-breakout/), **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) entered a new buy zone. Now the New York-based private-equity firm is trying to break out again.
Along with chip stock **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) and Chinese internet play **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), Apollo made IBD's list of [potential breakout stocks expecting 50%-plus growth](https://www.investors.com/research/q1-earnings-preview-potential-breakout-stocks-expecting-50-plus-growth/), published as Q1 earnings season kicked in.


Weibo, Cirrus and others on the list followed Apollo's lead and went on to deliver breakouts and post solid first-quarter numbers. **TTM Technologies** ([TTMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTMI)), which also made the list, broke out on Thursday, but pulled back in recent days as leading stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and the major indexes sold off.


Top Fund Managers Buying Shares
-------------------------------


Six mutual funds with an A+ performance rating have a position in Apollo, and it's not hard to see what's attracting these top fund managers.


Apollo has posted 1,631% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, although the Q1 profit comparison came against a year-ago loss. It sports a 54% pretax profit margin and 54% return on equity.


Sales growth has accelerated in recent quarters, from 88% in Q2 2016 to 433% in Q1. The stock also pays a dividend yielding 5.2% on an annualized basis.


Strong demand is reflected in an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.6 up/down volume ratio and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


As self-described "contrarian, value-oriented investors in private equity, credit and real estate," Apollo Global Management is No.1-rated among investment management stocks. **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), **Diamond Hill Investment Group** ([DHIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHIL)), **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and **Eaton Vance** ([EV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EV)) round out the top five.


Support For Another Breakout Move?
----------------------------------


Apollo Global Management has been moving higher since the end of last year, finding support at the 10-week line along the way.


On Thursday, the stock poked its head past a 27.88 buy point in a flat base that's part of a larger base-on-base formation. Volume was just average, but higher than the day before, and the relative strength line moved into new high ground.


Friday's market sell-off made it hard for any stock to advance, and Apollo Global Management felt the pressure. It ended last week below the buy point, but found support at its 10-day line and volume was below average - a sign that, at least for now, large investors are not selling aggressively.


On Monday, the stock dipped during the day, but once again found support at the 10-day line to close under 2% from the buy point.


See if the market rebounds and Apollo can retake the buy point in heavy volume.

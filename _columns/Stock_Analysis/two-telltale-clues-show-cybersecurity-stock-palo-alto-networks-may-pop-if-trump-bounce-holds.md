After falling below key support lines in recent weeks, cybersecurity stocks like **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)), **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) are showing signs of a rebound. Meanwhile, fellow security software provider and 2015 IPO **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) climbed around 17% for the week.


Now next-generation firewall provider **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is trying to enter a new buy zone.


But [keep a close eye on overall market conditions](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/). If the postelection Trump bounce fades, it will be difficult for stocks to launch big new moves.


Breach Or Breakout?
-------------------


Palo Alto is forming a flat base with a 163.11 entry. It gained 4% the day after the election in rising volume, then got within striking distance of a breakout on Thursday before reversing to close about 4% lower for the day.


On the positive side, the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock found support at its 50-day moving average, and rose farther above that line on Friday. Another telltale sign of technical strength is whether the 10-week line has crossed back over the 40-week moving average.



When the shorter-term line moves back above its longer-term cousin, it indicates renewed technical strength.


Related to that concept, the 10-day line has also moved back over the 50-day line after narrowly slipping below it.


While these clues do not guarantee success, they do point to rebounding technical strength.


Fundamentally Sound
-------------------


Palo Alto's chart action is backed by a track record of strong earnings and sales growth, earning it the No. 3 ranking among cybersecurity stocks. **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) and CyberArk hold the No. 1 and No. 2 slots, respectively.


Top line gains have ranged from 41% to 59% over the last eight quarters, while bottom-line growth has come in between 79% and 155% during the same period.


But note how EPS growth has slowed over the last four quarters. See if that trend reverses when Palo Alto Networks reports fiscal 2017 first quarter numbers on Nov. 21.

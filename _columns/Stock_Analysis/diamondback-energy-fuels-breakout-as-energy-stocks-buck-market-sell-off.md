Diamondback Energy In Pipeline Of Top Energy Stocks In Tough Market
-------------------------------------------------------------------


The [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have taken a beating this week. As colleague Jed Graham noted, the latest [Federal Reserve minutes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-minutes-heres-how-fast-balance-sheet-will-unwind-stock-market-slides/) marked an "apparent consensus that $4.5 trillion in Covid-era asset purchases unwind at a rate of more than $50 billion per month."


That triggered a downgrade in the stock market trend to "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-in-stocks-start-with-stock-market-investing-routine-routine/)," signaling a need for investors to be cautious about making new buys in this environment.


In the face of that pressure in the general market, Diamondback Energy tops its peers in the Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration and Production industry group, which ranks No. 34 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks. FANG stock earns the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), tying Matador Resources. Fellow energy stocks Northern Oil & Gas and Callon Petroleum are also highly rated in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


So as the current [sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-sector-rotation/) plays out, see if energy stocks continue to show relative strength.


Diamondback Energy In Buy Zone As Energy Stocks Power Up
--------------------------------------------------------


While the current market calls for caution, FANG stock and fellow energy plays continue to show strength. But even energy stocks ran into pressure on Friday. In this environment, one key to watch is the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/). A rising RS line shows a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.


The relative strength line for Diamondback Energy has climbed sharply as it clears as 117.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to enter a buy zone. FANG stock is now trading in the upper reaches of its [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).


Pioneer Natural Resources has also fueled a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) with its RS line trending sharply higher.


While still shy of a buy point, Matador Resources has retaken its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and Callon Petroleum is testing support at that benchmark line.

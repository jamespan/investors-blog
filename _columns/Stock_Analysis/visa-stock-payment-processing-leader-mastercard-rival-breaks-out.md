With a No. 21 ranking among 197 industry groups, payment processing companies lead the top stocks to watch. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and its rivals **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) are all in or near potential buy zones. Visa stock gapped up this week to clear a new entry.




Other top-ranked stocks within the payment processing group include **Paysign** ([PAYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYS)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and **Qiwi** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)). **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), an October 2018 [IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) backed by Warren Buffett, is also one to watch.


Based in San Francisco, Visa has a long track record of solid and steady earnings and sales growth. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 (ended June 30), Visa posted its sixth straight quarter of revenue north of $5 billion.


Average earnings growth over the last three quarters for Visa stock has come in at 17%. Analysts expect 18% EPS growth in the current quarter, with the report expected near the end of October.

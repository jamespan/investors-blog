Joining industry peers **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-scoop-up-apple-nvidia-microsoft-as-new-market-uptrend-begins/). Now ORLY stock is driving toward a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already at a new high.




Operating under its flagship brand, O'Reilly Auto Parts, O'Reilly leads the auto parts retailers group with a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). AZO stock (85) and AAP stock (83) join **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) (83) and **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) among the group leaders in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). After gapping down hard on earnings Thursday, **LKQ** ([LKQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LKQ)) has seen its Composite Rating drop from a 93 to a 72.


Ongoing [supply-chain issues](https://www.investors.com/news/orly-stock-rallies-toward-buy-point-after-earnings-beat-following-supply-crunch/) have pushed up prices for chips, auto parts and cars. In June, [Advance Auto Parts CEO Tom Greco](https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/chip-shortage-has-big-impact-on-new-cars-advance-auto-parts-ceo) noted how the chip shortage has a "big impact" on the cost of new cars. That is very good for auto parts retailers like Advance, O'Reilly and AutoZone.


O'Reilly Drives Accelerating Growth
-----------------------------------


Founded in 1957, O'Reilly Automotive is among the nation's largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories. It serves both professionals and do-it-yourself customers.


As of the end of 2021, O'Reilly operated 5,759 stores in 47 U.S. states. In 2019, the company completed its [first expansion outside the U.S.](https://corporate.oreillyauto.com/corporate-information-history), acquiring Mayasa Auto Parts. O'Reilly now has 25 ORMA stores in Mexico.


On Feb. 9, O'Reilly released [Q4 and 2021 earnings](https://corporate.oreillyauto.com/cmsstatic/O'Reilly%20Automotive,%20Inc.%20Fourth%20Quarter%20and%20Full-Year%202021%20Earnings%20Release.pdf), reporting record earnings and sales for the quarter. According the company's report, "The results represent 29 consecutive years of comparable-stores sales growth and record revenue and operating income for O'Reilly since becoming a public company in April of 1993."


In its Q4 report, the Missouri-based company posted acceleration in both sales (16%) and earnings (41%). Analysts expect 6% EPS growth this year, followed by an 11% gain in 2023.


ORLY Stock Revs Up Buy Point, Relative Strength
-----------------------------------------------


O'Reilly Automotive is working on an early stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) showing a 710.96 buy point.


Since retaking its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) in April 2020 following the [coronavirus crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/), ORLY stock has generally climbed right along that line.Â O'Reilly has seen good volume in the bottom and right side of the current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), a sign of demand.


With earnings behind it and its RS line already at a new high, see if ORLY stock can deliver volume 40% or more above average on the day of a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) attempt.


As always, keep an eye on the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), which have shown choppy action recently. Look for the indexes to get back above their 200-day moving averages to show rebounding technical strength.

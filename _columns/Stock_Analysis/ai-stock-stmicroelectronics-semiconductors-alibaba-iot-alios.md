Leading semiconductor and AI stock **STMicroelectronics** ([STM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STM)) tested a new buy zone, just days after announcing it completed validation of its inertial and pressure sensors for [AliOS Things](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/19/1441760/0/en/STMicroelectronics-Products-Complete-Alibaba-IoT-Validation-Enabling-Better-Time-to-Market-for-Customers.html), a new Internet of Things (IoT)-related operating system from Chinese internet giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)). But with the general market rattled by [intellectual property tariffs on China by President Trump](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-first-bombs-china-trade-war/), both STMicroelectronics and Alibaba were down Thursday.


As a core element of Alibaba's IoT ecosystem, AliOS Things enables users to create complete nodes and gateway solutions and reduce the amount of time it takes to get new offerings to market. Sensors produced by STMicroelectronics that have passed Alibaba's validation have been integrated into a sensor-based component of AliOS called uData.


Alibaba and STMicroelectronics are also cooperating in other ways on the development of IoT systems that aim to improve end-user experiences.


Leading AI Stock
----------------


Based in Switzerland, STMicrolectronics is a global semiconductor industry leader whose products "power the electronics at the heart of everyday life."


From self-driving car technology and factory automation to health care and IoT connectivity, STMicroelectronics' [artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) is used in a wide range of applications.


Like **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and Alibaba, STMicroelectronics has emerged as a leading AI stock, helping drive so-called AI at the edge, which is driving, among other things, the revolution in smart cars, smart homes and other applications and devices located at the edge of a network rather than in a centralized data center.

Explosive Earnings Growth
-------------------------


Over the last three quarters, STMicroelectronics has generated average EPS growth of 217%. Analysts are looking for a 116% increase in Q1 earnings when STMicroelectronics reports at the end of next month.


Quarterly revenue gains have accelerated over the last two reports, rising from 19% to 33% in Q4.


STMicroelectronics' 97 Composite Rating ties it with [IBD Big Cap 20 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) for the No. 1 ranking among semiconductor manufacturers. **Cypress Semiconductor** ([CY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CY)), Intel and **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) round out the top 5 leaders in the industry group.


Breakout Chip Stocks ... With Flaws
-----------------------------------


Intel has already broken out, and after a choppy, post-breakout period, is now 7% above its original buy point. The chip giant was down 1.4% Thursday, but that was a better showing than several of its fellow [chip stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/).


Like Intel, Cypress Semiconductor has shown seesaw action since breaking out in January, falling as much as 17% below the initial 17.52 entry. After falling over 3% Thursday, Cypress is now just 1% above that price.


STMicroelectronics, Analog Devices and Microchip Technology have been trading in or near a buy zone, but with the current market uptrend showing "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)," it's a risky time to buy any stock.


STMicroelectronics undercut the low in its prior base back in February to [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). On Wednesday, the stock cleared the 24.78 buy point in its new, first-stage cup with handle. Volume was rising, but still 21% below average — well below the 40% or higher spike you look for on the day of a breakout. The relative strength line has been rising, but remains below new high ground.


On Thursday, STMicroelectronics was down nearly 6% in rising volume, as the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 all sold off hard. But it did manage to close just above the 50-day moving average, so see if STMicroelectronics can stay above that benchmark line.



Like STMicroelectronics, Analog Devices reset its base count in February, then went on to form a cup with handle. It briefly cleared the 95.02 buy point, but has slipped back below it in recent day. Analog Devices fell over 2% Thursday to close just slightly below the 50-day line.


To further confirm that stocks of a feather do indeed flock together, Microchip Technology also reset its base count recently, then broke out of a new, first-stage chart pattern before pulling back. The stock is now 3% below the buy point.


Meanwhile, STMicroelectronics' IoT and AI partner Alibaba continues to work on a later-stage base showing a 206.30 buy point. Alibaba also fell sharply Thursday, losing more than 5% as it failed to close above the 10-week moving average.

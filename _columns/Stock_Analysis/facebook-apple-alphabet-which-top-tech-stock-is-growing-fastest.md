The mantra for the stock market is essentially, "What have you done for me lately? And what’s next?" It creates unending pressure on companies to continually grow and innovate.


So how are three top tech stocks -- **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) -- faring in rising revenue and profits?


Young Guns Vs. Middle-Aged Apple
--------------------------------


[Apple officially became middle-aged Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/middle-aged-apple-might-get-a-sports-car-new-girlfriend/) with its 40th birthday, but its 14% three-year annual sales growth rate and 19% three-year annual EPS growth rate still outpace those of the teenage Alphabet (14% and 13%, respectively).


But the even younger Facebook trumps both of its fellow tech titans. The social media giant has been growing revenue at an annual rate of 54% over the last three years, while earnings have risen at 71% annually over the same period.


Facebook’s 55.6% annual pretax profit margin has also allowed founder Mark Zuckerberg to place several multibillion dollar bets on [Instagram](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stretches-video-power-on-its-next-big-moneymaker/), WhatsApp and [Oculus VR](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oculus-rift-launches-will-sony-unveil-better-console-for-vr/) -- as well as invest heavily in mobile advertising and new apps like [Facebook Messenger](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-messenger-becoming-a-swiss-knife-that-could-poke-apple/). By comparison, Apple (31%) and Alphabet (33.1%) have smaller but still strong profit margins.


What’s Missing From Facebook’s Base?

It [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) during the August flash crash, launching what has become a three-part, base-on-base formation.


Over the last seven weeks, Facebook has shown tight trading while building the right side of the pattern and has stayed above its 10-week moving average. But one key element has been missing: volume.


Trading has been well below average, as reflected in the stock’s lowest-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Look for it to improve to at least a C or better as the stock tries to clear a 117.69 buy point.

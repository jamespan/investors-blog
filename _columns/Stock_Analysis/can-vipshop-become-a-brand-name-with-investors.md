One of the advantages of operating in an emerging market like China is that many sectors of the economy don't have big established players.

  

And as an Aug. 5 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/080213-666225-chinese-online-retailer-vipshop-holdings-sales-growth.htm) noted, that's where **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) comes in. It's a China-based, online discount retailer that sells clothing, household goods, cosmetics and other branded items.

  

In the U.S. big chains have had decades to build their brands and consolidate their leads. But in China discount retailers haven't been around that long.

  

So the field is thin and scattered, particularly outside of the major cities. And analysts say that creates growth opportunities for Vipshop in those markets.

  

The company specializes in "flash sales" where a set number of items are sold over a limited period of time, often during the retail off season.

  

And that helps manufacturers reduce overstocking by selling merchandise to customers who might not otherwise have access to it.

  

Vipshop has the exclusive rights to sell more than 700 brands. And it had 27 million registered users at the end of last year.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•The company was founded in 2008 and had a string of losses. It turned profitable in the third quarter of last year.

  

• Last quarter earnings totaled 17 cents a share vs. a 13-cent-a-share loss in the same quarter a year earlier.

  

• It's scored a long string of triple-digit sales growth gains.

  

• Vipshop is scheduled to post its latest results Aug. 14 after the close.

  

• For the full year, analysts see the company earning 91 cents a share compared to a 4-cent-a -share loss the previous year.

  

• They predict earnings will climb 85% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-vipshop-holdings-ltd-ads-vips.aspx) shows Vipshop is ranked No. 4 among the 26 stocks in its Retail-Internet industry group.

  

But those past losses do drag on its EPS Rating, which is only 79.

  

The industry group is ranked No. 10 among IBD's 197 groups. So it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock came public on the NYSE in March 2012 and started trading around $5.50 share. But it's scored some big gains since then.

  

The MarketSmith chart on this page shows stock formed a double-bottom pattern.

  

That was first base it formed when its price was high enough to attract big traders like mutual funds. That's why it's always a good idea to stick with stocks that trade at $15 a share or higher.

  

Vipshop broke out of that base last month and then climbed more than 20% in less than three weeks. And key IBD rule says a stock that makes that type of move should be held for at least eight weeks, unless sell signals appear.

  

The stock also gave investors a second buying opportunity when it climbed past the left side of that base.

  

But it's now too far extended to get into safely.

  

Still, it's a young stock so it may give investors other chances to get on board in the future and it might be worth a spot on you watch list.

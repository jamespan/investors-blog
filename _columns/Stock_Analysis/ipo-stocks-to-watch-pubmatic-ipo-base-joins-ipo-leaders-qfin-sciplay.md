As fellow IPO stocks **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) and **SciPlay** ([SCPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCPL)) take aim at new breakouts, **PubMatic** ([PUBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PUBM)) has cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) as it gets ready to announce its first earnings report as a public company.




The provider of advertising technology solutions for digital publishers posted 117% year-over-year EPS growth for Q3 prior to its stock market debut on Dec. 9. Boosted by a triple-digit rise in earnings-per-share and 33% sales increase for the quarter, PubMatic has already earned placement on [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).


PubMatic joins QFIN and SCPL on this screen for the best IPOs to buy and watch. **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)), which was featured on Leaderboard on Jan. 26, also made the cut.


[New IPO stocks can be volatile](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-ipo-stocks-lessons-from-facebook-snap/), as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), **Peloton Interactive** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)), **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and many others have shown in their early days of trading. FB, SNAP and BYND stock experienced a lot of turbulence before finding their footing.


Keep those lessons as cautionary tales as PubMatic, Maravai, SciPlay and QFIN stock set up. You can reduce your risk by waiting for IPO stocks to form their first [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) and break out before investing.


PTON, BYND, SNAP, PDD stock and certainly FB stock have shown that while it can be risky to buy IPO stocks right when they go public, new companies like PubMatic have the potential to deliver big gains.


PubMatic Takes Short Road To Profits With CTV
---------------------------------------------


Based in Redwood City, Calif., PubMatic combines its specialized cloud-based software with hardware that has been deployed in data centers around the world. Through 14 offices and eight data centers in North America, Europe and Asia, the company processes nearly a trillion advertiser bids and 134 billion ad impressions every day.


PubMatic's OpenWrap OTT provides a bidding solution to make it easier for publishers to sell ads. It also enables advertisers to access OTT (over-the-top) and CTV (connected TV) inventory.


OTT enables the streaming of content over the internet, circumventing the need for cable and satellite subscriptions. Similarly, CTV refers to any television able to access content on the internet without going through a cable provider. CTV enables the serving of  targeted, short-form advertising.


PubMatic has not set a date for its first post-IPO earnings release. But analysts expect the company to deliver 300% EPS growth in Q4 and a 543% increase for all of 2020.


The stock hasn't been trading long enough to establish an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), which requires at least 13 weeks. But it does sport a 1.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/), indicating demand.


IPO Stocks To Watch: PubMatic Programs IPO Base
-----------------------------------------------



PubMatic's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has been rising sharply and the stock has now jumped past the 38.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its IPO base.


Although the stock briefly cleared the entry on Jan. 21, it has since pulled back in light volume. On Friday, PubMatic popped nearly 10%,  ending the week in buy range.


While PubMatic shows promising fundamental and technical strength, keep in mind the [volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/) that surrounds earnings season and new IPO stocks. Just as SNAP, PTON, BYND and FB stock took time to establish their runs, SciPlay and QFIN stock have already experienced some turbulence.


Time will tell how Wall Street reacts to PubMatic's upcoming earnings report.

No. 1 Ranking Among Oil Stocks
------------------------------


Despite its modest 86 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), Marathon Oil holds the No. 1 ranking among integrated oil and gas stocks. Royal Dutch Shell comes in at No. 2 with an 81, while BP holds the third position with an 80.


Chevron's 73 Composite Rating earns it the No. 8 ranking, and Exxon is No. 16 among oil stocks with its score of 51.


Diamondback Energy (98 Composite Rating) and EOG Resources (95) are in the Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group, which ranks No. 14 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. Marathon Oil's integrated oil stocks group ranks No. 82.


In the first quarter, Marathon Oil delivered $1.7 billion in revenue, a year-over-year quarterly gain of 62%. Earnings also accelerated, with the company's second-straight quarter of triple-digit gains. But note that both of those increases are based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss.


For Q2, analysts are looking for a 175% spike in earnings per share.


Marathon Oil's B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-is-key-in-a-base/), 1.4 up/down volume ratio and one quarter of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for the stock.


Next Breakout Among Oil Stocks?
-------------------------------


Marathon Oil is building a flat base, which is part of a longer base-on-base formation. The buy point is 22.22.


The stock has been finding support at its 50-day line, and its relative strength line is within striking distance of a new high. But keep in mind that since the current [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) is "uptrend under pressure," it's best to proceed with caution and be very picky about making any new buys.


On Friday, Marathon Oil rose 2% to 20.91, putting it within 6% of the buy  point.


EOG Resources, which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-of-the-day-apple-oil-eog-resources-buy-point/), is trading around 3% below a 128.13 entry. Diamondback Energy, which was just [added to the Sector Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/best-growth-stocks-buy-watch-ibd-stock-lists/), recently bounced off its 40-week moving average and is now back above its 10-week line. It's been showing volatile action recently, but is up 5% for the week.

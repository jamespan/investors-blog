**WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) makes plant-based food, beverages, coffee creamers and dairy products sold under brands such as Horizon, Silk, Alpro and International Delight.

  

It's been a pioneer in turning organic and alternative offerings, such as almond milk, into more mainstream products.

  

This year, WhiteWave launched a new branded creamer with **Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)), the operator of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

First-quarter sales rose 36%, while earnings climbed 38% as both continued an accelerating growth trend.

  

On Thursday, WhiteWave reported Q2 numbers, again showing 36% higher sales and 38% EPS growth. That met estimates for earnings and topped revenue expectations. The company also raised full-year guidance.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Following its October 2012 IPO, it took two years and three bases before WhiteWave found its footing and began moving higher.

  

It broke out of a flat base in November 2013 and rose 47% in four months, finding support at its 10-week line along the way.

  

The stock then formed a choppy consolidation and broke out in May.

  

But after a few weeks of tight, sideways trading, it pulled back again to build a base-on-base pattern with a 33.25 buy point.

  

WhiteWave regained its 10-week moving average Thursday after reporting Q2 numbers.

  

It poked its head above the buy point during the day, then eased to close just below it.

  

But it was still up over 10% for the day on volume 275% above average, and the relative strength line shot into new-high ground.

  

The stock closed lower on Friday, less than 4% below the buy point.

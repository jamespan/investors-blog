After a pandemic-induced test by fire, the [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) Class of 2021 has gone on to produce some impressive gains. Notable members include **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), **Nu Holdings** ([NU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NU)), **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) and **Robinhood** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)). Fellow classmate **Sweetgreen** ([SG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SG)) — a purveyor of healthy fast food — has joined the party, with the stock back in buy range.


While Covid wreaked particular havoc on restaurants, Sweetgreen survived. Now demand from top funds and the company's expanding growth have shares soaring off their 2023 lows.




Sweetgreen Stock In Demand As Growth Expands
--------------------------------------------


While Sweetgreen did not make the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-meta-stock-ignore-nvidia-other-magnificent-seven-stocks/), it has flashed signs of demand. In addition to a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/), 35 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD have reported a position in Sweetgreen stock.


Its [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) stands at a neutral 1.0. Any number of above 1.0 points to demand, so look Sweetgreen to retake that benchmark. By comparison, fellow restaurant stock **Cava Group** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) — a 2023 IPO and the [Oct. 3 IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cava-stock-magic-formula-buy-point/) — sports a 1.5 up/down volume ratio alongside its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


While Sweetgreen does not have growth quite as explosive as that of Cava, it has established a track record of solid and steady gains.


Revenue growth has ranged from 21% to 29% over the last eight quarters. In the second quarter, Sweetgreen generated revenue of $184.6 million. Analysts expect the Los Angeles-based company to deliver 14% sales growth to $175.5 million when it reports Q3 numbers on Nov. 7.


Bottom-line growth has also been strong. Although Sweetgreen posted a loss of 13 cents per share in the second quarter, that marked a 46% year-over-year improvement. For the full year, analysts forecast a 27% gain to cut its loss to 74 cents per share. For 2025, Wall Street expects a 42% rise, but that still represents a loss of 43 cents a share.


Expansion Continues
-------------------


Sweetgreen's mission is to "build healthier communities by connecting people to real food." Featuring salads, warm bowls and sides, menu items include the Shroomami and Kale Caesar.


Sweetgreen opened its first location in 2007 and now has over 230 locations across the country, with a large footprint in California and New York. On Oct. 29, the company announced the opening of a [second North Carolina location](https://investor.sweetgreen.com/press/news-details/2024/Sweetgreen-Opens-Second-North-Carolina-Location-in-Raleigh/default.aspx) in Raleigh. The new location follows the recent Charlotte opening, signaling the company's continued expansion in the Carolinas.


Sweetgreen Stock Back In Buy Range
----------------------------------


Since clearing a 37.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) on Oct. 8, Sweetgreen has drifted in and out of buy range. After an initial jump early Thursday, the stock pulled back below that entry as the market came under pressure. But on Friday, Sweetgreen rose over 5%, lifting it back into buy range.


In a sign of strength and resilience, the stock has held support at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). After failing to hold the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Thursday, it rebounded Friday to reclaim that benchmark.


While Sweetgreen stock has seen its [Composite Rating improve to 80](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-sweetgreen-sg.aspx). By comparison, Cava earns a [98 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cava-group-cava.aspx). Sweetgreen earns a 98 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), just shy of Cava's highest-possible 99. This rating gauges a stock's strength compared with the entire universe of listed companies.


Sweetgreen's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) — which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 — fell in August but is rebounding toward a new 52-week high.


While it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports earnings, see if Sweetgreen can fortify its recent breakout when it unveils Q3 results on Nov. 7.


Cava, which reports earnings on Nov. 12, has eased off its all-time high as it loses support at its 21-day line.


Meanwhile, several of Sweetgreen's IPO Class of 2021 peers continue to shine. [Duolingo](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-duolingo-duol.aspx), [AppLovin](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applovin-stock-app-stock-compared-to-google/), and [Samsara](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-samsara-iot.aspx) are all extended from their most recent breakouts. Samsara, however dropped below its 50-day line on Friday.


On Thursday, [HOOD stock gapped down](https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-earnings-q3-robinhood-stock-first-annual-profit/) after coming up short of Wall Street's estimates, closing down over 16%. It retook its 50-day line on Friday.

On Aug. 8, bedbug exterminator and pest control leader **Rollins** ([ROL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROL)) celebrated its 50th year of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Now it's trying to add to the celebration with a new breakout from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).




Rollins acquired termite treatment provider Orkin way back in 1964, and now has over 700 operations in 55 countries through a variety of subsidiaries. Orkin is the largest Rollins company, and is by itself the largest pest control company in the U.S.


Orkin Canada, founded in 1954, is also Canada's largest pest control provider.


In October, Rollins announced a [three-for-two stock split](http://www.rollins.com/news/2018/10-23-2018-211936643) of its common shares. The additional shares will be distributed on Dec. 10 to stockholders of record on Nov. 9.

Pest Control Profits: Bed Bugs ProAct
-------------------------------------


The No. 1 reason why customers decide to not stay at a hotel is finding comments on bedbugs in an online review. To help the hospitality industry address those concerns, Orkin recently launched its Bed Bug ProAct service. The treatment program provides a more proactive way to help ensure an environment free of bedbug infestation.


Whether it's exterminating bedbugs, termites, ants or cockroaches, pest control is a profitable business for Rollins. Earnings growth over the last four quarters has ranged from 20% to 35%. The company has generated approximately $1.38 billion in revenue through the first nine months of this year.


The stock's 91 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 spot among its industry peers. But the group itself ranks a lowly No. 132 out of the 197 groups that IBD tracks. Ideally, it's best to focus on the [top stocks in the top industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=3853550).


But Rollins does sport solid numbers for both its annual pretax profit margin (17.6%) and return on equity (30.5%). The stock also has signs of strong institutional demand, including a 1.9 up/down volume ratio, B- Accumulation Distribution Rating and six quarters of rising fund ownership.


Breakout Watch With RS Line At New High
---------------------------------------


From a breakout in October 2016, Rollins' share price rose as much as 117% before pulling back to start forming its current base in September of this year. Throughout its climb, it's shown relatively tight trading and consistent [support at its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


Rollins' relative strength line remains near new-high ground, a bullish sign as a stock forms a base. The stock is trading around 3% below the 62.18 buy point in a [second-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) cup with handle.


But keep in mind that the current market outlook is "[market in correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970)," meaning it's best to avoid making any new buys. Instead, keep an eye on stocks like Rollins that are showing resilience and see if they take off when a new uptrend emerges.

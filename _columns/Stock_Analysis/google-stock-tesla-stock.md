Bad news keeps on coming for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), with Elon Musk blaming a ["tough quarter for everyone"](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-elon-musk-tough-quarter-for-everyone-analysts-chop-earnings-estimates/) as analysts cut full-year earnings predictions this week and Reuters reporting the [EV giant has killed plans](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-hits-new-lows-on-report-it-killed-low-cost-vehicle/) for its $25,000 vehicle. But **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) just flashed two triumphant returns, with one now coming under pressure.




First, [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) has rejoined fellow [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-nvidia-stock-uber-msft-google-meta/).


Alphabet made this monthly screen in [February](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-billions-in-this-unexpected-list-of-7-magnificent-stocks-including-nvidia/) when top money managers scooped up an estimated $950 million worth of Google stock. But the search, cloud computing and artificial intelligence giant fell off in March.


Alphabet surged back onto this stock screen in April. In the latest list, the best mutual funds poured roughly $3.7 billion into Google stock. These top money managers also made huge investments in [Nvidia](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/) ($12.3 billion), [Microsoft](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) ($11.4 billion) and [Meta](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-buy-now/) ($6.7 billion).


Other indicators of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/before-buying-stocks-check-the-institutional-ownership/) for Google stock include a 1.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/), B- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and seven quarters of [rising fund ownership](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-cl-a-googl.aspx).

Google Stock Returns To Buy Range — Briefly
-------------------------------------------


The second triumphant return for Alphabet was its rebound into buy range. But that return proved short-lived as the Nasdaq sold off Thursday, dragging down tech stocks, including Alphabet. Yet, the stock is showing resilience Friday, rising to close 1% shy of the buy point.


Shares of [Alphabet gapped down](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/googl-stock-google-earnings-q42023/) after reporting earnings Jan. 30 despite topping earnings estimates. The stock subsequently crashed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), eventually even dipping below its 200-day line.


But Google stock soon climbed back above both benchmarks, then gapped up on a report that **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was in talks with Alphabet to license [Google Gemini AI technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-google-in-talks-gemini-ai-system-iphone/) for use on iPhones.


Alphabet managed to hold and build on those gains to complete a second-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). The stock bounced past the 153.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Monday, albeit in light volume. The pattern remains intact, with Google ending the week within striking distance of the buy point.


Rising Technical Strength In Google Stock
-----------------------------------------


In addition to teasing a return to the buy zone, several other indicators bode well for the Magnificent Seven leader — if the market indexes can keep shaking off Thursday's retreat.


Although it remains below a 52-week high, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) has perked up since last month.


Alphabet has also seen its [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-cl-a-googl.aspx) rise to 94, much improved since last year. The grade in Stock Checkup shows Alphabet is outpacing 94% of all stocks in terms of key [stock-picking factors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Nvidia and Meta both earn the highest-possible 99 rating. On Thursday, Meta stock and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) both received analyst price-target hikes.


Meanwhile, Microsoft rates a 91, with [Tesla](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-tsla.aspx) has skidded to a lowly 31 Composite Rating.


For Google stock, the action in its moving averages reveals other indicators of improving technical strength.


Last May, the 50-day moving average moved back above the longer-term 200-day line. After a dip in February, the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) crossed above the 50-day line in March.


Whenever a shorter-term moving average moves back above a longer-term one, it points to rising and resilient technical strength.


For comparison with Alphabet, look at the chart for [Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/). It now trades below its 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Plus, the 21-day and 50-day lines have fallen below the longer-term 200-day benchmark. On Thursday, Tesla tried, but failed to retake its 21-day line.

When it comes to picking the leaders in the 3D printing industry, top-performing fund managers appear to be betting on **Proto Labs** ([PRLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRLB)) over **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)), **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)), **ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)) and even tech giant **HP** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)).


Four of the 19 funds that comprise the IBD Mutual Fund Index have reported a position in Proto Labs, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)). Only one of these typically better-performing funds -- Scout Small Cap ([UMBHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMBHX)) -- has a position in Stratasys, and none of them own shares in the other major industry players.


Two key factors are helping drive this institutional interest in the Minnesota-based company.


3D Printing: Sell The Service, Not The Machine
----------------------------------------------


First, Proto Labs has a different business model from its more widely-known peers.


While 3D Systems and Stratasys make and sell a mix of consumer and commercial 3D printers, Proto Labs focuses on the commercial market and doesn’t sell the machines. It offers industrial 3D printing as a service.


As indicated by its motto “Real Parts, Really Fast,” Proto Labs’ mission is to “radically reduce” the time to create prototypes and functional end-use parts.


HP is targeting a similar market. In an [interview with Fortune magazine](http://fortune.com/2016/03/08/hp-ceo-qa-3d-printing-layoffs/), CEO Dion Weisler said that the tech titan has stayed out of the consumer 3D printing business because “it’s not where the value is today. The value is in production and in prototyping.”


Weisler added that HP “will release a technology that’s ten times faster than anything else in the market” and can produce prototypes and relatively small quantities of parts at “a fraction of the cost” charged by rivals like Proto Labs.


Top Fundamentals Among Industry Peers
-------------------------------------


A second factor driving institutional demand for Proto Labs is the company’s fundamental strength, including a 32% annual EPS growth rate and 31.5% annual pretax profit margin. That’s more than double the 13% growth rate and 15.2% profit margin of its closest rival, 3D Systems.


Proto Labs holds the top ranking within its industry group and recently made Fortune magazine’s list of the “100 Fastest-Growing Companies.”


Proto Labs Molding First-Stage Base
-----------------------------------


Proto Labs [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in 2012, just as 3D printing stocks started to take off. For Stratasys, 3D Systems, Proto Labs and others, the run came to end in late 2013 and early 2014.

Since forming a bottom last month, Proto Labs closed higher for five straight weeks as its Relative Strength line moved into new high ground. Volume during that time was strong, another indication that fund managers have been picking up shares.


The stock gapped up on Mar. 4 to close over 8% higher on volume 1089% above average. That move came on news that Proto Labs would be added to the S&P SmallCap 600 GICS Industrial Machinery Sub-Industry index.


Investors should see if the stock can continue to move higher and clear its 80.05 entry point in heavy volume.

The cries of "retail is dead" seem to be on hold for now, but the retail industry is certainly changing. And a new deal with the nemesis of retailers everywhere — **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) — may give **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) the spark it needs to breakout into a new buy zone.




Earlier this month, Best Buy and Amazon an exclusive multiyear partnership where [Best Buy will sell Amazon's new Fire TV edition smart TVs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roku-stock-best-buy-amazon/).


Best Buy says the Amazon partnership showcases how Best Buy helps technology companies bring their products to life through hands-on, in-store experiences. In the case of Amazon, it's an opportunity to expand awareness of how its Alexa voice-control technology enhances the smart home and entertainment experience.


In another example of how Amazon is shifting somewhat from friend to foe with [leading retailers](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/), starting last year, **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) is now [accepting Amazon returns](https://www.investors.com/news/sign-of-the-times-kohls-will-start-accepting-amazon-returns/) at selected stores.


Best Buy Earnings Due
---------------------


Best Buy has approximately 1,500 stores across North America, generating $42.15 billion in revenue for fiscal 2018 (ended Feb. 3). Fiscal 2018 marked Best Buy's fourth consecutive year of positive full-year same-store sales growth.


For fiscal 2019, the company expects revenue to come in between $41 billion and $42 billion.


Best Buy, which pays a dividend currently yielding 2.3% on an annualized basis, is set to report fiscal 2019 Q1 numbers on May 24. Analysts expect a 23% rise in earnings.

Alexa: Will Amazon Fire TV Spark Best Buy Breakout?
---------------------------------------------------


Best Buy has risen over 200% since hitting a low in January 2016. The giant electronics retailer is now working on a second-stage base showing a 78.69 entry. More aggressive investors may target an earlier 77.42 buy point.


Note how Best Buy found support at its prior 63.42 entry while building the bottom of its current consolidation. Such behavior could mean Best Buy is building steppingstones for a continued climb.



In a sign of market leadership, Best Buy's relative strength line is floating near new-high ground ahead of a potential breakout.


Heading into Tuesday's close, Best Buy was rebounding from earlier losses and bouncing off its 10-day moving average. The stock is currently 4% below the 78.69 buy point. Amazon is retaking the 1,568.62 entry it initially cleared last week following its stellar earnings report. Kohl's is also working on a base, but is still trading below its 50-day line.


*Editor's Note: This story was updated to correct Best Buy's store count and fiscal 2018 revenue.*

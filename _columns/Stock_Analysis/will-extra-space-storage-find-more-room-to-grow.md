Today we'll look at **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), a real estate investment trust or REIT that acquires, develops and operates self-storage facilities in 35 states.

  

It's the country's second largest self-storage operator, and also manages facilities for other companies. Extra Space Storage has been named the best third-party management company for three consecutive years, including 2014, by the trade publication, Inside Self-Storage.

  

Also, as Marilyn Alva [noted in IBD last week](http://news.investors.com/business/101014-721263-avalonbay-and-post-properties-among-top-reit-returns.htm), U.S. real estate investment trusts outperformed broader equity markets in the first nine months of this year.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Extra Space Storage has a track record of strong and steady growth. Revenue gains have come in between 21% and 33% over the last eight quarters. And earnings growth has ranged from 24% to 39% during the same period.

  

The company is scheduled to report Q3 numbers on Oct. 29.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 18%, followed by a 10% gain in 2015.

  

While the 11% return on equity is below the 17% minimum you'd prefer to see, Extra Space Storage has a strong three-year annual EPS growth rate of 50%.

  

Also note that the company pays a dividend with a yield of 3.4%.

  

Overall, Extra Space Storage earns a 98 Composite Rating and its B Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate buying over the last 13 weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The company's steady sales and earnings growth has led to a steady rise in its share price in recent years.

  

The stock tends to trade in a relatively tight range, generally finding support at its 10-week line. And that has remained the case even in the face of recent market weakness.

  

Extra Space Storage has been working on a flat base for eight weeks. The stock fell below the 10-week line in September, but then had three weeks of tight closes in the bottom of the base before climbing back above the 10-week moving average.

  

The ideal buy point is 54.97, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

On Tuesday, the stock broke out and closed just above the buy point. Volume was 43% above average. On Wednesday, it fell back below the pivot during the session, but managed to close right around it.

  

Keep in mind that has been happening while the general market is in a correction. That means now is not an ideal time to buy stocks, but it also means Extra Space Storage is showing strength and resilience in trying to buck the market trend. That's positive action and could mean the stock is poised to move higher once the general market rebounds.

  

That resilience is reflected in the Relative Strength line which has been trending sharply higher.

  

So while now is not an ideal time to make new buys, Extra Space Storage may be one to watch, especially if it reports strong Q3 numbers on Oct. 29.

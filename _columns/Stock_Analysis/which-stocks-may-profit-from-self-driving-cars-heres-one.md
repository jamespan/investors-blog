 As **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and others rev up self-driving cars, lesser-known IBD 50-stock **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) is providing the "eyes" and cybersecurity needed for autonomous vehicles to arrive safely at their destinations.
Given its recent chart action, Synopsys may also help investors spot a new profit-making opportunity.


IoT Leader
----------


While Internet of Things technology has made our cars, phones and homes "smart," it also invites increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.


As a leader in electronic design automation and semiconductor intellectual property, Synopsys works with technology companies to make sure their chip designs, apps and other offerings are secure, stable and compliant with relevant regulations. It works in a wide range of industries, including automotive, retail, financial services and health care.


Last year, Synopsys launched the DesignWare EV6x family of next-generation embedded vision processors, which help self-driving cars navigate the road.


On March 15, it announced a partnership with **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) to incorporate DesignWare technology into the chip giant's latest low-power process.


The company's three-year annual growth rates for earnings (10%) and sales (8%) aren't exceptional, but Synopsys posted accelerating gains for fiscal 2017 Q1, ended Jan. 31. Sales jumped from 8% to 15%, while EPS growth spiked from 15% to 38%.


Synopsys' Up/Down Volume Ratio of 0.7 is below the 1.0 or higher benchmark you look for, but eight quarters of rising fund ownership and a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating point to institutional demand.


Synopsys earns the No. 2 spot among software designers, behind **Mentor Graphics** ([MENT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MENT)) and ahead of **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)).


Tightly Wound And Ready To Pop?
-------------------------------


After reporting earnings, Synopsys gapped up Feb. 16 to close more than 6% higher in volume 215% above average.


The stock has held those gains, trading in a tight range as its Relative Strength line moved into new high ground — a sign of resilience and market leadership.


Synopsys remains within the narrow price range, closing the week about 1.6% higher in quiet trade.


See if the stock can spring past the 73.18 buy point in heavy volume.

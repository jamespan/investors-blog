With first-quarter earnings season right around the corner, now is the time to build your list of the [best stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/), with a focus on companies like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and [leading Chinese stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) that are expected to deliver earnings growth of 50% or higher.




To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and meet the following benchmarks for its [IBD SmartSelect Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which measure the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/):  

• 95 or better Composite Rating.  

• 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating.  

• 80 or greater EPS Rating.  

• B or higher Accumulation Rating.


Stocks To Watch Ahead Of Q1 Earnings
------------------------------------


Many stocks on the list below have already broken out and are now extended beyond their proper buy zones. Stocks that fit that bill include Netflix, Twitter, Salesforce, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and top-rated medical sector stock **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)).


[FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) Netflix has now soared more than 50% above the 204.48 buy point it cleared in January. And while many investors had written off Twitter, the microblogging pioneer has shown a vibrant rebound, both in terms of its share price and its fundamentals. Twitter posted a 73% spike in earnings in Q4, and analysts expect a 98% jump in Q1.


Like Netflix, Twitter is also more than 50% above of its most recent breakout, which it launched in December.

But not all the stocks on the list below are out of buy range.


**Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)), a [top 2017 tech IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) which designs and manufactures data storage products that can be used in personal computers, laptops and smartphones, broke out Friday and remains within the buy zone 43.26- 45.42 entry.


Keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock just before an earnings report, and Smart Global is on tap to release its latest numbers on March 22. The Newark, Calif.-based company faces very high expectations, with analysts looking for a whopping 1,309% spike in earnings.



Highly rated biotech stock **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)), which was [featured in The New America column](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/how-this-biotech-is-worth-3-5-billion-without-selling-one-drug/) earlier this month, showed a negative, heavy-volume reversal Friday that erased the bulk of its gains from a recent breakout. But the stock did manage to find support at its 170.40 entry.


[IBD Big Cap 20 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) is also in buy range after [breaking out from a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/large-cap-leader-shows-conflicting-signals-crucial-juncture/).


While Baozun is already more than 25% above its [massive breakout last week](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/baozun-soars-toward-buy-point-as-china-online-sales-specialist-earnings-top/), fellow Chinese internet stock Baidu is still working on a new, and somewhat sloppy, base.


**SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), which was recently featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/best-mutual-funds-buy-svb-financial-applied-materials-lam-research/) and was [just added to IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/), is now back above its 263.19 buy point. The owner of Silicon Valley Bank was also joined by Lam Research and Abiomed on the latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/best-mutual-funds-buy-svb-financial-applied-materials-lam-research/).


Flooring retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) is building a cup with handle showing a 48.77 entry as it closes in on the one-year anniversary of its April 27, 2017 IPO.

Don't Miss An Earnings Beat
---------------------------


To build and update your  earnings season watch list, regularly check the [earnings calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) to see which stocks are getting ready to report, and keep an eye on IBD's daily highlights of [stocks near a buy zone ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/tag/Stocks-Near-Buy-Zone-Ahead-Of-Earnings/).


The trick to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watch list and action plan. When a company delivers an earnings surprise and breaks out, you want to be there, ready to pounce.


But keep in mind that disappointing numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.


So use screens like the one here as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as we head into the Q1 earnings season.


Also be sure to [run all your stocks through a buying checklist](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IBD_BuyingChecklist.pdf) before you invest, use sound [sell rules](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) and [check overall market conditions](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/).

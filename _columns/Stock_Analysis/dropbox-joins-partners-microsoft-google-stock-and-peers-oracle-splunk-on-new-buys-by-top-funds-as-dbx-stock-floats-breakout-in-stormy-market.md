To paraphrase the Rolling Stones, **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) embraces a philosophy of "hey you, get onto my cloud" in its cloud storage and collaboration business.




From **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM))-owned Slack, Dopbox works with a slew of tech leaders. That has the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for DBX stock floating around a 52-week high.


Based in San Francisco, Dropbox has more that 700 million registered users across 180 countries. With a mission to "design a more enlightened way of working," the company has built a global private network with regional accelerators deployed across North America,  

Europe, Asia, and Australia.


To that end, Dropbox stores more than 90% of its user data on its own custom-built storage infrastructure.


The company's infrastructure has led to a reduction in latency — the time required for a data packet to move from one place — by as much as 50%. That allows users to retrieve data faster, more reliably and more securely.


Dropbox, Google Stock In Demand Among Top Funds
-----------------------------------------------


Top money managers have shown demand for Dropbox stock, earning DBX stock a spot on this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/is-the-ai-boom-over-this-shows-the-top-funds-dont-think-so/). The [cloud stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) joined five other peers in the Computer Software-Database industry group, including **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)).


Atlassian and [Google stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) also made this [stock screen](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/).


With a 98 Composite Rating, [DBX stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-dropbox-dbx.aspx) scores among the top-rated stocks in its industry, just behind **Elastic** ([ESTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESTC)), Splunk and MongoDB. Showing the power of database stocks, the group ranks a strong No. 15 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


Note that last month, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) announced it will acquire Splunk. The [Cisco-Splunk deal](https://investor.cisco.com/news/news-details/2023/Cisco-to-Acquire-Splunk-to-Help-Make-Organizations-More-Secure-and-Resilient-in-an-AI-Powered-World/default.aspx) is valued at roughly $28 billion and is expected to close in the third quarter of next year.


Dropbox has generated accelerating earnings growth over the last three quarter. Gains have ranged from a 2% slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year to a 34% spike to 51 cents a share in Q2. Sales growth remains in the high single-digits, including a 9% year-over-year gain in the second quarter to $622.5 million.


Dopbox is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 2 after the market close. Consensus analyst forecasts call for earnings of 49 cents. For the full year, Wall Street expects EPS growth of 21%.

DBX Stock Finding Support For A Fresh Breakout
----------------------------------------------


After closing higher for 11 straight weeks starting in May, DBX stock hit some resistance in July. Dropbox has continued to show strength and resilience while forming a new [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) offering a 28.68 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), but selling pressure in the market is now putting that to the test.


The new setup is a first-stage base. Such early stage consolidations are more likely to produce successful [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Of course, the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) — particularly during earnings season — have a major impact on individual stocks. It's always risky to buy any stock in any type of market just before it reports quarterly results.


As DBX stock and Atlassian both get ready to report on Nov. 2, Dropbox partners Microsoft and Alphabet are both on deck to report Tuesday.


Dropbox fell below its 50-day moving average as the [10-year Treasury yield climbed to a new 16-year high](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chair-powell-strikes-a-balance-as-10-year-treasury-yield-faces-these-risks/) Thursday as Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell spoke at the Economic Club in New York.


While the flat base remains intact, DBX stock dropped over 2% Friday. Volume, however, was below average, as sign that large investors are not yet aggressively dumping shares.

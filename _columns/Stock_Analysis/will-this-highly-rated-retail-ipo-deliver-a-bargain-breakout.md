Among the five top-rated discount retailer stocks, No. 2-ranked **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) is the newest kid on the stock market block. And it's trying to celebrate its July 2015 IPO by breaking past a new buy point.


**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) ([featured in the July 15 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/discount-retailer-big-lots-vs-rivals-five-below-dollar-tree)), round out the top five stocks in the discount retailer industry group, which ranks No. 42 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Discounts Drive Profits
-----------------------


Founded in 1982, Ollie's Bargain Outlet operates 215 self-described "semi-lovely" stores offering "good stuff cheap" in 19 states across the Eastern half of the country.


Although the company runs on a relatively thin annual pretax profit margin of 8.5%, Ollie's has posted two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including an 82% rise for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which ended April 30. Comparable store sales for Q1 grew 6%.


The company is expected to report Q2 numbers in September.


Like with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which cleared a buy point on Wednesday, Ollie's Bargain Outlet has some [technical blemishes](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/facebook-setting-up-ahead-of-q2-earnings-but-with-blemishes/), primarily a lack of volume. That's reflected in the 0.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio and C Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


On a more positive note, the number of funds with a position in Ollie's has been rising in recent quarters, and three typically better-performing mutual funds have reported owning shares, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).


Breakout Attempt: Take Two
--------------------------


Ollie's was [featured in the IBD Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/020416-792065-ipo-watch-will-ollies-prove-a-long-term-bargain-for-investors.aspx) on Feb. 4, as it was forming a handle in its first post-IPO base. It cleared the 22.63 entry during the week ended March 18, launching a 26% run over the next six weeks.


Investors who held shares in Ollie's as it started pulling back in late April could have turned to the old Kenny Rogers song "The Gambler" for some sage advice about the need to "know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."


A helpful sell rule for breakouts is to [take profits at 20%-25%](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=739143&sourceid=735788), since most stocks will pull back to form a new base at that point -- as Ollie's Bargain Outlet did.


The stock is now working on a second-stage [double bottom](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2) with a 26.65 entry.


While forming that pattern, Ollie's found support right around the prior [cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787) buy point and reclaimed its 10-week moving average.


On Tuesday, Ollie's tried to clear a break out but pulled back. It closed slightly lower Wednesday, ending the day around 2% below the 26.65 buy point.

Today we'll look at **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), a Seattle-based company made up of Alaska Airlines, founded in 1932, and Horizon Air, founded in 1981. Together, the two companies service over 90 destinations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

  

On Tuesday, the company announced it would be offering nonstop flights from Portland to Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. And before the market open today, Alaska Air implemented a 2-for-1 stock split, reducing the share price from just under $100 to around $48.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Alaska Air has done a nice job of rebounding from its report of -4% EPS growth in Q2 of last year. It's now shown accelerating growth in each of the last 3 quarters, including a triple-digit gain in the latest report.

  

With the exception of the third quarter in 2013, sales growth has remained in the single-digits. Ideally, you'd see gains of at least 20% to 25%.

  

The company is scheduled to report second quarter earnings on July 24.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 167%, followed by a 12% rise in 2015.

  

Alaska Air sports a strong 22% return on equity, helping it earn an A for its SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE.

  

The company's annual EPS growth rate of 52% helps it garner a 98 EPS Rating, and overall it earns a 97 Composite Rating.

  

The B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks, while the 0.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio is a bit below the 1 or higher score you'd prefer to see.

  

But the number of funds that own Alaska Air has been on the rise, and three typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX), Scout Small Cap (UMBHX), and Franklin Growth A (FKGRX).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Alaska Air broke out of a first-stage, 19-week cup-with-handle in Sep. of last year. The stock rose over 20% before correcting, testing its 10-week line as it formed a second-stage flat base. The stock continued higher from there, finding support along its 10-week line during that run.

  

Alaska Air started pulling back towards its 10-week moving average line in June. On Jun. 12, it fell below that benchmark on volume 102% higher than normal. This came on news oil prices were spiking due to rising violence in Iraq. Plus, there was continued fallout from German air carrier Lufthansa lowering its profit target.

  

Since then, the stock has been working on a third-stage flat base. The tight trading in the bottom of the base is positive, but the 10-week line has been an area of resistance, with the stock struggling to get back above that benchmark.

  

The ideal buy point is 50.59, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if the stock can punch through that price point on volume at least 40% - 50% above average.

  

Keep in mind that Alaska Air is scheduled to report Q2 numbers on Jul. 24. Also, the market outlook changed Tuesday from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure," which means it's time to proceed with caution.

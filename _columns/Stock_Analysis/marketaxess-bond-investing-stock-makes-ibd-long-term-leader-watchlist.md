As the stock market tries to fight off recent selling pressure, bond investing leader **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)) is testing a 561.78 buy point.




With a strong record of stable earnings growth, MarketAxess is on the watchlist for [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/).

MarketAxess is highly profitable, sporting a 50.3% annual pretax profit margin.

On Oct. 27, [MarketAxess reported Q3 earnings](https://investor.marketaxess.com/news-releases/news-release-details/marketaxess-reports-third-quarter-2020-revenues-1640-million), posting 25% growth for both sales and earnings.

Fintech Leader MarketAxess Near Breakout, All-Time High
-------------------------------------------------------


A look at a monthly stock chart shows the remarkable gains MarketAxess has made since the start of the bull market in 2009. With Q3 earnings behind it, the fintech stock is now trying to retake the 561.78 buy point it briefly cleared on Oct. 21.


MarketAxess jumped nearly 5% in rising and above-average volume Tuesday in what seemed like a good breakout. But it has since eased back below the entry. On Friday, MarketAxess is trading 3% below the buy point, but staying above its 21-day moving average.


While the stock market uptrend is under pressure, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) for MarketAxess has been soaring. As the market tries to find its footing, see if MarketAxess can retake its buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

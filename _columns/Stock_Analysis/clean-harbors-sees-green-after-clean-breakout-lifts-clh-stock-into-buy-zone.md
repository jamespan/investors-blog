Clean Harbors Posts Accelerating Earnings Growth
------------------------------------------------


On Feb. 23, Clean Harbors posted accelerating Q4 earnings growth of 41%, leading to average EPS increases of 66% over the last three quarters. To kick off 2022, analysts expect the company to deliver Q1 earnings growth of 69%. Over the last three years, Clean Harbors has generated average annual EPS gains of 39%.


On the sales front, the environmental sustainability specialist has cleaned up after recent quarters of declining revenue. It posted quarterly sales gains ranging from 22% to 41% in its last three reports.


In a sign of solid [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-how-the-laws-of-supply-and-demand-lead-to-major-moves-for-growth-stocks/), 23 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning CLH stock. The company has also posted six quarters of rising fund ownership and sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and 1.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/).


Sustainability Leader In Buy Zone
---------------------------------


In January, Clean Harbors undercut the low in its prior [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). That made the stock's current formation a first-stage base with a 110.77 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


Clean Harbors cleared that entry on Tuesday and remains in the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). Volume on the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) was only 11% above average but rising. The stock closed Friday up over 5% for the week. That comes after Clean Harbors posted several weeks of heavy-volume gains as it completed its latest base, a positive sign of demand for shares.


Look for the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) to get back to the high it hit earlier this month as it continues to rebound. Also look for the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) to get back above the longer-term 200-day line to confirm renewed technical strength. The [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) is already well above both of those longer-term moving averages.

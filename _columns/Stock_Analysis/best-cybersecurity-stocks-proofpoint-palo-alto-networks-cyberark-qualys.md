Cybersecurity stocks **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) have been rising as cyberattacks on cloud networks, email and mobile apps have increased. Now fellow security software firm **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) is trying to hack into a new buy zone.




"More than 90% of all cyberattacks start with an email — and Proofpoint has been on the front lines of securing this critical communication channel for over a decade," said Tony D'Angelo, a top executive for Proofpoint.


The Silicon Valley-based company offers next-generation cybersecurity products for email, mobile apps and other [cloud-based programs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) and smart devices.


Since its founding in 2002, Proofpoint has developed an impressive list of clients. More than half of the Fortune 100, seven of the top 10 global retailers and five of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies use its cybersecurity software.

Best Cybersecurity Stocks
-------------------------


The [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-news-performance-reports-investing-ideas/) have taken note of the strong demand for security software. And their heavy investments have helped lift the security software industry group's ranking to No. 7 out of 195.


With a 90 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Proofpoints holds the No. 6 spot among its peers. Palo Alto Networks, Qualys, CyberArk, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Nice** ([NICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NICE)) hold the top five rankings.


Proofpoint's annual sales growth has been strong and steady, averaging 39% over the last three years. Over the last eight quarters, revenue gains have ranged from 35% to 46%. Earnings growth slipped in Q1, from 61% to 36%.


How does Proofpoint's top- and bottom-line growth stack up against Palo Alto Networks and Qualys, both of which earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating?


Proofpoint's 39% annual sales growth rate over the last three years tops that of both Palo Alto Networks (36%) and Qualys (19%). But its 43% average EPS growth over the last three quarters falls short of Palo Alto Networks (44%) and Qualys (53%).


Hacking Into Cybersecurity Breakout?
------------------------------------


Proofpoint is working on a second-stage flat base showing a 130.37 buy point. The stock close right along its 10-week line as it build the bottom of that chart pattern. Such support is one of [three telltale clues to look for in a stock](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


Proofpoint currently has a middling C- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, but it has seen four straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


In afternoon trading Thursday, the stock was off around 1% but was again finding support at its 50-day moving average. Look for it to bounce off that benchmark line and to push through the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

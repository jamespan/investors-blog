After the close Tuesday, 2014 IPO stock **Rubicon Project** ([RUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUBI)) reported record Q1 earnings, pushing it over 4% higher in after-hours trading.


Founded in 2007, Rubicon provides cloud-based advertising solutions, including creating an exchange where over 100,000 advertisers and more than 1,500 publishers negotiate pricing for highly targeted ads. 


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) dominate the [$170 billion digital advertising marke](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/rubicon-project-is-changing-advertising-sales-one-millisecond-at-a-time/)t, selling a combined $87 billion in advertising in 2015. But Rubicon is growing its presence, managing over $1 billion in ads last year. 


Teaming Up On Facebook, Google
------------------------------


The Los Angeles-based company is also partnering with The Guardian, Financial Times, CNN International, Reuters and the Economist to create the [Pangaea Alliance](http://www.pangaeaalliance.com/), where these large publishers will pool their ad inventory and user data to better compete with Facebook and Google for their share of the online advertising pie. 


No. 1 Among Industry Peers
--------------------------


Rubicon earns the top ranking within the Computer Software- Enterprise industry group, boosted by a 98 Composite Rating, 58% three-year annual sales growth and a 17.8% annual pretax profit margin.


Six straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth doesn't hurt either. 


Demand for the stock is reflected in the B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a strong 2.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio. 


After the close Tuesday, the company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31, an increase of 1,450% year-over-year. Revenue grew 86%.


Will Rubicon Pop On Earnings?
-----------------------------


After two years of choppy trading following its April 2014 IPO, Rubicon may be setting up for a new run.

The stock has shown signs of accumulation in the right side of the base, including recapturing its 10-week moving average in heavy volume in February and closing higher for nine of the last 11 weeks. The rising Relative Strength line is another bullish sign. 


See if Rubicon Project opens strongly Wednesday and jumps into a 20.47 to 21.49 buy zone.

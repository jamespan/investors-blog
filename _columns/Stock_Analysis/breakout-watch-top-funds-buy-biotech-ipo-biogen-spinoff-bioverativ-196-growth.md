 From **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) to **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Supernus Pharmaceuticals** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)), biotech stocks have a long history of launching huge price runs. And while Biogen has struggled recently, its spinoff and 2017 IPO **Bioverativ** ([BIVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIVV)) may be getting ready to launch a move of its own.
Bioverativ develops therapies to treat hemophilia and other blood disorders, and is beefing up its product pipeline with its plan to purchase True North Therapeutics for $400 million.


Through the acquisition announced last month, Bioverativ will pick up worldwide rights to True North's TNT009, "a first-in-class monoclonal antibody in development to treat cold agglutinin disease (CAD)." The FDA has granted TNT009 a breakthrough drug designation.


A+ Funds Investing In Bioverativ
--------------------------------


While sales growth slowed to 35% in Q1, Bioverativ sports a three-average revenue growth rate of 196%. The company also has a strong 54% return on equity and 35% pretax profit margin.


Earnings growth has averaged 39% over the last three quarters, including a spike to 64% in Q1.


Since its initial public offering in February, institutional demand for Bioverativ shares has been impressive, with 587 funds already establishing a position in the stock. That includes 142 A- or higher rated funds, among which 49 earn the highest possible grade of A+.


Building First Post-IPO Base
----------------------------


Unlike this year's big buzz IPO from **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), which has failed to gain traction, Bioverativ has had a successful debut, more along the lines of March IPO and recent breakout stock **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)).


From a first-day close of 44.98 on Feb. 2, Bioverativ climbed as high as 59.50 by May 1, a gain of 24%.



The stock then pulled back and is now working on a flat base, finding good support along its 10-week line.


The 1.2 Up/Down Volume Ratio points to demand, but the D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating is below the C or better grade you look for. See if that improves as the stock tries to complete the base and clear the 59.60 buy point in heavy volume.


On Wednesday, Bioverativ flashed a negative reversal, giving back early gains to close at the bottom of the price range in rising volume. The stock also fell in early trade on Thursday, but found support at and bounced off its 10-day moving average, putting it on pace to recoup the earlier declines and close in the upper half of the price range.


Also note how the 10-day moving average climbed back above the longer term 50-day line earlier in the week - a sign of renewed technical strength.

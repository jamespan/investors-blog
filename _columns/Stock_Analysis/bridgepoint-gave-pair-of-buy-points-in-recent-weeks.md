Sometimes a stock gives investors multiple opportunities to buy it, and that's the case with **Bridgepoint Education** ([BPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BPI)).

  

The stock carved out a cup-without-handle base from March through May 1 that developed within a larger correction.

  

The cup without handle had positive traits, including tight price action and light volume as the pattern bottomed 2.

  

It broke out past a 20.60 buy point in heavy trading, which gave investors their first chance to buy. Bridgepoint closed below the buy point and slipped after the breakout. Yet, shares rebounded and formed a high handle with a 21.91 buy point 3.

  

It broke out past that buy point on May 25 in heavy trading, which provided a second buying opportunity.

  

Some investors taking a long-term perspective would observe that Bridgepoint remains in a correction that dates back to April 2010 4. That may create yet another chance to get on board.

  

Accumulation has been strong since Bridgepoint broke out 5 .

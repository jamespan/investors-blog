This month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-microsoft-stock-topples-nvidia/) reveals that savvy investors want in on cybersecurity stocks. **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) all made this screen. And now [CrowdStrike](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-crowdstrike-holdings-crwd.aspx), [Palo Alto](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-palo-alto-networks-panw.aspx) and [CyberArk stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-cyberark-software-cybr.aspx) are spearheading a new [brigade of breakouts](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/palantir-stock-google-netflix-crowdstrike-breakout-stocks/).




CyberArk Leads Top-Rated Cybersecurity Stocks
---------------------------------------------


The ubiquitous presence of cloud-based networks and the ever-rising tsunami of artificial intelligence cause security risks for large and small enterprises — and demand for leading [cybersecurity stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cybersecurity-stocks/).


With the highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), CyberArk edges out CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks for top billing in the cybersecurity group. **Gen Digital** ([GEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEN)), which also made the latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds, ranks just behind its peers with a still-strong 96 rating.


Additionally, each of these four cybersecurity leaders earns a B- or better [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/), indicating solid buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


In another sign of leading demand, CyberArk outstrips its peers with a strong 2.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). For that metric, anything over 1.0 points to demand.


Gen Digital sports a 1.5 up/down volume ratio, slightly topping the 1. 4 score for Palo Alto Networks. CrowdStrike comes in below the 1.0 mark at 0.8.

CyberArk Moves 'Fearlessly Forward' — With A Human Touch
--------------------------------------------------------


Based in Israel, CyberArk focuses on [privileged access accounts](https://www.cyberark.com/products/privileged-access/). Such accounts have access to administrative tasks and other highly sensitive areas within an organization. CyberArk claims to provide the most comprehensive security offering for any identity — human or machine — across business applications, distributed workforces and hybrid cloud environments.


Companies ranging from [network giant](https://www.cyberark.com/customer-stories/cisco/) **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) to video game maker [Capcom](https://www.cyberark.com/customer-stories/capcom/) use CyberArk to protect critical assets.


Meanwhile, last month CyberArk released a video series titled "[Fearlessly Forward](https://investors.cyberark.com/news/news-details/2024/CyberArk-Introduces-Fearlessly-Forward-Customer-Video-Series-that-Explores-the-Human-Connections-Behind-Cybersecurity/default.aspx)." The series focuses on the people behind cybersecurity and the human connections forged to secure organizations in a cloud-based, always connected world where potential identity-based breaches are a constant threat. The first episode features health insurer **Aflac** ([AFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFL)), a CyberArk customer since 2014.


Earnings Growth Of 1,223% Projected
-----------------------------------


Revenue growth for CyberArk ranged from 24% to 37% over the last five quarters. On May 2, the company posted a third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth, to $221.6 million, a 37% jump over the prior-year quarter.


On the earnings front, the cybersecurity firm has seen a sharp turnaround in recent quarters. After declining profits in 2022, CyberArk delivered a 355% increase in earnings to $1.12 per share in 2023.


For the full year, analysts expect an 81% gain to $2.03 per share, followed by a 61% increase to $3.26 a share in 2025.


For 2024's first quarter, the company posted earnings of 75 cents a share, reversing from a loss in the prior year's quarter. With second-quarter earnings expected in early August, Wall Street forecasts a whopping 1,223% jump to 40 cents a share.

CYBR Stock Nears Breakout To All-Time High
------------------------------------------


CyberArk has formed a second-stage consolidation showing a 283 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). In a sign of rising technical strength, both the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) have started trending upward. Plus, the [21-day exponentional moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has crossed back above the 50-day line.


A [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) would lift CyberArk stock to a record high. After rising nearly 6% last week, CYBR stock reversed off earlier lows this week to close with a small gain.


Meanwhile, CrowdStrike stock has formed a string of tight weeks after gapping up to clear a 358.84 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) in June. The tight area could offer a chance for investors to add shares.


Palo Alto Networks continues to rebuild after a sharp drop below its 10-week line in February. But after posting a string of up weeks, Palo Alto stock has climbed solidly back above that benchmark line, which has turned higher. The relative strength line has also perked up.

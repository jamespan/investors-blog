Online payment leader **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) has been trying to show strength in this volatile market after resetting its base count. Will PayPal stock pay off for investors when a new market uptrend eventually begins?




Heading into Friday's market sell-off, the **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) spinoff had been trying to show resilience as it works on a new consolidation. But keep in mind that with the [market in a correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), it's best to avoid making any additional buys until a new rally takes hold. PayPal's downturn to close the week reinforces that point.


Meanwhile, be sure to build your watch list with a focus on [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) like PayPal that are down but still showing market-leading [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) during the current correction.

PayPal Stock On IBD 50 And IBD Big Cap 20
-----------------------------------------


PayPal has been on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), both of which have a track record of [beating the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


With a 97 Composite Rating, PayPal shares the No. 1 ranking among credit card and payment processing providers with **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which was recently featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mastercard-stock-market-weak-payment-stocks/).  **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Evertec** ([EVTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVTC)) round out the top 5 stocks in the industry.


The group ranks a middling No. 70 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


PayPal's earnings growth has ranged from 17% to 31% over the last eight quarters. Revenue gains have come in between 14% and 26% during the same period. But sales growth has slowed over the last three quarters, so look for that trend to reverse in Q4.


In one sign of institutional sponsorship for PayPal, the stock has seen eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 272 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-large-cap-stocks-warren-buffett-berkshire-starbucks-adobe-cvs/) with an A+ rating own shares.


A MoffettNathanson analyst recently said that if PayPal extends its partnership with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), it could mean as many as [60 million new members](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/paypal-could-get-big-boost-from-expanded-facebook-partnership-analyst.html) and $1.5 billion in incremental revenue for PayPal.


PayPal Stock Resets Base Count
------------------------------


Over the summer, PayPal formed a third-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). But it has since undercut the low in that consolidation to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making its current chart pattern a first-stage base. That's a positive sign since first-stage patterns are more likely to succeed than later-stage bases. The new buy point is 93.80.


PayPal pulled back Wednesday along with the rest of the market after the [Federal Reserve announced another rate hike](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-hike-despite-dow-jones-jitters-trump-tweets/). It had been testing support at its 10-week moving average since then, but failed to hold that line on Friday. The stock dove over 5% in heavy volume to close the week.


Despite that decline, PayPal's RS line remains within striking distance of a new 52-week high.


So see if the stock can retake the 10-week moving average in heavy volume in the coming days and weeks. And keep an eye on the general market to see if it can find a bottom and [launch a new uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970).

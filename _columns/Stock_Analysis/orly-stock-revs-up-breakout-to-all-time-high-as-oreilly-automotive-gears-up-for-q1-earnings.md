As fellow auto parts retailer **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) revs up a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) gears up for Q1 earnings. ORLY stock has already pulled into a [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/) to hit an all-time high.




O'Reilly Automotive earns a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-oreilly-automotive-orly.aspx), just behind **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), which scores a 96. **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)) (90) and AutoZone (87) also hail from the auto parts retailers and wholesales group, which ranks a poor 109 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.


In a sign of [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-track-institutional-demand-to-find-winners/) for top industry players, CPRT and ORLY stock made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-scoop-up-shares-in-tesla-apple-microsoft-tsm-and-more/).


A 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating further point to demand for O'Reilly. Copart sports a 1.7 up/down volume ratio and B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, while AutoZone (1.2, B) earns similar scores.


The [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) tracks buying and selling by mutual funds and other large investors over the past 13 weeks. The [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) covers 50 days of trading, dividing total volume on up days by total volume on down days. A number above 1.0 points to demand.


O'Reilly Automotive: 6,000 Stores And Counting
----------------------------------------------


Headquartered in Missouri, O'Reilly Automotive is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the U.S. and Mexico. In February, the company opened its [6,000th store](https://corporate.oreillyauto.com/cmsstatic/O'Reilly%20Automotive,%20Inc.%206000th%20Store%20Press%20Release.pdf), located in Gibson, Oklahoma.


Sales growth has remained steady over the last eight quarters, ranging between $3 billion and $3.8 billion. Revenue gains edged higher last year, from a 7% increase in Q1 2022 to an 11% gain in Q4. O'Reilly earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/profit-margins/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.


After low single-digit earnings growth in the first half of last year, the company managed to post double-digit EPS growth in Q3 and Q4. Analysts expect 11% earnings growth for Q1 2023 when O'Reilly Automotive reports earnings on April 26. Full-year estimates call for a 10% increase.


ORLY Stock Revs Up In Buy Zone
------------------------------


As Copart builds on its recent breakout and AutoZone clears a new buy point, O'Reilly Automotive has just pulled into a new buy zone.


ORLY stock stumbled after breaking out in February, pulling back to form its current [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle). The buy point is 874.04.


The auto parts retailer has just cleared that entry, but in light [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). O'Reilly rose just under 4% for the week. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) continues to rise but remains shy of a new 52-week high. As ORLY stock teases a fresh all-time high, look for heavy volume to confirm demand for the uptrend.

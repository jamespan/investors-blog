As **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) hits new highs and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) designs a new base, fellow semiconductor sector stock **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) is laser-focused on its own buy zone, making it one of the top IoT/5G stocks to watch.




Viewed on a daily stock chart, Qorvo is forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) after pulling back slightly from a breakout in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). Intel stock is showing similar action, but remains below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). Although it did flash a negative reversal Friday, [Taiwan Semiconductor stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/taiwan-semiconductor-q2-2020-tsm-stock/) is now extended beyond its buy zone after breaking out earlier.


Qorvo, Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel all hail from the same chipmaker industry group, which ranks No. 59 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

(FEM) for Wi-Fi 6, combining "the performance required to deliver HD/4K video with the efficiency needed for the Internet of Things (IoT)."


Qorvo has shown accelerating earnings and sales growth over the p ast two quarters. Revenue has gone from a 9% decline to a 16% increase, while EPS has jumped from a 13% decline to a 29% rise during that period.


While Qorvo stock did not make IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutuall-funds-invest-big-in-aapl-amzn-fb-nflx-googl-msft-adbe-zm-docu/), 36 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning shares in the stock.

In a further sign of strong [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), Qorvo sports an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and 1.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/).


Qorvo Stock Tests New Buy After Finding Support
-----------------------------------------------


Qorvo posted a solid breakout in early June, gapping up in strong volume. It soon hit resistance and pulled back, but found support at its 50-day line just as quickly.


The stock is now working on a new 119.04 entry as its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tries to reach a 52-week high. The new base is part of a base-on-base formation. The stock rose a little over 2% in Friday, bringing it to within 4% away of the buy point.


See if Qorvo can build on recent support and punch through that entry in volume at least 40% above average.

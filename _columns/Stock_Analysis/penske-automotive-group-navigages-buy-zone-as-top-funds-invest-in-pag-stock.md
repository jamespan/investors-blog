From the pandemic lows in 2020 through the current [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/), auto dealer **Penske Automotive Group** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)) nimbly navigated some rough terrain. But Thursday's stock market storm forced PAG stock to skid out of a buy zone once again.




On the bright side, strong institutional demand has helped Penske drive impressive market leadership, as evidenced by the performance of its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/). The stock currently holds a 1.4 [up/down volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) ratio. Plus, 28 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have reported owning PAG stock.


Penske also joined industry peers **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)), **Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)) and **Rush Enterprises** ([RUSHB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUSHB)) on the list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-shun-tech-stocks-scoop-up-medical-defense-oil-stocks/).


Penske Revs Up Expansion In The UK, U.S. And Canada
---------------------------------------------------


As a diversified international transportation services company, Penske Automotive Group is one of the world's premier automotive and commercial truck retailers. It operates dealerships principally in the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Japan.


In recent months, Penske expanded its footprint in the [UK](https://www.penskeautomotive.com/investors/news/news-details/2022/PENSKE-AUTOMOTIVE-GROUP-EXPANDS-PRESENCE-IN-THE-UNITED-KINGDOM/default.aspx), [Southern California](https://www.penskeautomotive.com/investors/news/news-details/2022/PENSKE-AUTOMOTIVE-GROUP-EXPANDS-PRESENCE-IN-SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA/default.aspx), [Texas](https://www.penskeautomotive.com/investors/news/news-details/2022/Penske-Automotive-Group-Opens-New-Honda-Dealership-in-Texas/default.aspx) and [Indianapolis](https://www.penskeautomotive.com/investors/news/news-details/2022/PENSKE-AUTOMOTIVE-GROUP-EXPANDS-PRESENCE-IN-INDIANAPOLIS/default.aspx).


Headquartered in Michigan, [Penske](https://www.penskeautomotive.com/home/default.aspx) is the largest retailer of commercial trucks in North America for longtime partner Freightliner, which is part of Daimler Truck North America. In February, the company acquired [TEAM Truck Centers](https://www.penskeautomotive.com/investors/news/news-details/2022/PENSKE-AUTOMOTIVE-GROUP-EXPANDS-PRESENCE-IN-INDIANAPOLIS/default.aspx), a Canada-based retailer of medium and heavy-duty Freightliner and Western Star commercial trucks.


Penske owns 28.9% of Penske Transportation Solutions, which manages a fleet of over 330,000 vehicles. The business provides transportation, supply chain, and technology services to North American fleets.


Penske Accelerates Growth With 113% EPS Gain
--------------------------------------------


Marking a second straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth, Penske Automotive Group posted a 113% EPS spike last quarter. Sales growth also jumped from 8% to 21%. Analysts expect flat earnings growth when the company reports in late July, but a 56% gain for the full year.


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Penske ties Group 1 Automotive for top ranking in the auto dealers industry. AutoNation and Rush Enterprises are also among the group leaders.


PAG Stock Tries To Steer Back Into Buy Zone
-------------------------------------------


While Penske hit some speed bumps along the way, its resilience to the brutal [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/) has been noteworthy, although it felt the bear market claws on Thursday.


On May 4, PAG stock briefly cleared a 114.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a third-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). After quickly retreating, the stock rebounded to hit a high on June 9 before skidding again. On May 10 and 20, Penske triggered the [7% to 8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/), but did manage to closer higher in each of those sessions.


Until Thursday, Penske had generally found support and shaken off resistance at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). But it has now slipped below that benchmark but managed to close the week above its 40-week line.


The RS line remains right around a new high, but has edged downward under market pressure.


Since most [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) during a bear market tend to fail, buying any stock, including Penske, is risky. But if the market indexes manage to find a bottom and begin to climb, Penske could be in the driver's seat for some nice gains.

Based in the heart of Silicon Valley, **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) is an analog chip designer that develops energy-efficient solutions for use in telecom infrastructures, cloud computing, the automotive industry and consumer applications. 


Key to the company’s competitive advantage is its proprietary BCD Plus process technology, which supports the integration of power devices at high levels on smaller semiconductors without significant power loss. 


Leader Among Top-Rated Chip Stocks
----------------------------------


Monolithic Power’s 98 Composite Rating earns it a spot among the top 5 stocks in the Electronics – Semiconductor Fabless industry group, along with **Maxlinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)).  


The group ranks No. 56 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, down from No. 18 three months ago. 


Although earnings and sales growth dipped slightly in Q4 to 19% and 15% respectively, Monolithic Power beat estimates for both the top and bottom lines . The company is set to report Q1 numbers on May 2. 


Monolithic has a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 18% and a 22% return on equity. The number of funds with a position in the stock has risen in each of the last three quarters. 


Will Monolithic Generate New Breakout?
--------------------------------------


Monolithic Power reset its base count last August, when it undercut the low in its prior pattern. 


The stock broke out in October and continued higher for several weeks in above-average volume, showing fund managers and other large investors were picking up shares.

It’s positive to see a former area of resistance turn into an area of support, allowing the stock to build stepping-stones and continue its climb.


The buy point is 65.36, 10 cents above the peak in the handle. Monolithic Power cleared that price on April 13, but volume was just 4% above average, well below the 40% or higher spike in trading you prefer to see on a breakout. 


The stock has since dropped back below the buy point, but volume has been tepid, which means, at least so far, large investors have not been selling aggressively. 


All eyes now turn to the company’s May 2 earnings report. See if the stock reports well and retakes the 65.36 entry in heavy volume.

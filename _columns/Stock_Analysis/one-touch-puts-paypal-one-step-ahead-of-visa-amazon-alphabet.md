As the battle for market share in the online payment processing space heats up, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) has found an edge over rivals **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)),  **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


The Holy Grail for retailers and online payment processors is to reduce the number of people who drop off during checkout without completing the purchase. And a new **comScore** ([SCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCOR)) study shows [PayPal's 87.5% conversion rate](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-leads-online-conversion-comscore-study/) far outstrips the 51.1% rate of Visa Checkout, its nearest rival. Other competitors such as Amazon and **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) were lumped into a single group with a 45.6% conversion rate.


A key factor in PayPal’s performance is its One Touch product, which debuted last year and enables payment authentication without requiring the shopper to enter a user name or password each time.


Powering Payments For Facebook, Starbucks
-----------------------------------------


PayPal has also been expanding its mobile offerings and its presence among millennials with Venmo, a digital payment app it picked up through its $800 million purchase of Braintree in 2013.


The Braintree acquisition, as well as PayPal’s buyout of Paydiant in 2015, have also led to [partnerships](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-at-the-heart-of-facebook-starbucks-mobile-payment-offerings/) with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)). The social media giant leverages Braintree to handle Uber requests within its Messenger app, while the Starbucks app includes PayPal as a way to make payments and reload digital cards.


Last week, PayPal announced it would offer PayPal Credit in the U.K., the first overseas launch of the service that helps finance purchases made through the PayPal network.

On Wednesday, the stock re-entered the 40.03-to-42.03 buy zone on volume that was below average but rising. As of Friday, it was still trading within that range. PayPal is set to report Q1 earnings on April 27.

When the market is choppy, large investors often look for stocks that have a solid track record of growth, show resilience when the indexes are volatile, and continue to pay a dividend.


**Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)), a real estate investment trust (REIT) whose name is an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, fits that bill.


The Arizona-based company, which went public in 2014, currently pays a dividend yielding 3.8% and has an 87% three-year growth rate for funds from operations (FFO) — the equivalent of earnings for REITs. Store's three-year sales growth comes in at a solid 67%.


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member also sports a 29% annual pretax profit margin, earning it a 96 Composite Rating and the No. 2 ranking within Finance — Property REIT industry group, just behind **Four Corners Property Trust** ([FCPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCPT)).


While earnings growth has slowed to an average gain of just 14% over the last three quarters, continued demand for shares is reflected in the stock's 1.3 Up/Down Volume Ratio and six consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership.


Bound For Breakout?
-------------------


Every stock eventually develops a 'personality,' in terms of its chart action. Some are wide and loose with patience-testing volatility, while others tend to trade in a tighter, more controlled manner. Store Capital is the latter.



Since completing a 37-week cup-with-handle last fall, the stock has generally traded right along its 10-week line, showing relatively tight weekly closes.


While forming its current flat base, the stock fell below the 10-week moving average, but the stock soon reclaimed that benchmark and the depth within the base is just 10%.


The potential buy point is 31.54, 10 cents above the peak on the left.


See if the market uptrend can hold its ground and if Store Capital can clear that entry in daily volume at least 40% above average.


On the daily chart, also look for the 10-day moving average to climb back above the longer-term 50-day line to show renewed technical strength.

**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is one of three network security software stocks on the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-alibaba-netflix-amazon-paypal-microsoft-salesforce/). And after resetting its base count, the cybersecurity leader is within striking distance of a new breakout.




In Q1, 27 of the best-performing funds picked up a total of approximately $100 million worth of shares in Palo Alto Networks.


These top money managers also picked up shares in fellow network security firms **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)). Twenty-six top funds invested an estimated total of $32 million in Fortinet during that period, while five funds bought approximately $18 million worth of CyberArk stock.


Along with **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), Palo Alto, CyberArk and Fortinet share top billing among network security stocks with the highest possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The industry group itself ranks in the top 10 of [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


Palo Alto Networks: Fundamental Analysis
----------------------------------------


A quick look at the ratings in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-palo-alto-networks-panw.aspx) clearly shows that Palo Alto shares many of the [common traits of big stock market winners](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


The Silicon Valley-based firm has posted four straight years of annual earnings growth, and has generated average yearly EPS gains of 53% over the last three years. Palo Alto Networks has increased revenue at an average annual pace of 30% during that same time.


The company also earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks the three key ingredients of long-term earnings growth: revenue, profit margins and return on equity. Palo Alto sports a solid 22.5% ROE and a strong 45.1% annual pretax profit margin. By comparison, CyberArk has a 21.4% profit margin and 18.7% return on equity, while Fortinet comes in with 23.5% margins and a 40% ROE.


Palo Alto has earned a spot on multiple [S&P 500-beating screens](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/), including the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). Fortinet is on the IBD 50 and IBD Big Cap 20, while CyberArk is currently on [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/).


Last month, Palo Alto announced the completion of its [purchase of Demisto](https://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2019/Palo-Alto-Networks-Completes-Acquisition-of-Demisto/), a leading cybersecurity firm specializing in security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR). Valued at $560 million in cash and stock, Palo Alto Networks says the deal will help "deliver immediate threat prevention and response for security teams."


Palo Alto Networks: Technical Analysis
--------------------------------------


As many stocks have done following the transition from a bear market in Q4 to a bullish uptrend this year, Palo Alto Networks stock has formed a new, shallower [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) after breaking out of a deeper consolidation. Known as a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), that can be constructive action, showing that the stock is shoring up support for a sustained climb.


Another positive sign is that while forming the deeper chart pattern, Palo Alto undercut the low in its prior base to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). So its current pattern is a first-stage formation.


The stock has found support at its 50-day line and is now eyeing a 260.73 entry. Palo Alto Networks closed Thursday's session 5% below the buy point. Look for the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) to hit a new 52-week high as the stock tries to clear the entry in volume at least 40% higher than normal to show investor conviction for a new breakout.

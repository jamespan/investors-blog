When the stock market makes a big move, as it did Monday, look to see which stocks are riding that wave and moving higher. Pay particular attention to those heading into buy zones with their Relative Strength lines on the rise.


Stocks that fit that bill Monday include familiar names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


One lesser-known company that had an even bigger day was **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)), which made IBD's latest list of [stocks near a buy zone](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/top-stocks-q3-earnings-due-facebook-blue-buffalo-commscope/) and rose nearly 6% to clear a 26.54 entry in volume 61% above average.


RealPage then bucked selling in the indexes on Tuesday to climb another 1.3%, leaving the stock at the upper limit of a 26.54 to 27.87 buy zone.



Leading Stock In Highly-Ranked Industry
---------------------------------------


While not a household name, RealPage is well-known within the housing and real estate market.


The Texas-based company provides full service rental property management solutions to over 12,000 real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other property owners and managers.


Across its client network, which manages over 11 million rental housing units and more than 200 million square feet of commercial office, retail, industrial and mixed use properties, RealPage process over 600 billion transactions annually.


The company's 97 Composite Rating ranks No. 2 within the specialty enterprise software group, just behind **Park City Group** ([PCYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCYG)) and ahead of **SPS Commerce** ([SPSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPSC)), Atlassian ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)).


The group ranks No. 32 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


The number of mutual funds with a position in RealPage has risen for seven straight quarters, and three typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).


Strong, But Slowing Earnings
----------------------------


Earnings growth came in at a robust 50% in Q2, but that marked the fourth consecutive quarter of slowing gains. But second-quarter sales growth jumped from 16% to 24%.


RealPage is expected to report Q3 numbers on Nov. 1.


For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 33%, followed by a 23% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

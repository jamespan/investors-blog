**OpenText** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)) develops content management software to help organizations manage, use and share business information.

  

Earlier this month, it announced the purchase of **Actuate** ([BIRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRT)), an intelligence and information software services firm, for about $330 million. That should help OpenText enhance its products with embedded analytics.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The company has posted three consecutive quarters of solid sales and earnings growth. The latest report for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which ends in June, was its strongest first quarter ever, with total revenue of over $453 million.

  

OpenText pays a dividend yielding 1.2% on an annualized basis and has a solid 27% return on equity. It earns a 97 Composite Rating.

  

While it has a mediocre C- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, its 1.4 up/down volume ratio indicates strong demand. And the number of funds that own OpenText shares has risen nicely in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

OpenText has had a good run since snapping out of a nearly two-year slump in April 2013.

  

Earlier this year, it formed a 22-week consolidation that showed 12 weeks of tight trading right along the 10-week moving average, a sign of institutional support.

  

It gapped up to break out of that base on July 31, after a big beat on earnings. It inched higher for several weeks, then began forming a flat base with a 58.81 entry.

  

Like several other leaders, OpenText broke out last month, but struggled to make a significant move. Volume was weak and the stock rose less than 3% before pulling back.

  

As the market has weakened, OpenText has fallen below the buy point. But with its strong fundamentals, OpenText may be one to watch if the market finds renewed strength.

When biotech companies like **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) put their drugs through extensive trials to gain FDA approval, they turn to clinical research firms like **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)).


 PRA Health is a leading contract research organization, and holds the No. 1 ranking within the medical research equipment and services industry group, ahead of **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), **IQVIA** ([IQV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IQV)), **Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)) and **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)).


Illumina soared into a buy zone last week, and despite [the big tech sell-off on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/financials-shine-but-nasdaq-rocked-as-tech-stocks-take-heat/), initially managed to keep climbing beyond the 214.44 buy point. But the genomics research leader took a hit Monday, falling 5% in heavy volume to close below the entry price.


While it's not unusual for a stock to pull back to the buy point after a breakout, a sudden reversal like that in volume is worrisome.


PRA Health also fell, but managed to find support at its 50-day line as it tries to complete a new flat base and keep adding to the big gains it's made since its 2014 IPO.


Accelerating Growth, Strong Institutional Demand
------------------------------------------------


Based in Raleigh, N.C., PRA Health has over 70 offices and more than 14,000 employees around the world. It sports a 49% three-year annual EPS growth rate and has posted two straight quarters of accelerating growth. Top-line gains have accelerated for three consecutive quarters.


Analysts expect a 45% increase in EPS for the current quarter and a 32% gain for the full  year. Analysts have revised higher both numbers.


Signs of demand for shares include a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rating-detects-institutional-buying-and-selling-in-stock/), 1.3 up/down volume ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Later-Stage Base And Market Uptrend On Trial
--------------------------------------------


PRA Health's flat base is part of a later-stage base-on-base and is showing an 84.48 entry.


As the Nasdaq and leading technology stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sold off last Wednesday, PRA Health also fell 1.6%, but volume was well below average, and the stock found support just above its prior 81.09 buy point.


It bounced back on Thursday with a 1.3% gain to close 2% below the buy point. After bouncing back from an earlier drop during the Friday's session, the stock closed the week above its 50-day line.


PRA Health was up early Monday morning, but reversed to close down 1.3%, leaving it now 5% below the buy point. See if it can maintain support at the 50-day moving average and rebound in stronger volume. Also look for the relative strength line to move up and get closer to new high ground.

**Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) provides products and services for the veterinary industry, water testing and dairy markets.

  

As IBD noted in the Dec. 26 [Managing for Success column](http://news.investors.com/management-managing-for-success/122614-732211-jon-ayers-idexx-laboratories-partners-with-veterinarians.htm) , Idexx allows employees to spend 20% of their time on their own pet projects. That led to a mobile app for vets that gives instant access to test results and the animal's diagnostic history.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

For seven quarters, earnings growth was fairly modest but quite steady, ranging from 9% to 11%. It jumped to 25% in Q3, with EPS topping analyst estimates by 15 cents. Sales growth edged higher to 13% and also beat estimates.

  

2014 earnings-per-share growth is expected to come in at 12%, then rise to 15% in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Idexx sports a strong 32% return on equity and a solid 97 Composite Rating.

  

The B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate institutional buying over the last 3 months and the number of funds that own the stock has been moving steadily higher in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

While Idexx is not a particularly explosive growth stock, it is up almost 50% since October 2013.

  

After selling off in July of last year, the stock stayed under the 10-week line for several weeks, bumping its head each time it tried to punch through.

  

But then Idexx soared higher in late October after reporting estimate-beating Q3 numbers.

  

It broke past the 140.10 buy point the following week, and rose just under 10% by mid-November.

  

Since then, the stock has been trading in a tight range for the last eight weeks, a sign of resilience in the face of the current market correction. That's also reflected in the relative strength line which has held its ground and remains near new high territory.

  

Idexx is currently working on a flat base as part of a first-stage base-on-base consolidation. It found good support at the 50-day line earlier this week.

  

On Tuesday, Idexx closed just below that benchmark, but near the top of its price range. Volume for the day was 46% above average, a sign large investors were stepping in to protect or add to their positions.

  

It moved higher on Wednesday and as of early Thursday morning was trading about 2% below the 153.99 buy point.

A multi-billion-dollar net worth isn't the only thing **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) CEO Warren Buffett and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) founder Mark Zuckerberg have in common.


Here's another connection: Facebook is the only social media and major tech stock currently on the "Warren Buffett Stock Screen," a list created by IBD sister company [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) based on the Sage of Omaha's stock-picking criteria.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and other top tech names failed to make the cut.


Zuckerberg's Big Bets Paying Off
--------------------------------


While Buffett is famous for generally steering clear of high-flying technology stocks, he's equally famous for focusing on well-run companies with positions of leadership within their industries. Facebook fits that bill.


The social media giant has a three-year EPS growth rate of 71%, a three-year sales growth rate of 54% and an annual pretax profit margin of 55.6%. That tops the margins for Alphabet (33.1%) and Apple (31%).


As last year's $32 billion buyout of Precision Castparts shows, Warren Buffett is no stranger to placing huge bets. Neither is Zuckerberg.


Facebook is starting to see the payoffs from Zuckerberg's multi-billion-dollar bets on [Instagram](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stretches-video-power-on-its-next-big-moneymaker/), WhatsApp and [Oculus VR](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oculus-rift-launches-will-sony-unveil-better-console-for-vr/) -- as well as from heavy investments in mobile advertising and new apps like [Facebook Messenger](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-messenger-becoming-a-swiss-knife-that-could-poke-apple/), which has over 800 million monthly users.


What's Missing From Facebook's Base?
------------------------------------


Chart patterns in individual stocks reflect what's happening in the general market. When the market is volatile and flashing seesaw action with several false starts and failed rallies, you're likely to encounter a lot of [double bottoms](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2) and base-on-base formations. Facebook's chart is a case in point.


[![Markup_FB](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Markup_FB-300x263.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Markup_FB.jpg)After breaking out last June, the stock started pulling back just a few weeks later. It [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) during the August flash crash when a new low undercut the low in the prior pattern.


It broke out in October but pulled back once again before rising at least 20% from the prior buy point. It did the same thing again in January, making the stock's three most recent consolidations all part of a first-stage base-on-base.


Facebook has shown tight trading while building the right side of its latest pattern and has stayed above its 10-week moving average. But one key element has been missing: volume.


Trading has been well below average, and that's reflected in the stock's D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Look for that to improve to at least a C or better to show rising buying by institutional investors as Facebook tries to clear a 117.69 buy point.

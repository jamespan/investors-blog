Legendary Fidelity fund manager Peter Lynch says you should invest in what you know. But he stresses that just seeing a long line at **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) or realizing everyone you know uses **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and has an **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone isn’t enough. You also need to research the company’s fundamentals.


If you enjoy beer, wine or spirits, **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) may be one stock to add to your watch list for further “research.”


While you might not know the corporate name, chances are you’ve heard of Constellation’s line of alcoholic beverages, including Corona beer, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky and Robert Mondavi wines.


No. 1 Within Alcoholic Beverages Industry
-----------------------------------------


Among its peers in the alcoholic beverages industry group, Constellation earns the top ranking with its 98 Composite Rating. The group itself ranks No. 15 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


On Jan. 7, the New York-b[![WEB-ISA01-012816-Chart](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Markup_STZ.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Markup_STZ.jpg)ased producer and distributor posted slowing growth for its fiscal 2016 third quarter, which ended Nov. 30. But it beat analyst estimates for both the top and bottom lines.


The company has a long track record of solid profitability, with a five-year annual EPS growth rate of 25%. Its three-year growth rate of 38% is even more impressive.


Despite this year’s stock market sell-off that pushed the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings for leaders like Amazon and Facebook down to the lowest-possible E, Constellation’s rating remains a solid B+, indicating moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.


 


The number of funds with a position in the stock has been rising in recent quarters, and four typically better-performing funds have a position in the stock, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and American Century All Cap Growth (TWGTX).


Also, Constellation made IBD’s latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, with 46 funds investing a total of approximately $169 million in the stock last quarter.


Resilience In Rocky Market
--------------------------


Constellation’s stock has been a steady climber, showing tight trading and consistent support at its 10-week line.


That trend has continued, even in the face of this year’s market sell-off. But there is a catch: if the stock forms a new chart pattern, it will be a later-stage base, which entails more risk.


But that said, the Relative Strength line shows the stock has been outperforming the general market. Also, volume has typically been higher on up weeks, which may mean fund managers are continuing to quietly accumulate shares.

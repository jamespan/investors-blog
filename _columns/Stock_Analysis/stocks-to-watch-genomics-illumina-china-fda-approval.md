More than 4 million new cancer patients are identified in China each year, and genomics leader **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) is trying to use its next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to improve their diagnosis and treatment.




In January, Illumina announced it will jointly develop [novel oncology and hereditary disease testing applications](https://www.illumina.com/company/news-center/press-releases/press-release-details.html?newsid=2324901) with Chinese clinical testing laboratory KingMed Diagnostics and seek China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) review and approval.


Already the first company to earn U.S. FDA approval for a next-generation sequencing instrument, Illumina is seeking to codevelop an integrated NGS system that will reach cancer patients across China through KingMed's clinical network that serves more than 8,000 Class 2 and Class 3B hospitals.

Profits Are In Illumina's Genes
-------------------------------


After a slowdown early last year, Illumina posted three straight quarters of rising earnings growth, including a jump from 14% to 69% in Q4.


Revenue gains have also accelerated during the same period, rising to 26% in the latest report.


Boosted by a 25% annual pretax profit margin and a 24% return on equity, the [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) earns an A for IBD's [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and ROE.


The San Diego, CA-based company holds the No. 3 rank within the medical research equipment and services industry group, just behind **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) and **Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)).


Institutional demand for Illumina's shares is reflected in its 1.2 up/down volume ratio and four consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 442 funds with an A- to A+ rating own shares in the stock.


With revenue of $778 million in just the fourth quarter, Illumina dwarfs three other [biotech industry stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) that have combined annual sales of under $50 million, but are [pioneering CRISPR technology](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-gene-editing-biotech-companies/), which builds on a project that sequenced the human genome: **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)), **Intellia Therapeutics** ([NTLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTLA)) and **Editas Medicine** ([EDIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDIT)).


Sequencing New Breakout?
------------------------


After a multiyear period of rough and rocky chart action, Illumina has been on the upswing since the beginning of last year.


Right after the stock completed a three-weeks tight pattern at the end of January, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all sold off sharply, bringing Illumina down with them.


But the genomics pioneer seems to have found its footing and is working on a new base as it tests support at its 10-week line.


The potential buy point is 249.07. On Monday, Illumina was down fractionally, putting it 9% below the entry.


Look for the relative strength line to reach new high ground and for volume on the upside to rise as Illumina tries to build the right side of the [cup-shaped pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/).

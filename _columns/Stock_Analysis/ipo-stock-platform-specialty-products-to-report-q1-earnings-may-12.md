Wall Street has not been in a forgiving mood during this Q1 earnings season. High profile names like **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) sold off sharply after reporting, and even top-rated stocks like Apple chip supplier **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) have run into resistance.

  

So it's in that market environment that 2014 IPO **Platform Specialty Products** ([PAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAH)) is getting ready to report earnings on May 12.

  

The Florida-based firm is a global, diversified producer of high-tech specialty chemicals used in a wide range of industries, including electronics, graphic arts and offshore oil production and drilling.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of flat or single-digit revenue growth, sales jumped 48% in Q4. Platform Specialty's earnings also have been on rise, increasing by 27% in the latest report.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to increase 73%, followed by a 33% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

The company's return on equity is just 6%, but its annual EPS Growth Rate is a strong 81%. Overall, Platform Specialty Products earns a 96 Composite Rating and the attention of institutional investors.

  

It sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio and fund ownership has climbed higher in recent quarters.

  

As you like to see, two typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: Legg Mason Opportunity Trust C and Fidelity Contrafund .

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public in January 2014, Platform Specialty Products climbed higher until hitting resistance just under $29 in June.

  

That sent the stock into a 10-month slump, but along the way it [reset the base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) when it undercut the low in a prior base, making its current cup-with-handle a first-stage pattern.

  

The stock broke past the 27.27 buy point last month, but like many other stocks, failed to gain much traction and is still hovering around that entry price.

  

With the market now in a correction and Platform Specialty Products set to report Q1 earnings on May 12, it is not an ideal time to buy. But if the market outlook picks up and the company posts good numbers next week, it could be one to watch.

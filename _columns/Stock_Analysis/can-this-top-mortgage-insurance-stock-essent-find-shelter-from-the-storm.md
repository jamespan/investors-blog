With the market under pressure, even top-rated stocks like **Essent** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) feel the heat. But if the indexes hold on and rebound, the private mortgage insurer may put a down payment on a new breakout.


Through subsidiaries including Essent Guaranty and Essent Reinsurance, the company offers private mortgage insurance for single-family mortgage loans in the U.S. and provides private capital to lenders to mitigate mortgage credit risk.


Boosted by strong three-year annual growth rates for both earnings (70%) and sales (67%) and an exceptional annual pretax profit margin of 64.6%, Essent holds the No. 1 rank within the property, casualty and title insurance industry group.


Essent's performance has earned it a spot on both the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) lists of top-performing growth stocks.


But individual stocks don't trade in a vacuum. Strength or weakness in the general market can significantly impact a stock's performance.


The [current outlook for the general market](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/) stands at "uptrend under pressure," meaning it's time to maintain a defensive posture and be cautious about making any new buys.


Plus, Essent is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 4, which could send the stock sharply higher or lower, as we saw this week with **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)).


Searching For Support
---------------------


Essent broke out of a cup-with-handle Aug. 4. An alternative entry formed at 27.87. Those can be riskier, and indeed the stock immediately started to form a new base.



Within the bottom of current formation, Essent showed tight weekly closes and support at its 10-week moving average.


Such action is healthy, and the stock's 1.5 up/down volume ratio and two straight quarters of rising fund ownership points to institutional demand.


But with the indexes struggling, Essent has also pulled back and is testing support at its 50-day line.


See if the market can rebound and Essent can deliver strong Q3 earnings.

During a market correction, savvy investors build a list of stocks to watch that could lead in the next uptrend. A good starting point is to look at new IPO stocks with explosive earnings growth. Names like **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), **PetIQ** ([PETQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETQ)) and **Vici Properties** ([VICI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VICI)) fit that bill.




To make the list below, each stock must have consensus analyst estimates calling for at least 100% growth in its next earnings report.


The stocks must also trade at least 200,000 shares per day on average, and have an 80 or higher [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/). The list is also restricted to [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) that went public in 2017 or 2018.

IPO Stocks To Watch
-------------------


Several stocks on the list, such as PetIQ, **Livent** ([LTHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTHM)) and **National Vision** ([EYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EYE)), have retreated during the current market sell-off. Such behavior is not unusual during a market correction, especially for new issues, which can be volatile.


But given their exceptional earnings growth, they're still worth keeping on your radar. PetIQ, for example, has posted three straight quarters of explosive earnings growth for an average gain of 2,866%.


So although these stocks are not currently near a proper buy point, you don't want to ignore companies posting those kinds of numbers. Continue to track them and see they display the type of [telltale traits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/) and [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) that launch big new moves.


Brazil-based payment services provider PagSeguro appears to be basing as it tests support at its 10-week line. The company has delivered average EPS growth of 223% over the past three quarters.


Real estate investment trust (REIT) Vici Properties has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), which has a proven track record of [beating the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/). In Q2, it posted 3,700% earnings growth, along with a 4,241% rise in sales. The Las Vegas-based company also pays a dividend, currently yielding 5.2% on an annualized basis. The stock is testing a 21.91 buy point in a early stage flat base.



Although eyeglasses retailer and manufacturer National Vision has fallen below its 10-week line, it's working on a consolidation showing a 46.73 entry. It posted 133% earnings growth in the second quarter, and analysts expect a 50% rise in Q3.


**Viomi Technology** ([VIOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIOT)) is a [Chinese stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) that develops and sells [Internet of Things](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) (IoT)-enabled smart home products. While it trades over 1 million shares a day on average, its share price is under 10. But that can change quickly. Viomi appears to be forming a new base as the stock market tries to find its footing.


Best IPO Stocks For New Market Uptrend?
---------------------------------------


It's impossible to know with any degree of certainty when a new market rally will begin or which stocks will lead it. Instead of making predictions, focus on proven [signals that indicate a market rebound](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) and the [seven characteristics of winning stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Keep in mind also that many of the best stocks tend to make their biggest moves within several years of their initial public offerings. So if the market is able to launch a strong new uptrend in the coming weeks, the fast-growing stocks to watch on this list may be poised to ride, and even lead, that wave.

What do stock market watchers think of the prospects for **TransDigm Group** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG))? As [American Trade Journal](http://www.americantradejournal.com/analyst-price-target-on-transdigm-group-incorporated-nysetdg/6160849/) reported, seven analysts rate the stock a strong buy.

  

While TransDigm pulled back last week in the face of selling pressure in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the maker of aerospace components stands to benefit from [record aircraft orders](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/120815-784332-transdigm-moves-up-the-aerospace-food-chain-via-acquisitions.htm) for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Airbus** ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)).

  

TransDigm's pending buyout of helicopter hoist-and-winch manufacturer **Breeze-Eastern** ([BZC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZC)) will also provide additional inroads into the defense aerospace market, as the Pentagon increases spending on military aircraft to address the rise of ISIS and continued unrest in the Middle East.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

For the quarter ended in September, TransDigm beat estimates and posted accelerating growth for both the top and bottom lines.

  

Analysts expect 18% EPS growth in the fiscal year ending next September, followed by a 12% rise in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher by analysts.

  

TransDigm's 1.5 up/down volume ratio and rising fund ownership points to institutional demand for the stock.

  

But its 87 Composite Rating is below the 90 or higher score you'd prefer, and puts TransDigm in the No. 9 slot in the aerospace and defense group, behind Breeze-Eastern, **Orbital** ([OA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OA)), **Huntington Ingalls** ([HII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HII)) and Boeing.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

TransDigm is working on a cup-with-handle pattern with a 238.61 entry.

  

As the stock pulled back along with the general market last week, volume was below average but rising. A continued rise in downside volume would point to more serious selling.

  

TransDigm is testing support at its 10-week moving average, while that 10-week benchmark tries to stay above the 40-week line.

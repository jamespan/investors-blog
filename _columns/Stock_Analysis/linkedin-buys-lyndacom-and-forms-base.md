Start your search for the best stocks by asking: [What are top mutual fund managers buying?](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/040715-746777-linkedin-among-new-buys-of-top-funds.htm)Â In the first quarter, 32 of the best-performing mutual funds invested an estimated $121 million in **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), earning the stock a spot on IBD's latest list of [New Buys By Top-Performing Stock Funds](http://news.investors.com/PDF/mutbuys_040715.pdf).

  

Fellow social media stocks **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) did not make the cut.

  

On April 9, [LinkedIn said that it was buying Lynda.com](http://news.investors.com/041015-747453-linkedin-wants-an-education.htm) for $1.5 billion. It hopes to leverage the online education site's 6,000 online courses to boost revenue from LinkedIn's 350 million users.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has been strong and steady, ranging from 44% to 47% over the past five quarters. And earnings growth accelerated in Q4 from 33% to 56%. The company is expected to report Q1 numbers on April 30.

  

LinkedIn's 9% return on equity is on the light side, and its Internet content industry group currently ranks a lowly 133. But overall, the stock earns a 93 Composite Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

From September through January, LinkedIn kept forming new bases as it [hit resistance](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735785&sourceid=735786) around the 230-240 price range. But the low in each subsequent base was higher than the low in the prior pattern, which means that support for the stock was shoring up.

  

LinkedIn bolted higher on Feb. 5, when it reported Q4 results. It later pulled back but found support right around the prior area of resistance.

  

However, LinkedIn isn't out of the woods just yet. As it works on a flat base with a 276.28 buy point, the stock has been testing resistance at its 10-week line. See if that benchmark becomes a ceiling of resistance or a floor of support.

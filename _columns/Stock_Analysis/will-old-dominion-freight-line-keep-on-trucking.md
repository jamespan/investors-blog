**Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) is the fifth largest less-than-truckload carrier in the U.S. LTL carriers charge premium prices for smaller loads that don't require a full 48- or 53-foot trailer.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth had been in the single or low double digits for several quarters, but jumped to 19% in Q2. Earnings growth also accelerated from 13% to 26%. Old Dominion's three-year annual growth rate is a solid 48%.

  

Overall, it scores the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and earns a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Old Dominion broke out of a deep, first-stage cup with handle in late 2011, then formed an additional lengthy consolidation in 2012.

  

That launched a steady climb in tight trading, with good support along its 10-week moving average.

  

It's now working on a third-stage flat base. The stock corrected only 6%, a bullishly tight range.

  

While later-stage bases are more prone to failure, the stock showed strength during the recent market correction, trading in a narrow band and climbing back above its 10-week line. Old Dominion also flashed a week of heavy-volume accumulation after reporting Q2 numbers July 31 as it built the right side of the pattern.

  

On Friday, the stock poked above the 65.45 buy point but closed below it as the broad market reversed. Volume was well below average, but the relative strength line has moved into new high ground.

  

If Old Dominion does break out, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than normal that day. You want to see heavy volume kick in to show large investors are buying aggressively.

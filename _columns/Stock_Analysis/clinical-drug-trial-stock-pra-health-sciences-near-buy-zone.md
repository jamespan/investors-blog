It's a long and costly process for [Big Pharma and biotech stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/) like **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Abbot Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) to get Food & Drug Administration approval for new drugs. And leading clinical research organization (CRO) **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) helps drugmakers get their new treatments to market by conducting clinical trials.




Based in Raleigh, N.C., PRA Health Sciences has operations in more than 80 countries and has conducted over 3,500 clinical studies and nonclinical projects, leading to FDA or international regulatory approval for over 75 drugs.


The company was just named [Best CRO in Asia](http://investor.prahs.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253891&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2336523) by the Phar-East Pharma and Biotech Festival, its fourth such award since 2013.

Top Medical Research Stock
--------------------------


With a 97 Composite Rating, PRA Health Sciences holds the No. 1 ranking within the medical research equipment and services industry group, ahead of [IBD 50 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), which was featured in the [Feb. 26 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/stocks-to-watch-genomics-illumina-china-fda-approval/), just before its March 9 breakout. Illumina is still trading within buy range.


PRA Health Sciences is setting up its own possible breakout move as it builds a later-stage flat base showing a 96 buy point. With its relative strength line rising but still below new-high ground, the stock is 6% shy of the entry.



Abbot Laboratories, which made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](http://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-bof-boeing-adobe-schwab/), is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 64.70 entry. Its relative strength is near new high ground, a sign of stock market leadership.


[IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals broke out in January, but then [triggered the 8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) after falling back below the initial 167.96 entry. Vertex has since rebounded and is now 4% above the original buy point.


AbbVie is building a later-stage cup with handle showing a 122.10 entry, but the stock has been weakening in the past few days. It was about 6% below the buy point Friday at midday.


Strong Demand Among Top Mutual Funds
------------------------------------


PRA Health Sciences has seen eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership, and 117 mutual funds with an A- or higher rating own shares in the stock, including **Fidelity Contrafund** ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), which holds approximately 1.3% of the company's shares.


PRA Health has posted three quarters of rising earnings growth, with an increase from 38% to 46% in Q4. Revenue gains have accelerated in each of the last four reports, rising from 10% to 39% during the past five periods.

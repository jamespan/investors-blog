With a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), **M/I Home**s ([MHO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHO)) earns top billing in the [homebuilder industry group](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/). The Ohio-based maker of luxury homes and other residential abodes for first-time homebuyers and empty nesters is just 1% shy of a new breakout.


Its 98 rating means M/I Homes is outperforming 98% of all stocks in the IBD database based on the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), and **Lennar** ([LENB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LENB)) round out the top five stocks in the industry. The group ranks a middling, but rising No. 84 out of the [197 groups IBD tracks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/understanding-the-link-between-industry-groups-and-institutional-investors/).


As M/I Homes sets up a potential new move, Lennar and NVR are also building bases that could launch new breakouts.


Rebounding Earnings Growth Lifting M/I Homes Stock
--------------------------------------------------


After reporting earnings growth ranging from 42% to 47% for three quarters, M/I Homes saw its earnings per share decline by 3% in the March quarter. But the company bounced back to a 4% gain in Q2, then a 28% spike in Q3.


The homebuilder is expected to report full-year and fourth-quarter earnings in early February. Analysts expect earnings to rise 18% for 2019 and 8% in 2020. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


M/I Homes Builds New Foundation For Potential Climb
---------------------------------------------------


M/I Homes broke out of a 65-week-long [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/)Â base in July. It bolted nearly 15% higher during the week ended June 26 after reporting earnings.


The stock has continued to hold and build on those gains. After its Q3 report, M/I Homes stock spiked again, jumping nearly 13% when the company posted earnings Oct. 23.


M/I Homes, now working on a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 45.60 entry, is trading just 1% below that buy point. Trading has been relatively tight, with the stock showing solid support above the 10-week line. As M/I Homes tries to launch a new move, see if its relative strength line can reach a new 52-week high to further confirm stock market leadership.


In Friday's session, the stock broke past the buy point, but reversed to close below it.

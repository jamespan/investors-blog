While most [solar stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) like **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) and **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) have been struggling, wind and solar energy stock **NextEra Energy Partners** ([NEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEP)) may be getting ready to blow past a new buy point.


Based in Florida, NextEra owns and manages contracted clean and renewable energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows. In addition to its interests in wind and solar energy projects in the U.S., NextEra also has seven natural gas pipelines serving power producers and commercial and industrial customers in the Eagle Ford Shale and other parts of Texas. Its NET Mexico Pipeline provides natural gas transportation for U.S.-sourced shale gas to Mexico.

Solar Energy Stocks To Watch
----------------------------


NextEra has delivered average earnings growth of 289% over the last three quarters, including a 496% gain in its latest report on July 25. Analysts are looking for a whopping 4,800% gain in the third quarter.


Sales growth has been much more tepid, ranging from 2% to 5% over the last four quarters. But longer term, NextEra has generated a three-year annual revenue growth rate of 27%. It sports a solid 34.2% annual pretax profit margin, but a weak 2% return on equity.


NextEra also pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.5% on an annualized basis.


Signs of institutional demand include a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 up/down volume ratio. But note that the number of funds with a position in the stock dipped last quarter from 162 to 159.


NextEra's 87 Composite Rating earns it the No. 3 spot among alternative energy stocks. **Ameresco** ([AMRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMRC)) and **TPI Composites** ([TPIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPIC)) hold the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively.


Next Breakout Among Solar Energy Stocks?
----------------------------------------


NextEra is working on a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. On Monday, the stock rose 1.8% to 47.97, putting it just 1% below the 48.85 buy point. Volume was below average.


Note how the bottom of the current chart pattern formed right around the 45.08 entry in its prior pattern. Such behavior is a sign the stock may be forming a steppingstone to help it keep climbing higher.


See if the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) can reach a new 52-week high as NextEra tries to [complete the base and breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).



Ameresco and TPI Composites are both extended from recent breakouts. While TPI was down Monday, Ameresco rose over 5% in heavy trade.

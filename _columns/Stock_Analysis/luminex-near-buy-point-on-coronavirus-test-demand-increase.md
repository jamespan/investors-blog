As coronavirus test demand increases, drug discovery and clinical diagnostics firm **Luminex** ([LMNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMNX)) is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for high-volume Covid-19 testing. Luminex stock is near a new buy point and all-time high.




On July 22, [Luminex announced it has submitted an Emergency Use Authorization](https://investor.luminexcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/luminex-files-emergency-use-authorization-expanded-nxtag) (EUA) request to the FDA. The request is for an expanded version of Luminex's NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel to include the SARS-CoV-2 virus for high-throughput Covid-19 testing.


Earlier this month, the FDA granted Luminex Emergency Use Authorization for the company's xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG Assay. That enables clinical labs to use this serology assay to identify the presence of antibodies in people who have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19.


Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Luminex has zeroed in on expanding capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing across all of its molecular platforms.


As Luminex looks to gain FDA approval, Luminex stock is forming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) showing a 38.23 buy point.

Luminex Q2 Earnings: Analysts Expect 180% Growth
------------------------------------------------


Expectations are high for Luminex, with analysts looking for 180% EPS growth when the company reports on Aug. 4. In Q1, the Austin, Texas-based clinical research firm delivered 114% growth in EPS, based on comparisons with the prior-year quarter, which showed a loss of 7 cents a share.


With a 94 Composite Rating, Luminex holds the No. 8 spot among its peers in the medical research equipment and services group. **Charles River Laboratories** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) and **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) are among the other leaders in the lofty No. 17-ranked industry among IBD's 197 industry groups.


Charles River Labs, which was featured in the [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/charles-river-labs-crl-stock-tests-new-buy-zone/) earlier in July, broke out on July 15. Thermo Fisher broke out in late April and has been moving sharply higher since the end of June.


Boosted by an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and three quarters of rising fund ownership, Luminex hopes to join Charles River Labs and Thermo Fisher among the list of recent [breakout stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/).


Luminex Tests Support For Cup-With-Handle Breakout
--------------------------------------------------


With earnings due next week, Luminex stock has a chance to clear the 38.23 entry. The stock was up more than 2% Thursday, but eased back on Friday. Luminex ended the week 5% shy of the buy point as it came off its lows in the final hour of trading.


Look for Luminex to break past the entry price in volume at least 40% higher than normal.


Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is well below a 52-week high, so look for that line to turn sharply higher to show Luminex is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.

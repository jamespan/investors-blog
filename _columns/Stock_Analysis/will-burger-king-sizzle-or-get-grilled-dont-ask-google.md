 Despite facing a 'Zinger' from **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM))-owned KFC and backlash from a TV commercial tied to Google Home gadgets, Burger King-parent **Restaurant Brands International** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR)) may be getting ready to serve up a new breakout.
While you can still hold the pickles and hold the lettuce, the company learned that special orders *do* upset us, with 'us' being some of the people who [had their Google voice-controlled speakers triggered by a Burger King TV commercial](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/burger-king-has-a-whopper-of-an-order-for-your-google-assistant/).


A Burger King employee's call of "OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?" within the ad prompted nearby voice-activated devices from Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) to read the Wikipedia entry for the iconic burger.


Meanwhile, rival KFC is taking aim at Burger King and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) with the U.S. launch of The Zinger, a chicken sandwich already popular in over 120 other countries.


KFC says The Zinger will be made in-house daily, using domestically-raised, fresh (i.e. not frozen) chicken with no antibiotics.


Hortons Hears A Whopper
-----------------------


Restaurant Brands International was formed in 2014 through the merger of Burger King and Canadian coffee giant Tim Hortons. Earlier this year, Restaurant Brands added Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen to its line up.


Across all three brands, the company now has more than 23,000 locations in over 100 countries. And eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada are poured in a Tim Hortons restaurant.


Restaurant Brands holds the No. 2 spot within the No. 21-ranked restaurants group, with a 95 Composite Rating.


**Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), **Cheesecake Factory** ([CAKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAKE)), **Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) and **Ruth's Hospitality** ([RUTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUTH)) round out the top five stocks in the industry.


While Restaurant Brands failed to join Dave & Buster's and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) on IBD's latest list of [new buys by top mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/top-funds-new-stock-buys-chips-pizza-movies/), it has shown signs of institutional demand, including an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


The company boasts a three-year annual revenue growth rate of 81%, but sales gains have slowed to 5% in each of the last two quarters.


Earnings have fared better. Boosted by a 31% annual pretax profit margin and 44% return on equity, Restaurant Brands has posted 36% average EPS growth over the last three quarters.


The company is expected to report Q1 numbers on April 24.


Consensus analyst estimates call for a 15% rise in earnings this year, followed by a 32% gain in 2018.


One Breakout, Coming Up?
------------------------


Since coming out of a 46-week long cup with handle last summer, Restaurant Brands has been edging higher, forming steppingstones in the form of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/tag/chart-patterns-base-on-base) along the way.


The stock is now working on the fourth installment of that first-stage formation, showing tight, healthy trading and support at its 10-week line.



The relative strength line is floating near new high ground, a bullish sign ahead of a potential breakout.


On Tuesday, the stock was down slightly during the session, but found support at the 10-day moving average and edged higher in light volume for a fractional gain.


Restaurant Brands was up over 1% Wednesday morning, bringing it within about 2% of the 58.08 buy point.


But keep in mind that it's risky to buy a stock just before it releases earnings. It's generally best to wait and see how the stock reports and how the market reacts.

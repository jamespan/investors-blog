5G stock **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) is looking to beam up a new breakout after teaming up with **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and its Facebook Connectivity initiative.




On Feb. 16, [MaxLinear and Facebook](https://investors.maxlinear.com/press-releases/detail/423/maxlinear-collaborates-with-facebook-connectivity-on) announced the collaboration to explore new ways to "bring fast, reliable internet to those without it."


The Facebook Connectivity program integrates silicon technologies and radio processing algorithms into Evenstar radio units (RUs). The [Evenstar](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/17/connectivity/evenstar/#:~:text=Evenstar%20is%20focused%20on%20building,networks%20in%20the%20OpenRAN%20ecosystem.&text=The%20program%20aims%20to%20bring,infrastructure%20supply%20chain%20for%20RAN.) initiative brings together mobile network operators and technology partners, such as **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)).


MaxLinear, a leading provider of radio frequency (RF) and mixed-signal integrated circuits, will integrate its MaxLin radio processing algorithms with Evenstar radio units (RUs) to enhance performance and reduce cost.


Focused on the critical goals for [5G](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-beyond-apple-5g-best-could-shift-from-smartphones-to-enterprise-plays/) radio networks, MaxLinear's RF transceivers aim to support wide signal bandwidths while simultaneously reducing system power consumption.


5G Stock MaxLinear Delivers High-Frequency Growth
-------------------------------------------------


Ahead of collaboration with Facebook, MaxLinear has been delivering a robust turnaround, posting triple-digit growth in its Feb. 3 earnings report.


The company reported 144% Q4 EPS growth, marking a third-straight quarter of acceleration. Sales also increased sharply, from a 20% decline in Q4 of 2019 to 178% gain in Q4 2020.


Analysts see that trend continuing, with consensus estimates calling for 119% earnings growth in 2021.


While neither FB stock nor MaxLinear made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-investing-semiconductor-stocks-cloud-stocks/), both stocks have shown signs of solid [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


MaxLinear earns an A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and has shown three straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) owns shares in MXL stock, and 29 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in the stock.


In fact, MaxLinear scores passing ratings for all the "Supply And Demand" metrics in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


While the Accumulation/Distribution Rating for FB stock has dropped to the lowest-possible E as it bases, six top funds on the IBD Mutual Fund Index have a stake in the social media giant. Also, an impressive 430 funds with an A+ rating have reported a position in FB stock.


Will MaxLinear Be Next 5G Breakout?
-----------------------------------


On its way to delivering two quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth, MaxLinear soared as much as 323% from its coronavirus lows in March 2020 before hitting an all-time high last month. Along the way, the [5G stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-stocks-beyond-apple-5g-best-could-shift-from-smartphones-to-enterprise-plays/) successfully tested support after two dips below its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/).


MaxLinear is now working on a second-stage [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), showing a 38.81 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's currently 4% below that entry.


The jagged look of the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) shows [volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/) in the stock. Look for the RS line to move toward a 52-week high as MXL stock targets a new breakout.


Note that just before and after its Q4 earnings report, MaxLinear flashed two weeks of above-average and rising volume. See if heavy buying by large investors continues to lift the stock into a new buy zone.


On Friday, MaxLinear closed the week with a nearly 6% gain in above-average and rising volume. It ended the session just 1% below the buy point.


Also keep tabs on FB stock, which failed to find support at its 10-week line on Friday, falling below that benchmark heavy trade. In addition to their work on the Facebook Connectivity project, look for MaxLinear and Facebook to launch new [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/).

The latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-big-on-aapl-stock-as-tech-stock-begin-rebound/) shows top money managers scooping up shares of **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)). Confirming demand for auto parts retailers, these institutional investors have also placed bets on industry peers **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), **Genuine Parts** ([GPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPC)), **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **LKQ** ([LKQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LKQ)).




With persistent [inflation](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-job-market-was-already-cooling-when-the-fed-panicked-heres-the-proof/), [bearish stock market sentiment](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/) and other economic concerns, many consumers are inclined to fix their old cars rather than buy new ones. That is one reason why the [Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) industry group ranks a strong No. 9 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


ORLY stock ranks second among its peers, sporting a 96 [Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) while GPC stock leads with a nearly perfect 98. Copart and AutoZone also hold Composite Ratings above 90 in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), meaning they are outperforming at least 90% of all stocks in IBD's database.

O'Reilly Automotive Takes Pole Position In Market Cap
-----------------------------------------------------


Founded in 1957 and led byÂ  flagship brand O'Reilly Auto Parts, O'Reilly Automotive operates over 5,800 stores in 47 U.S. states. Following its [acquisition of Mayasa Auto Parts](https://www.aftermarketnews.com/oreilly-automotive-to-acquire-mayasa-auto-parts-headquartered-in-guadalajara-mexico/) in 2019, it also runs 27 Mexican stores under the Orma Autopartes brand.


In terms of market capitalization, O'Reilly Automotive tops its peers with a $44.4 billion valuation. AutoZone is just behind, boasting a $41.1 billion market cap.


Copart ($26 billion), Genuine Parts ($21 billion) and LKQ ($13 billion) have reached blue-chip status, as well. Copart also earns a spot among [Warren Buffett stocks,](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks-investing-strategy-stock-screen/) based on criteria in sync with the Oracle of Omaha's investing style.


Earnings and sales growth have slumped in the single digits in the last two quarters, but O'Reilly has driven 28% average annual EPS growth in the last three years.


Analysts now expect below-trend results in 2023 and are forecasting just 12% earnings growth.


The company also sports an impressive Earnings Stability Rating of 5, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). (The lower the score, the more stable the earnings.)


In terms of sales, the company has averaged annual revenue gains of 13% over the past three years.


O'Reilly Automotive also holds an "A" [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. That, in combination with a track record of stable earnings growth, helps to rev up demand for ORLY stock among the best mutual funds.


ORLY Stock Flashes Soaring Relative Strength In Bad Market
----------------------------------------------------------


While [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) continue to stall out, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for O'Reilly Automotive has spiked to new highs.


ORLY stock jumped 3.5% in good [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) Wednesday, retaking its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/). O'Reilly is now testing support right at that critical support level to close out the week.


While it is risky to buy stocks in this type of environment, ORLY stock is trying to clear a 750.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


If successful, investors willing to take on the heightened risk should look for heavy volume on the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Higher and rising buy-side volume would show increased demand for ORLY stock.

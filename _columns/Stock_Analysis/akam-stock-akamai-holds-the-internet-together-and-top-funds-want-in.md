Akamai Picks Up Steam
---------------------


As tech stocks rebounded after last year's bear market, Akamai's fundamentals also turned around.

AKAM Stock Holds Tough — And Near Buy Point — In Roughed-Up Market
------------------------------------------------------------------


While the market indexes struggled to fight off the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-overkill-economic-outlook-index-plunges-to-record-low-in-ibd-tipp-poll/)-induced correction, AKAM stock continued to hold its ground. On Friday, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq popped, Akamai came off its lows to keep its new setup intact.


On Aug. 9, Akamai gapped up in huge volume after reporting second-quarter earnings the prior day. In a show of strength, the stock has held the bulk of those gains since, finding solid support.


On Sept. 20, AKAM stock briefly cleared a 107.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an early stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). Although it quickly slipped below that entry, the stock found support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It closed Thursday's market session right at that line.


The stock's [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) has trended sharply higher as its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) also continues to climb. That positive technical action in AKAM stock bodes well for the internet and cloud computing leader if the Nasdaq manages to resume the rally attempt it flashed at the end of last month.


AKAM stock fell early Friday climbed back to close at its 21-day line as the indexes jumped to end the week.

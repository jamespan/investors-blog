Today we'll look at **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)). Founded in Victor, New York in 1945 the company produces, imports, and markets beer, wine and spirits in the US, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Italy.

  

The company primarily offers its products to wholesale distributors and retailers offering numerous recognizable brands such as: Arbor Mist, Estancia, Kim Crawford, Modelo, Corona and Svedka Vodka.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings for the company have generally been heading in the right direction in recent quarters, with some strong double digit figures.

  

This is a welcomed change from the negative numbers it posted in three of its last eight reports.

  

Although revenue growth has dipped slightly, sales for Constellation Brands have been strong in recent reports, notching a triple-digit gain followed by two strong double-digit increases. That's a big leap compared to previous reports that ranged from 0% to11%.

  

Recent institutional buying has not been as strong as you would like to see.

  

Constellation's Up/Down Volume Ratio is just 0.8. A reading over 1 indicates demand.

  

And the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is C+ indicating a roughly equal amount of buying and selling by institutional investors in recent weeks.

  

Look for both these scores to improve in the days and weeks ahead.

  

On a brighter note, the number of funds owning the stock has been on the rise in recent quarters.

  

Also, four typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the Constellation Brands: Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX), American Century All Cap Growth Investment (TWGTX), MFS Growth A (MFEGX) and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX )

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In February 2013, Constellation Brands announced it had purchased the rights to sell Corona and Modelo brand beers in the US for $2.9 billion.

  

This came after Anheuser-Busch got some backlash about a lack of competition if it purchased Negro Modelo instead.

  

The Constellation deal sent the stock soaring 36%. From there the stock continued to climb, often using the 10-week line as support to edge higher.

  

The stock popped again in January of this year, after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results.

  

After quickly pulling back to form another base, the stock did manage to breakout, but ended up trading sideways before starting to form another consolidation.

  

Since the stock did not rise more than 20% from its previous pattern, the new formation is part of a second-stage, base-on-base consolidation.

  

It's a flat base with an ideal buy point of 86.01, found by adding 10 cents to the peak on the left.

  

Also keep in mind that Constellation Brands is scheduled to report its next round of earnings on June 30.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-constellation-brands-a-stz.aspx) shows Constellation carries a 94 Composite Rating, the best among the 17 stocks in its Beverages-Alcoholic industry group.

  

But the group is only ranked No. 114 among IBD's 197 groups.

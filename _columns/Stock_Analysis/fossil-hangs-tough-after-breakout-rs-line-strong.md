Watch and accessories maker **Fossil** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)) is trying to break out of a base, but is facing head winds amid a weak general market.

  

The stock formed a square-box base 1 with a potential buy point of 107.64.

  

Fossil rose past the buy point three times this week, but each time the stock gave up gains and closed in the lower half of its daily trading range.

  

It closed above 107.64 on Tuesday, although it trimmed a larger gain. On Wednesday it closed back below the buy point.

  

The stock's hesitation indicates that while buyers are powering its breakout attempt, there are also some sellers unloading shares.

  

Fossil's situation is not unusual. Stocks that try to break out while the market is still grinding through a correction will likely face resistance. It's similar to trying to swim upstream.

  

Fossil's Relative Strength line is at a brand-new high 2, which is a positive sign.

  

The stock has more positives as its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, up/down volume ratio and Relative Price Strength Rating are all at favorable levels.

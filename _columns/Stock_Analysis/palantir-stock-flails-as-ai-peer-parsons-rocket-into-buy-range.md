Hailing from the enterprise software industry, **Parsons** ([PSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSN)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) both tap artificial intelligence to help drive the future of the defense, intelligence and critical infrastructure markets. But while [PLTR stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/) has stumbled at the start of 2024, [Parsons stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-parsons-psn.aspx) rockets into into buy range.




Institutional demand for both of these AI leaders remains strong. Parsons and Palantir both made this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/msft-stock-leads-new-buys-by-best-mutual-funds-this-sector-sees-strong-demand/).


But Parsons stock currently has the upper hand on Palantir in certain metrics, including [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). PSN's 97 rating slightly edges out the 96 grade for PLTR stock.

Parsons Targets Breakout As Palantir Stock Regroups
---------------------------------------------------


Featured in this column Nov. 20 while launching a breakout, [PLTR stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/palantir-takes-ai-into-orbi-as-pltr-stock-spies-a-breakout/) then fizzled to close out the year. Palantir now trades below its 50-day moving average. Also note that its 21-day exponential moving average has been on a downward slope, falling back below the 50-day benchmark.


Palantir perked up in recent days, but continues to hit resistance at its 21-day line.


Meanwhile, Parsons stock has just shot into buy range, clearing a 64.63 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a first-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase). It closed out the week with a seventh straight up day.


PSN remains above both its [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/),


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for PLTR stock cratered as Palantir floundered at the end of last year. The RS line for Parsons has moved sideways over the last month, but has begun curling upward.


Parsons Taps AI To Deliver Combat Advantage
-------------------------------------------


To deliver a combat advantage to warfighters operating at the tactical edge, [Parsons uses AI](https://www.parsons.com/2023/12/parsons-merges-artificial-intelligence-to-deliver-combat-advantage/) to combine combat-tested technologies with historically challenging Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) capabilities.


The U.S. Army has integrated this solution into live events. The technology assists soldiers in developing courses of action for missions using live, virtual, and simulated sensors and intelligence data.


$292 Million In New Deals, Awards Boost PSN Stock
-------------------------------------------------


On Dec. 19, Parsons announced a [classified contract](https://www.parsons.com/2023/12/parsons-awarded-250-million-classified-contract/) for continued work in support of the U.S. government. The deal is valued at $250 million. It has a base period of one year with four one-year options.


On Jan. 8, Parsons said that the company also received a [$21 million task order](https://www.parsons.com/2024/01/parsons-secures-21-million-task-order-to-advance-nnsa-infrastructure/) by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Infrastructure. The task order is for design and construction management support at Los Alamos National Laboratory and has a three-year period of performance.


Parsons also announced a $21 million award on the Camp San Luis Obispo Munitions Response Site 05 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the Los Angeles District. With Parsons serving as a subcontractor, the five-year contract is new work for the company.

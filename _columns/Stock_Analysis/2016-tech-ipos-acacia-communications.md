Three trends are driving institutional demand for new issue **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)): the continuing cloud computing revolution, rising strength in the tech IPO market and four straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth.


Founded in 2009 with an IPO in May, Acacia develops high-speed interconnect modules for cloud infrastructure operators and communication service providers.


Demand for Acacia's products is poised to continue growing as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and other tech giants keep [increasing demand for cloud computing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-alphabet-amazon-fuel-strong-growth-in-cloud-spending/). Spending on the cloud is expected to rise 15% this year to $49.7 billion.


Following successful public offerings this year from Acacia, **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Cotiviti** ([COTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COTV)), the upcoming debut of [Japanese messaging company Line](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tech-ipo-market-ready-for-blockbuster-offering-from-japans-line/) is expected to give the tech IPO market another boost.


Acacia's Q1 sales growth of 79% earns it a spot among the four stocks on IBD's [Tech Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/tech-leaders/) with the [biggest year-over-year quarterly gains](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/tech-leaders/4-top-tech-stocks-with-biggest-sales-gains/), along with **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) (108%), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) (63%) and Facebook (52%).


The Massachusetts-based company has also posted triple-digit earnings growth in seven of the last eight quarters. It's expected to release Q2 numbers -- its first earnings report since going public -- around the end of July.


Acacia's 99 Composite Rating ranks No. 1 among its peers in the Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group, and institutional demand for shares is reflected in its 1.9 up/down volume ratio. The stock hasn't been trading long enough to have an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771), which tracks institutional buying and selling over the last 13 weeks.


IPO Base Breakout: Take Two
---------------------------


Acacia went public on May 13 at 23, then nearly doubled in price within five weeks.


The stock broke out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-can-be-short/) with a 43.20 entry during the week ended June 17, but it then sold off and fell back below the buy point as the Brexit vote rattled the market.


Over the last two weeks, Acacia has rebounded, and on Wednesday it closed just below the old entry. Early Thursday morning, the stock jumped back into the 43.20-45.36 buy zone.

When **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) initiated coverage on **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) last month, it also included the so-called Twitter of China on its list of top picks among Chinese Internet stocks, along with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Ctrip.com International** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)).


Weibo is a spin-off from Chinese Internet portal **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), which still has a controlling interest in the company. Prior to Weibo's 2014 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm), Alibaba took an 18% stake in the popular micro-blogging platform as a way to compete with rival Tencent and its WeChat messaging service.


Two Catalysts For Growth
------------------------


2015 was Weibo's first full year of profitability, and the company has posted five straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. Sales growth has also been strong, ranging from 39% to 48% over the last four quarters with a boost from two favorable trends:


* **Social Media As Marketing Tool:** Weibo's ad revenue has been rising as China's small- and medium-size businesses increasingly use social media to promote their products.
* **The Rise Of Mobile:** Weibo's monthly active users reached 236 million in December, with 83% using [smartphones or other mobile devices](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/weibo-growing-fast-as-mobile-use-surges/). Mobile usage drove 65% of fourth quarter revenue.


Is Weibo Following Facebook's Path?
-----------------------------------


Like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and other new issues that took a while before they got rolling, Weibo has struggled since going public just under two years ago.


But the stock has recently shown signs of institutional accumulation in the right side of its base, including two up weeks in heavy volume earlier this month. Weibo also sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating heavy buying by fund managers and other large investors over the last three months.


The stock is working on a base with a 20.66 buy point but may form a handle to create an earlier entry.

While Bitcoin is the poster child for the [cryptocurrency boom](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-news-and-trends/), the blockchain technology behind it is the real revolution. And a new partnership with blockchain solution provider Ripple may help fuel a new breakout for **Fleetcor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)).









 
 
 As a leading provider of commercial payment solutions for fleet managers and other businesses, Fleetcor is among the top-rated leaders in the credit card and payment processing industry group, which has seen strong recent breakouts from **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), a Brazil-based payment technology provider that has an earned a spot on IBD's [IPO Leaders list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).
Creating A Ripple With Blockchain?
----------------------------------


Headquartered in Georgia, Fleetcor works with over 800 partners to provide specialty payment solutions, providing fleet cards for fuel, food cards and corporate lodging discount cards. Fleetcor serves over 500,000 commercial accounts and millions of cardholders across the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, Africa and Asia.


Earlier this month, [Fleetcor announced it was launching a pilot program with Ripple](http://www.fleetcor.com/news_press_release.htm?reqid=2335586). Under the agreement, Fleetcor-owned Cambridge Global Payments, which processes over $20 billion in B2B cross-border payments each year, will "pilot the use of XRP, the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger, in payment flows through xRapid, Ripple's solution for on-demand liquidity."


50% Profit Margin
-----------------


The specialty payment solutions business has been especially profitable for Fleetcor, which sports a 50% annual pretax profit margin. It also has a strong 23.6% return on equity.


Fleetcor's numbers stack up well against Square (5.2% profit margin, 16.9% ROE), PayPal (23.3%, 15.1%) and PaySeguro (13.6%, 64.9%). Credit card giant Mastercard has even stronger performance, with a 53.6% profit margin and 88.2% return on equity.


In Q4, Fleetcor showed a nice jump in earnings growth from 14% to 27%. Revenue gains have ranged from 18% to 30% over the last five quarters.


Institutional demand for shares is reflected in the stock's 1.5 up/down volume ratio and B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Also note that Fleetcor saw a solid spike in fund ownership last quarter, from 831 funds to 865.


Several top-rated mutual funds own shares in Fleetcor, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), MFS Growth ([MFEGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFEGX)) and Baron Asset Retail ([BARAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BARAX)).


Blockchain Breakout?
--------------------


Fleetcor sold off sharply in early February as the Nasdaq, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 went through a short-lived correction. But the stock has moved back above its 10-week moving average and is now within 2% of the 213.84 entry in a second-stage flat base. OnTuesday, the stock fell just under 1% to 207.80.


Fleetcor's relative strength line is still within striking distance of new high ground.



While PaySeguro and Square are extended from their recent breakouts, PayPal is working on a later-stage base while testing support at its 10-week line. Mastercard is also extended from a breakout in early January, but it did recently clear a [three-weeks tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) and is within buy range from that 179.27 entry.

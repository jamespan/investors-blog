After posting 288% earnings growth during 2023, Wall Street analysts expect **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) to drive a 315% increase in profits to $4.06 per share for full-year 2024. Hailed as one of the [best stocks of last year](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-2024-palantir-applovin-alab-cava/), AppLovin stock stands poised to continue its highflying ways with a brand-new breakout.


And the latest report on [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-axon-applovin-tesla-meta-google/) shows savvy investors are betting heavily that AppLovin will keep rocketing higher.




Headquartered in the heart of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin has found its sweet spot at the nexus connecting of mobile apps and artificial intelligence. The specialty enterprise software firm provides end-to-end software and AI solutions. Its tools help businesses reach, monetize and grow their global audiences.


AppLovin helps clients connect to audiences via apps, mobile devices, streaming TV platforms and more.


AppLovin Stock Joins Billion-Dollar Club
----------------------------------------


The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/) member continues to garner strong demand from Wall Street. The latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds shows these institutional investors plunked down $1.11 billion for AppLovin shares during the month of January, according to data from Lipper.


AppLovin was just one of six stocks that were part of this billion-dollar club for that month. **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Robinhood Markets** ([HOOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOOD)), **Ameriprise Financial** ([AMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMP)) and **Blue Owl Capital** ([OWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OWL)) also secured membership.


Additional signs of demand for AppLovin include a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-ibd-rating-reveals-what-stocks-big-money-funds-are-buying/) and a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Plus, the stock sports seven quarters of rising fund ownership.


Sharing top billing among industry group peers such as **Descartes Systems** ([DSGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSGX)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), AppLovin stock earns the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-applovin-app.aspx).


Rocking After Reset, AppLovin Flies Toward Earnings
---------------------------------------------------


After bottoming out in January 2023, AppLovin launched its meteoric rise. Along the way, it [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/) in July by undercutting the low in its prior chart pattern. Such resets can give renewed life to a stock. That certainly was the case for AppLovin.


The stock quickly found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and soared to new heights. After notching a record high in December, the stock pulled back to form its current base, a second-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) with a 417.63 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Now the question is whether AppLovin can ride its strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-meta-nvidia-top-funds/) and break out into buy range. But with an eye on the principles of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), investors should note the AI leader is set to report earnings on Feb. 12. In addition to potential rewards, [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) brings potential risk, especially for an already highflying stock like AppLovin.


Fellow billion-dollar club member Robinhood, which ranks among IBD's [best online brokers for 2025](https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-scores-high-for-online-mobile-trading-apps/), also reports on Feb. 12. Meanwhile, Axon is taking aim at a new breakout with earnings due in March. The Taser maker just earned a spot on the [IBD Breakout Stocks Index](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/meta-stock-axon-crowdtrike-samsara-trump-tariffs/). This week, it was featured as a [top growth stock on the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/research/axon-stock-looks-to-continue-triple-digit-run-as-it-nears-a-buy-point/). With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-rs-rating-microsoft-stock/) on the rise, Axon closed the week just 3% shy of its 698.67 buy point.

Medical Stocks To Watch
-----------------------


Based in Pennsylvania, Globus Medical is a leading musculoskeletal solutions company focused on spinal products. Founded in 2003 with its IPO in 2012, the company claims to be the "fastest-growing company in the history of orthopedics."


Last month, [Globus Medical acquired Nemaris](http://www.investors.globusmedical.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globus-medical-acquires-surgimapr), the developer of Surgimap, a cloud-based preoperative planning platform. The company said the purchase "will further strengthen Globus Medical's ExcelsiusGPS platform by streamlining workflow and enabling superior data analytics."


Globus Medical has delivered three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a jump from 28% to 38% in Q2. Revenue gains have ranged from 11% to 16% over the last six quarters.


Analysts expect the company to post just a 6% gain in earnings per share when it reports Q3 numbers, expected in early November.


Rising institutional demand is one reason Globus Medical and its peers qualify as top medical stocks to watch. Each company saw a jump in fund ownership in Q2. Thirty-four mutual funds with an A+ rating own shares in Globus Medical.


Breakout Ahead?
---------------


Another reason Globus Medical is among the top medical stocks to watch is that it's closing in on a 57.65 buy point in a first-stage base. The stock showed strong volume while building the right side of that pattern last week.


It slipped 1.2% in above-average volume on Monday. In Tuesday morning trading, Globus Medical was down over 2% and testing support at its short-term 10-day moving average, putting it 5% below the entry. Volume was again trending higher than normal.



Abiomed is also pulling back Tuesday, but remains above the buy point in a later-stage double bottom. and Edwards Lifesciences had been extended from the 156.97 buy point it cleared on Sept. 24. But it gapped down sharply Tuesday after receiving a couple of [downgrades](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/edwards-stock-downgraded-heart-valve/). Align Technology continues to test its 385.10-to-404.36 buy zone.

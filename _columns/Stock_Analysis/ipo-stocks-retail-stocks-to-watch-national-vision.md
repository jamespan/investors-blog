With 133% earnings growth in Q2, **National Vision** ([EYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EYE)) is among the best [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) and top [retail stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news/) to watch during the current market correction. It's also forming a base that could launch a breakout move when a new stock market rally begins.




Along with [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Vici Properties** ([VICI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VICI)), **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) and **PetIQ** ([PETQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETQ)), National Vision made IBD's recent list of [eight IPO stocks with 133%-to-4,700% growth](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch/).


Despite the market downturn, Vici Properties continues to test a new buy zone, while National Vision, PagSeguro and PetIQ have, like most stocks, pulled back. But to catch the next crop of new leaders in the next uptrend, be sure to track fast-growing IPO stocks like these. They're often the ones that zoom higher when a new market rally kicks in.

IPO Stocks To Watch: Q3 Earnings Ahead
--------------------------------------


Following its 133% EPS gain in the second quarter, analysts are looking for a 50% increase in Q3. The Georgia-based eyeglasses and contact lens retailer has not yet set a date for its next report.


With a [95 Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), National Vision holds the No. 3 spot among specialty retail stocks. PetIQ and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) share the No. 1 ranking with the highest-possible 99 rating. The group itself ranks No. 22 among the 197 industries IBD tracks.


National Vision was founded in 1990 to operate Vision Centers for **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). It was acquired by private investment firm Berkshire Partners in 2005, then bought by **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) in 2014. It had its IPO in October 2017.


Due to recent selling, the stock has a lowly D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, but it has posted three quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 63 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-analyst-estimates-eps-growth/) with an A+ rating have a position in the stock.


PagSeguro has posted triple-digit EPS gains in each of the last eight quarters. But analysts expect that streak to end when theÂ Brazil-based payment processing company reports Q3 earnings on Nov. 29. Consensus analyst estimates call for a still-impressive 64% rise.


PetIQ has delivered average annual EPS growth of 2,866% over the last three quarters. But analysts expect a 7% decline in earnings when the pet health and wellness company reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 13.


Ulta Beauty's earnings growth has ranged from 23% to 41% over the last eight quarters. EPS gains are expected to come in at 21% in Ulta's next quarterly report.


Retail Stocks Near A Buy Point
------------------------------


National Vision remains below its 10-week moving average as it works on an early-stage chart pattern showing a 46.73 buy point. The stock sports a solid 92 Relative Strength Rating, and its RS line is within striking distance of a new 52-week high.


Look for the stock to convert the 10-week line from a [ceiling of resistance into a floor of support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/). And if the general market is able to launch a new rally, see if National Vision can kick-start a breakout of its own by clearing the entry price in volume at last 40% above average.


The stock showed resilience in the face of Monday's bearish reversal. National Vision managed to close in positive territory at 41.32. It remains 12% below the buy point.



PagSeguro and PetIQ have a lot of work to do before they're able to establish a new base and buy point. But Ulta Beauty may be closing in on a 290.40 entry in an early-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). It showed resistance to Monday's drop in the indexes to grab a 1.3% gain.


Vici Properties has been floating in and out of a 21.91-to-23.01 buy range. It fell below the buy point Monday as the market sold off and Vici dropped over 1%. The upward trend of the relative strength line for this February 2018 IPO points to resilience in a rough market. The Las Vegas-based real estate property trust (REIT) stock also pays a dividend, which currently yields 5.3% on an annualized basis.

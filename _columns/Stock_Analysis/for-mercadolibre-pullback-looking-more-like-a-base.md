As it continues to find support at its 10-week moving average, **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) also appears to be forming a new base.

  

The Latin American e-commerce company broke out of a double-bottom base in late March **1** and made a solid advance, reaching an all-time high.

  

As expected after such a heady gain, MercadoLibre pulled back to its 10-week moving average. **2**

  

After rising early Wednesday, the stock reversed lower to close near the bottom of its range for the day in volume 83% above average. That's weak action and something to keep an eye on, especially with the general market in a correction.

  

Still, MercadoLibre continues to hold above its 10-week line.

  

Volume was above average as the stock slipped to the 10-week line **3**, yet much of the week's volume came on a May 5 advance. Nonetheless, it would be encouraging to see the stock notch some up weeks in heavy volume.

  

Shares have been consolidating for five weeks, so it's reasonable to start thinking of the 12% pullback as a possible flat base. Tight price action in the consolidation is another plus.

Top-rated restaurant stocks like **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) may get a boost from last week's [7% surge in consumer confidence](http://news.investors.com/investing-ibd-industry-themes/092915-773256-restaurant-stocks-that-could-work.htm) and higher-than-expected consumer spending in August.

  

Two new bills that just cleared the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee could also benefit the restaurants industry group, which includes **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) .

  

The legislation would make permanent certain depreciation-related benefits for new restaurant construction.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Chipotle posted mixed results for Q2, just beating on earnings, but just missing on sales estimates. Q3 numbers are expected Oct. 20.

  

For the full year, analysts see EPS rising 23%, followed by a 19% gain in 2016.

  

Chipotle sports a 25% return on equity and annual EPS growth rate of 26%, earning it a 98 Composite Rating.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock's recent action is a case study in the concept of [support and resistance](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735785&sourceid=735786).

  

In the summer of 2014, Chipotle ran into resistance just under 700. It temporarily cleared that ceiling at the beginning of this year, but pulled back to form a 27-week consolidation.

  

The stock is now testing support at the 10-week line in tight trading as it works on an early-stage base with a 758.71 buy point.

  

The bottom of that pattern is right around Chipotle's prior area of resistance near 720. It's healthy when a stock turns a former ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support.

  

It's also bullish to see the relative strength line trending higher and near new high ground.

  

The question now is: Can Chipotle maintain that support and use it as a building block for a new climb?

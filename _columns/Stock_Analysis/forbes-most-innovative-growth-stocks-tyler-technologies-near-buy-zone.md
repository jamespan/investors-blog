Forbes' list of "Most Innovative Growth Companies 2016" ranks stocks like **Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)) by their innovation premium – defined as the difference between their market capitalization and the net present value of cash flow.


Plano, Texas-based Tyler ranked No. 24, joined by [**IBD 50**](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Aspen Technology** ([AZPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZPN)) (No. 14) and  **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) (No. 33).


Three companies that were buyout targets over the past three months also made the cut: **NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N)), bought by **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) in July; **Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)), acquired by **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) in August; and **Cepheid** ([CPHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPHD)), purchased by **Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)) just days ago.


Institutional Demand
--------------------


Tyler Technologies provides software to help local governments reduce costs while still meeting statutory obligations related to taxes and appraisals, courts and justice, and public safety.


Clients include over 14,000 local government offices in all 50 states, Canada, the United Kingdom and other international locations.


Attracted by a 25.3% pretax profit margin and solid three-year annual growth rates for earnings (29%) and sales (20%), mutual fund managers have taken an interest, with Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) and three other typically better-performing funds reporting a position.


Tyler's 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio, B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a rise in fund ownership last quarter confirm demand.


Reset Button
------------


Tyler Technologies broke out in October 2014, rising 88% before pulling back sharply at the beginning of this year.


The silver lining of that decline was how the stock **[reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/videos/getting-started-counting-bases/)**, potentially paving the way for a fresh run.



Tyler cleared a first-stage **[cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787)** entry in late June, but pulled back to form its current consolidation – a flat base as part of a first-stage **[base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/)**.


Tight trading along the 10-week moving average within the base points to support for the stock, which has held despite a sharp sell-off in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 last week.


On Monday, Tyler Technologies again found support at the 10-week line and at mid-day was trading 2% below a 171.51 buy point.


See if the general market uptrend holds and Tyler can clear the entry in volume at least 40% above average.

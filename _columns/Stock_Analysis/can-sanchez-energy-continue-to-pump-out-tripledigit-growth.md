Today we'll look at **Sanchez Energy** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), an exploration and production company that focuses on gas and oil within Texas's Eagle Ford Shale.

  

The company has a major producing position in that "liquids-rich" region and has further expanded its holdings there, by acquiring both the Cotulla and Wycross assets back in 2013.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Looking at earnings, Sanchez Energy has displayed strong triple digit growth in each of the last four reports, including a nice pop in the fourth quarter.

  

Revenue has also been very strong, with six consecutive quarters of high triple-digit gains.

  

The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings May 5.

  

As you like to see, the number of funds that own Sanchez Energy has been rising in recent quarters, and the Up/Down Volume Ratio is 1.1, indicating demand.

  

The stock's return on equity is 9% which is below the 17% minimum you would look for. But Sanchez earns an A for its SMR Rating, which tracks sales, profit margins, and return on equity as a whole.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is B+, indicating moderate buying over the last 13 weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On the MarketSmith weekly chart on this page, you can see that back in Oct. of last year, the stock started carving out a 16-week cup-shaped base.

  

Looking at the left side of the cup, you can see how the stock was correcting pretty heavily as it fell all the way to its 40-week line before finding support.

  

Sanchez Energy was able to mount a strong comeback, posting six back to back weeks of accumulation before breaking out of the pattern.

  

But the following week, the stock pulled back on volume that was well above average.

  

Since then, the stock has been working on a new base, trading around its 10-week line for much of that time.

  

Because the stock did not rise more than 20% from its previous base before forming this new pattern, these two consolidations count as one second-stage base-on-base formation.

  

The ideal buy point for the stock is 33.06, found by adding 10 cents to the peak on the left.

  

Since the market is still in correction mode, now is not the time to purchase new stocks. But with Sanchez Energy scheduled to release earnings on May 5, it could be one to keep an eye on.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-sanchez-energy-corp-sn.aspx) shows Sanchez carries a 98 Composite Rating.

  

And it's Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration and Production group ranks No. 22 among IBD's 197 industries.

**FEI Co.** ([FEIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEIC)) broke out of a double-bottom base in May and went on to hit a new high 1. But it's been showing weakness since then.

  

Last week, the stock tumbled 7% â€” the biggest one-week loss in 10 months.

  

Volume for the week came in at 4.2 million shares 2. That's the biggest amount of trading for a down week in more than three years, leaving little doubt that institutional players unloaded shares. Selling pressure has lightened so far this week as the selling subsides 3.

  

The stock climbed as much as 20% past the 34.66 buy point, but the recent sell-off has erased more than half of those gains.

  

This shows how important it is to buy at the proper buy point, and that it's often smart to lock in gains once you have a profit of about 20%.

  

FEI is nearing potential support at its 10-week moving average 4. It's important to see if the stock can hold above this key technical area.

  

With the market in a correction, this isn't the time to think about buying or adding shares to a position. That should only be done if the market stages a follow-through and confirms a new uptrend.

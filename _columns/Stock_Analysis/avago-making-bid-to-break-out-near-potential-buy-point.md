During market corrections, most stocks will follow the direction of the indexes. That's why you shouldn't buy stocks in a down market. But chip designer **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is bucking the trend.

  

On Thursday, it barely cleared a 36.28 buy point from a base-on-base pattern. It was still trying to break out decisively above that level Thursday after trimming earlier losses.

  

Avago broke out of a cup-with-handle base in May, but climbed less than 20% before settling into another base â€” thus, the base-on-base formation.

  

The stock's pattern had some pluses as well as some minuses. On the negative side, Avago had three down weeks in heavy trade 1, including the week of heaviest volume in the pattern.

  

On the positive side, the stock quickly regained its 10-week line this week 2. The bullish reversal the week of May 27 showed accumulation 3. Tight price action in the middle part of the new base also represented constructive action.

  

Avago's Relative Strength line is at a new high 4. That tells you it's outperforming the overall market.

The stars of the popular reality TV show "Storage Wars" hope to find hidden treasures in abandoned units. But **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)) has discovered a more practical path to profits: Running public storage facilities as a real estate investment trust (REIT).

  

Extra Space owns and/or operates 1,147 self-storage facilities in 35 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.

  

To qualify as a REIT, a company must receive at least 75% of its income from real estate and pay out 90% of that income to shareholders as dividends.

  

Extra Space Storage meets that criteria with its facilities comprising approximately 85.1 million square feet of rentable space.

  

The company pays a dividend currently yielding 3.1%.

  

Fellow members of the Finance-Property REIT industry group include **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)), **Sovran Self Storage** ([SSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSS)) and **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)).

  

In June, Extra Space announced it would buy SmartStop Self Storage, which at the time was the seventh largest operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Extra Space Storage has a long track record of delivering solid growth in sales and funds from operations, or FFO, the alternative to earnings per share used by REIT stocks.

  

For the full year, analysts expect FFO to rise 15%, followed by a 17% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Although the Property REIT industry group only ranks No. 96 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, Extra Space Storage's 97 Composite Rating is tops among its peers.

  

Mutual fund managers have taken note.

  

The stock sports a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

Plus, the number of funds with a position in Extra Space has been rising in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

While it's tough for any stock to move up while the general market trends down, Extra Space Storage has shown resilience.

  

It has so far found support along its 10-week line as it works on a first-stage [base-on-base formation](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/674610-base-on-base-structures-can-yield-big-breakouts.htm). Its Relative Strength line has been trending into new high ground.

  

During the week ended Sept. 18, the stock rose over 3% to reclaim its 10-week moving average. Volume was 121% above average.

  

The move came on the company's announcement of a $500 million private offer of exchangeable senior notes.

  

The buy point in the base is 79.25, 10 cents above the peak on the left.

  

While it's best to avoid making new buys in a correction, see if Extra Space Storage can continue to outperform the market and move higher when a new uptrend begins.

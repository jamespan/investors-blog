Investors may have big-buzz [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) like **Cava Group** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) and **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) on their radar. But what about **BBB Foods** ([TBBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBB)), the Mexican "hard discount" grocery retailer that just had its initial public offering in February and already earns a spot on this screen?




BBB Foods, or 3B, says the company name comes from the saying "Bueno, Bonito y Barato," which translates to "Good, Nice and Affordable."


Begun in 2005, 3B says it is the first "hard discount" supermarket in Mexico. The key to the hard-discount model is offering a limited selection of products that enables retailers to provide basic goods in high volume to streamline operations.


The IPO Leader operates more than 2,000 stores across 15 Mexican states. In addition to grocery staples, 3B carries products for personal care, household cleaning, pets and more.


As [Cava stock](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-screener-highlights-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/), [Duolingo](https://www.investors.com/research/duolingo-uber-ferrari-new-stocks-ibd-watchlists/), [Dutch Bros](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/dutch-bros-stock/) and other IPO stocks to watch show strength, here are four reasons to keep a close eye on 3B as well. Duolingo and Dutch Bros tease new buy zones while TBBB stock speaks that same language as it pops into buy range.


1. Mexican Retailer And IPO Delivers Growth
-------------------------------------------


From 2020 to 2022, 3B saw its revenue increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 34.4%. Its store count expanded significantly during the same period.


Sales growth has ranged from 24% to 72% over the last eight quarters.


Albeit based on prior-year quarters that showed a loss, the retailer has generated four straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. For 2024, analysts forecast a 105% gain in earnings to 40 cents per share.


2. IPO Leader Forming IPO Base
------------------------------


While fellow [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) Cava and Monday.com are extended, Dutch Bros and Duolingo join 3B in setting up new potential [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). BROS remains in buy range, while DUOL stock has slipped below the entry it briefly cleared on Thursday.


3B has formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-how-to-trade-new-issues-using-this-first-buy-point/) showing a 22.54 entry. The stock has so far closed higher for six of its seven weeks as a publicly traded company. On Thursday, the Mexican retailer punched past that buy point into buy range. Shares of TBBB stock rose nearly 3%, closing in buy range at 22.50.


Investors should note that such brand-new IPOs can be volatile. And BBB Foods is confirming that. During Friday's session, the stock has spiked, pulled back, and jumped again, now trading in buy range around 23.50.


So while IPO bases can deliver impressive gains, be sure to follow sound rules for [buying stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) and [selling stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/).


3. Relative Strength Line At New High
-------------------------------------


In a sign of market leadership, 3B has already hit a new high, earning it a [blue dot in MarketSurge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/), formerly known as MarketSmith.


Stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have their RS lines at or near a new 52-week high around the time of a breakout.


4. An IPO In Demand
-------------------


Having only been publicly traded since Feb. 9, 3B has yet to establish a track record of [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/before-buying-stocks-check-the-institutional-ownership/). But the stock's 1.8 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) indicates demand for shares of TBBB.


For this metric, any number above 1.0 points to demand. By comparison, Cava also sports a 1.8, while Monday.com earns a 1.5. The up/down volume ratio also shows demand for Dutch Bros (1.3) and Duolingo (1.1).

Nearly half of the $70 billion global pet food market is controlled by **Nestle** ([NSRGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSRGY)) and privately-held Mars, but **Blue Buffalo Pet Products** ([BUFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUFF)) is taking a bite out of the business with its focus on dog and cat food made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables.


While much smaller than Great-Dane-sized brands like Purina from Nestle and Pedigree from Mars, Blue Buffalo has grown revenue 26% a year over the last three years and estimates it now commands approximately 6% of the $26 billion U.S. pet food market.


But the 2015 IPO stock is still just a puppy with room to grow. According to its own estimates, it currently feeds only 2%-3% of the 164 million pets in America.


Blue Buffalo sells its BLUE Life Protection Formula for dogs and cats, among other products, through PetSmart and Petco (both of which went private within the last two years), as well as over 10,000 neighborhood stores across the country. It has also expanded across Canada and is moving into Mexico and Japan.


But the family-run business was sued by Nestle Purina PetCare for false advertising. While Blue Buffalo denied any wrongdoing, it acknowledged mislabeling products and settled the case for $32 million in December.


Signs Of Institutional Demand
-----------------------------


In Q4, Blue Buffalo posted a 33% jump in earnings and a 11% rise in revenue. The company sports a five-year annual EPS growth rate of 46%, and estimates for this year and next were recently revised higher.


The stock has a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a 2.0 Up/Down Volume Ratio, indicating demand for the stock. And its $4.8 billion market cap and average daily trading volume of 1.1 million shares make it an institutional quality stock.


Setting Up In IPO Base
----------------------

It got off to a slow start, slipping 47% while forming a deep IPO base.


But the stock has rebounded recently, boosted by a strong Q4 report that triggered a heavy-volume gap up on March 9. Blue Buffalo closed over 22% higher for the day on volume 893% above average.


The stock has continued to move higher since then, bringing it closer to a a potential 28.90 buy point.

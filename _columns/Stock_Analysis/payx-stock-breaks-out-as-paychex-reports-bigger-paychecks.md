Payroll and benefits leader **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)) handles payment for one in 12 American private-sector employees. Boosted by that market share, PAYX stock is attempting a fresh breakout as the stock market remains in a correction.




On Sept. 30, the [Market Pulse in The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) signaled that we had entered a market correction. While it's best to avoid making new buys when the trend is against you, Paychex has been bucking the downturn.


In a sign of market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for PAYX stock has hit a new, as indicated by a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/). Especially in a better market, it's a particularly bullish sign to see a stock's RS line hit a new 52-week high just ahead of or at the time of a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

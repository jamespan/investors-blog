As **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) CEO Mark Zuckerberg discovered amid the recent fake news and Cambridge Analytica scandals, the life of a young billionaire isn't always filled with glamour and Russian caviar. But investors appear to be liking the social media giant's stock again as it breaks out into a new buy zone.




Facebook's stock sold off sharply in early February and again in March as a media firestorm raged over allegations of [data harvesting by Cambridge Analytica](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/facebook-data-breach-cambridge-analytica-scandal-zuckerberg-social-media/) to influence the 2016 presidential election.


Since then, the stock has rebounded and is now just barely below the 195.32 all-time high it hit in February.


FANG Stocks Bite Back
---------------------


Along with fellow [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and to a lesser extent, Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), Facebook has shown [rising relative strength](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-rising-relative-strength/) over the last several weeks.



Amazon is trading at the top if its 1,568.62 to 1,647.05 buy zone, while Netflix has climbed just above its 338.92 to 355.87 buy range.


Alphabet has retaken its 50-day moving average, but still remains well below a buy point as it continues to base. The sultan of search rose over 2% Thursday in heavy volume and rose another 3% on Friday. Volume on both days was well above average.


Meanwhile, Facebook has rebounded nicely from the low it hit in late March.


In a sign of renewed technical strength, the 10-day moving average has moved back above the longer-term 50 day line. But the 50-day moving average remains below its 200-day cousin.


Facebook's relative strength line is right around a new 52-week high, a positive sign on a breakout. On Thursday, the stock gained over 2% to 191.78, putting it above the 188.42 buy point.


In Friday's afternoon session, Facebook is up over 1% and still within buy range, which extends to 197.84.


Note that volume was well below average on Thursday and again on Friday. You'd prefer to see a 40% or higher spike in trading on a breakout. See if heavier trading kicks in to show conviction for the move.

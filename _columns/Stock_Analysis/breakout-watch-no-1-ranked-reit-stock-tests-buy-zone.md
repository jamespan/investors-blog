When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, focus on fast-growing, highly profitable and well-run companies that are leaders within the technology trends driving the current bull market cycle. **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)) fits that bill.









 
 
 As a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on data centers, CoreSite is at the forefront of helping to meet the ever-increasing demand for cloud computing power driven by the rise of always-connected smart technology devices, homes and vehicles.
The Denver-based REIT currently operates 20 data centers across eight U.S. markets and enables clients to tap into the leading public cloud platforms, including **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Web Services, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Azure and Google Cloud Platform from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


Over 1,200 of the world's leading enterprises, network operators and cloud providers use CoreSite, including **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Cars.com** ([CARS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARS)).


Earlier this month, [CoreSite announced it was teaming up with Tata Communications](http://www.coresite.com/about/news-events/press-releases/tata-coresite-join-deliver-digital-transformation) to help Tata expand its cloud and managed hosting services in the U.S.


46% Growth, 3.1% Dividend
-------------------------


CoreSite has generated a strong 46% three-year growth rate for funds from operations (FFO), the equivalent of earnings for REIT stocks. Revenue has been rising at a 20% annual clip.


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member also sports a 21% annual pretax profit margin and pays a dividend currently yielding 3.1% on an annualized basis.


CoreSite has a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and has seen two quarters of rising fund ownership, with 67 funds earning an A or A+ rating reporting a position in the stock. But the stock's 0.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio is well below the 1 or higher score you look for, so see if that improves as the stock tries to keep climbing.


CoreSite's 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) earns it the No. 1 rank within the Finance-Property REIT industry group.


Second-Stage Cup With Handle
----------------------------


Patience has paid off for early investors in CoreSite. From a 16.01 close on the day of its IPO in September 2010 through Monday's closing price of 115.47, the stock has risen over 620% in a relatively steady and controlled fashion.



After testing a 111.86 buy point in a second-stage cup with handle, CoreSite closed above it Tuesday in volume that was rising and 20% above average, below the 40% or higher spike you prefer to see on a breakout.


As the Nasdaq and S&P 500 ran into headwinds recently, CoreSite continued to show strength and resilience as its RS line moved into new high ground.


On Wednesday, the stock rose just under 1% in volume 13% above average, slightly below Tuesday's trading. CoreSite remains in the buy zone, which extends to 117.45.

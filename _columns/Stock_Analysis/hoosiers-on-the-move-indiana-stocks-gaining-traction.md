**Patrick Industries** ([PATK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATK)) recently made the list of finalists for the [**2016 Indiana Public Company of the Year**](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/indiana-public-company-finalists-named-131500445.html), which also includes other Hoosier stocks showing notable chart action, including **Angie's List** ([ANGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANGI)), **Berry Plastics** ([BERY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BERY)), **Drew Industries** ([DW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DW)), **Kimball International** ([KBAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBAL)) and [**IBD 50**](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)).


While Drew Industries and Thor Industries have already driven well recent buy points, Patrick Industries — a fellow member of the No. 4-ranked recreational vehicles (RV) and manufactured home group — is trying put the finishing touches on a second-stage [**flat base**](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=3).


Joins S&P 600
-------------


Founded in 1959, Patrick Industries is a leading manufacturer of building products and materials for RVs and manufactured homes.


Boosted by a 99 Composite Rating, 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio and average earnings growth of 49% over the last three quarters, Patrick Industries earns the No. 2 rank among its industry peers, just behind Drew Industries and just ahead of Thor.


The stock was added to the small-cap S&P 600 index last month, replacing **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), which moved to the midcap S&P 400.


Building New Buy Point
----------------------


After **[resetting its base count](https://www.investors.com/videos/getting-started-counting-bases/)** in February, Patrick Industries cleared a first-stage consolidation and found support at the 10-week line as it rose sharply higher.


The stock pulled back last month to begin forming its current flat base, finding good support at the 10-week line in the bottom of the pattern.


Volume spiked during the week ended Aug. 19, as it rose over 6% after being added to the S&P 600.


Look for Patrick Industries to clear the 69.63 buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

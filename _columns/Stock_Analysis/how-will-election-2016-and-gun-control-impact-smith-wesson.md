The rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has surprised many political pundits, but two things seem certain this election cycle:  gun control will remain a controversial topic and that will continue to impact leading firearms manufacturer **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)).


Gun sales hit an all-time high in 2015 as the battle between Second Amendment rights activists and advocates for tighter gun laws heated up, and President Obama called for more restrictions on the sale of firearms.


That’s pumped up Smith & Wesson’s stock over 50% since last April, while rival **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) is up just 15% over the same period.


Smith & Wesson Vs. Sturm Ruger
------------------------------


Smith & Wesson earns the No. 1 spot within the Security-Safety industry group, outpacing Sturm Ruger in both annual pre-tax profit margins (15.4% vs. 10.5%) and annual EPS growth rate (54% vs. 9%).


Smith & Wesson also outperformed its rival last quarter, with a 32% increase in revenue and 178% EPS growth. Sturm Ruger’s top- and bottom-line growth came in lower, but at a still robust 23% and 82%, respectively.


Smith & Wesson is scheduled to report fiscal 2016 Q3 earnings on Mar. 3, while Sturm Ruger reports its latest numbers Feb. 24.


For fiscal 2016, which ends in April, analysts expect Smith & Wesson's earnings to rise 40%, then slow to a 10% gain in fiscal 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Shooting For Pentagon Sidearm Contract
--------------------------------------


Smith & Wesson is also reported to be vying with Glock, Beretta and SIG Sauer for the Pentagon’s [Modular Handgun System contract](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/smith-and-wesson-growing-buyouts-new-products/). The winner will provide a new sidearm for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines to replace the Beretta M9. Bids were due Feb. 12. Sturm Ruger chose not to enter the competition.


Taking Aim At New Buy Point
---------------------------


After resetting its base count in Oct. 2014, Smith & Wesson broke out of a first-stage cup-with-handle last April. Note how the 10-week line crossed back over the 40-week line while forming the right side of the base -- a positive sign of renewed strength.


Since then, the stock[![Markup_SWHC](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Markup_SWHC-300x264.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Markup_SWHC.jpg) has consistently found support at the 10-week moving average, which has stayed nicely above the 40-week line.


Along the way, the stock posted multiple heavy-volume up weeks, a clear sign of institutional buying.


Smith & Wesson is now working on a second-stage pattern, and its Relative Strength line remains near new high ground.


The current buy point is 26.64, but the stock is working on Day No. 3 of a potential handle, which takes at least five days to form. If Smith & Wesson completes that formation, the buy point will be 24.62, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

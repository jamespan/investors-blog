While there are no guarantees in the market, one of the keys to successful investing is to focus on stocks that the top mutual fund managers are buying. Mobile and wireless technology leader **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)) fits that bill.
The Delaware-based company made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/grubhub-delivers-food-profit-for-top-funds/), with 18 funds investing approximately $12 million from November to January.


InterDigital also sports an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.9 Up/Down Volume Ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership.

Triple-Digit Growth
-------------------


Fund managers are attracted to explosive growth, and InterDigital delivered a 340% rise in earnings and a 107% spike in sales in Q3. Consensus estimates for Q4 call for a 317% EPS gain in Q4 and a 157% rise for all of last year.


The company already sports a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 58%, and is set to report fourth quarter and full year 2016 results before the open on Feb. 23.


While InterDigital's track record is strong and expectations for the next report are high, what happens if the numbers disappoint? That's why it's risky to buy any stock just before it announces results.


5G And IoT
----------


InterDigital says it's "creating the living network" through technology that enables faster and more efficient wireless networks and new mobile broadband capabilities.


Already a leader in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that expand industrial automation and health care innovations, such as remote patient monitoring, the company is aggressively gearing up for the coming 5G revolution and next-generation networks.


InterDigital says its [EdgeHaul millimeter wave mesh backhaul technology](http://www.interdigital.com/solution/edgehaul) is an immediate solution for wireless gigabit connectivity and a platform for future 5G wireless transport.


In December, the company bought sensor processing pioneer Hillcrest Labs, whose technology is found in smart TVs, gaming systems, smartphones, virtual reality systems and other devices.


Mobilizing A Breakout?
----------------------


InterDigital broke out of a base last August, rising as much as 63% before peaking in December. Since then, the stock has been working on a second-stage flat base with a 98.10 buy point.



InterDigital has shown good support along its 50-day and shorter-term 10-day moving averages, while its Relative Strength line has been floating near new high ground.


On Thursday, the stock slipped slightly, then bounced back to a 1% gain in below-average, but rising trade, once again finding support at its 10-day line.


See if InterDigital can meet or beat the high expectations for its next report and break out in heavy volume.

As cable and telephone companies increasingly pipe programming to TVs over the internet rather than by more traditional means, companies like **Arris Group** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)) are poised to benefit.

  

It's called Internet Protocol Television — or IPTV for short — and as a Dec. 5 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/120413-681712-arris-group-thrives-as-cable-television-moves-to-iptv.htm) noted, it lets cable and other providers deliver video and other data like they do for Web and tablet viewing. With IPTV, they can offer viewers rich options through most modern set-boxes.

  

Arris used to focus on delivering data. But last year the firm bought the Motorola Home business from **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)), which added video the mix. It's also released several new products as well as software upgrades and enhancements to its set top boxes, routers, modems and other equipment.

  

Its Customer Premises Equipment division accounts about 70% of its sales. That segment includes various digital video set-top boxes and gateways, data and voice modems.

  

The other 30% of its sales comes from its network and cloud services segment, which includes video infrastructure as well as multiscreen and on-demand advertising.

  

Arris' largest customers are TV service providers **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)), **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Time Warner Cable** ([TWC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWC)).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Arris' sales growth has been accelerating, hitting 199% last quarter. 

  

• Earnings growth stood at 77% last quarter. 

  

• Going forward, analysts see earnings rising 67% this year and 31% next year. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-arris-group-inc-arrs.aspx) how Arris' Composite Rating is the best among the 29 stocks in the Telecom-Cable/Satellite Equipment industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 34 among IBD's 197 groups, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Turning to the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, Arris broke out of a cup-with-handle base in late October and launched a new run.

  

It's now climbed about 23% past the ideal buy point in that pattern. Knowing when to sell can be one of the trickiest parts of investing. And some people use the strategy of selling once a stock's climbed 20% to 25% above the point they bought it at. That way you take some cash off the table and lock your gains.

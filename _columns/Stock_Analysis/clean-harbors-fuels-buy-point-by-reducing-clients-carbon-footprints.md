Climate change, global warming, green energy and/or sustainability drive big news and big business, by whatever name you choose. And environmental services leader **Clean Harbors** ([CLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLH)) taps into that trend, reducing the carbon footprint across North America.




Boosted by a fourth-straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth, CLH stock now aims to generate a clean break past its current [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Clean Harbors Cuts Carbon Footprint While Fueling Big Growth
------------------------------------------------------------


Based in Massachusetts, Clean Harbors is North America's leading provider of environmental and industrial services. It counts a majority of Fortune 500 companies as clients, with operations throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.


Services include end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency spill response, industrial cleaning and maintenance, and recycling services.


Earlier this year, the company's Safety-Kleen division [introduced KLEEN+](https://www.cleanharbors.com/2022/safety-kleen-introduces-kleen-brand-of-base-oils), a new family of base oil grades aimed at lowering the environmental impact of automotive and industrial lubricants by reducing their carbon footprint.


Base oil is one of the most processed elements in a barrel of petroleum. For that reason, it carries a large carbon footprint.


A recent independent study found that Safety-Kleen's base oil achieved as much as a 78% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a per gallon basis, compared to traditional refining.


Clean Harbors posted 113% EPS growth in the third quarter. Analysts forecast 48% EPS growth in Q4 and a 95% increase for the full year.


Q3 sales grew 43% year-over-year to $1.37 billion and have averaged 17% over the last three years.


CLH Stock Charges Toward Green Energy-Breakout
----------------------------------------------


Since November of last year, Clean Harbors has encountered long-term resistance between the 118 to 120 mark multiple times. But CLH stock now trades above that range, looking to clear a 124.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/)


Boosted by a streak of seven straight up days, Clean Harbors has moved solidly above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/). It closed the shortened Thanksgiving trading week just shy of the entry.


Industry peers CECO and HDSN are showing strength as well as Clean Harbors looks to sustain its upward trajectory.

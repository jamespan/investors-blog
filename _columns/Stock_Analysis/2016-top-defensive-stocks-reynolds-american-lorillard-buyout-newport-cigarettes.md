In a down market, mutual fund managers tend to shift their money into defensive stocks. And that could potentially spark a new breakout for tobacco titan **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)).

  

The maker of Camel and Pall Mall brand cigarettes also picked up Newport, America's top menthol cigarette, when Reynolds completed its $25 billion buyout of Lorillard last year.

  

The Winston-Salem, NC-based firm also recently announced the creation of RAI Innovations, a new division that will focus on vapor and nicotine products.

  

Reynolds American sports the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, earning in the No. 1 ranking within its industry group, ahead of **Altria** ([MO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MO)) and **Philip Morris International** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)). The tobacco group ranks No. 24 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Boosted by its purchase of Newport and a rise in prices for tobacco products, Reynolds saw revenue growth rise 41% in Q3. Its total domestic retail cigarette market share increased 0.3% to 33.9%. Earnings-per-share rose 17%.

  

The company is scheduled to report Q4 numbers on Feb. 8. Analyst expect 2015 earnings to rise 16%, followed by a 17% gain this year. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Reynolds pays a dividend currently yielding 3% and sports a strong 38% return on equity.

  

The number of funds with a position in the stock has been rising in recent quarters, but the Up/Down Volume Ratio is just 0.8. Look for that to get over 1.0 to show increasing demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Since resetting its base count in February 2014 then breaking out the following month, Reynolds has risen over 75%, forming multiple bases along the way.

  

Because each new pattern began forming before the stock rose at least 20% from the prior buy point, its current consolidation is technically considered part of a long, first-stage [base-on-base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/771399-base-on-base-breakout-yield-big-gains.htm) formation.

  

But investors should not ignore the fact that Reynolds has already made a significant move, so it wouldn't be unusual for the stock to pull back into a deeper correction.

  

At least so far, however, the stock has continued to show strength despite this year's sharp sell-off in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, earning it a spot on [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/products/default.aspx?id=trial2013&src=ABLBCDR). That resilience is reflected in the sharply rising Relative Strength line, which is already in new high ground ahead of a possible breakout from a 49.66 entry.

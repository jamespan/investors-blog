With the market in a correction, now is the time to look for stocks that could take off when a new uptrend begins. Here are 3 reasons why **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) has the potential to be one of those future big winners.

  

**1. Newer IPO stock.**

  

Mobileye went public last August, and history shows that the top-performing stocks make their biggest moves within the first few years of their initial public offering.

  

**2. Leader in major new trend.**

  

The Israel-based firm is a clear leader in a fast-growing trend that's part of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution: smart car technology.

  

Its driver assistance systems (ADAS) and vision technology are already used by 22 of the world's top 25 automakers, including **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Nissan** ([NSANY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSANY)) and BMW.

  

Mobileye has also partnered with **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) in the [self-driving car arena](http://news.investors.com/technology/081715-766859-tesla-motors-mobileye-stock-up-on-self-driving-cars-uber.htm).

  

**3. Strong fundamentals and rising institutional demand.**

  

Mobileye has a track record of solid earnings and sales growth, and top-performing mutual funds, including Fidelity Contrafund, have taken a position in the stock.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth more than tripled last quarter, from 33% to 100%. And sales growth more than doubled from 28% to 57%.

  

Analysts expect EPS to rise 105% this year, followed by a 67% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Mobileye sports a solid 17% return on equity, helping it earn a 97 Composite Rating.

  

As the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sold off recently, Mobileye also hit some selling headwinds, lowering its Accumulation/Distribution Rating to a C-.

  

But the sharp rise in fund ownership over the last two quarters shows underlying institutional demand for the stock.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After going public just over one year ago, Mobileye quickly formed an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/ipo-trading-strategies/?src=APA1BQ8). It broke out and soon rose as much as 41%.

  

It then began forming a deep cup-with-handle. Mobileye was featured in the June 11 [IBD Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/061115-756816-smart-car-stock-mobileye-breaks-out-camera-may-be-in-tesla-self-driving-model-s.aspx) just as it was starting to climb past the 48.88 entry.

  

Within six weeks, the stock entered the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=739143&sourceid=735788), which was a good opportunity to lock in some gains, especially given the choppy, roller coaster behavior of the market at that time.

  

When the indexes retreat in heavy volume, it's hard for any stock to buck that trend, and Mobileye is no exception.

  

It pulled back sharply last Friday as the general market plunged, and fell even further during the trading session on Monday.

  

But the stock has since bounced back and is trying to reclaim its 10-week moving average.

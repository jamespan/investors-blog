With bellwether stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) rebounding from recent pullbacks and the major indexes retaking key lines of support, the prospects for breakout stocks like **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) are looking up.









 
 
 Apple and Netflix were both trading near all-time highs last week, and Cisco hit a new 52-week intraday high with a sharply rising relative strength line.
HealthEquity, which has the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating and holds the No. 1 ranking within the outsourcing services industry group, has jumped into a new buy zone in heavy volume.


While it's certainly positive to see leading stocks, as well as the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, showing renewed strength, investors should continue to keep a close eye on their stocks in case the nascent uptrend fails to last.


Accelerating Earnings And Sales Growth
--------------------------------------


Based in Utah and founded in 2002, HealthEquity is the nation's largest, nonbank health savings account (HSA) administrator.


In 2017, the company made IBD's list of the [best HSA providers](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/best-hsa-providers-by-fees-features-and-investment-options/) by fees, features and investment options. Look for this year's report on the best HSAs in the coming weeks.


HealthEquity has posted three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a jump from 37% to 70% in its latest report.


Revenue gains for the [IBD 50 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) have ranged from 26% to 47% over the last eight quarters.


Trading At Top Of Buy Range
---------------------------


HealthEquity was featured in the [Aug. 26, 2016, IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/health-equity-nears-buy-point-as-big-banks-sell-hsa-assets/), just before it broke out the next week from a flat base with a 31.79 entry.


Fast forward to today, and the stock is now at the upper end of a 52.53 to 55.16 buy zone it initially entered on Feb. 12.



The chart pattern was somewhat choppy and awkward, but volume on the Feb. 12 breakout was 72% above average, followed by two more up days in higher-than-normal trade.


The relative strength line has been trending higher, but remains below new high ground.


On Friday, HealthEquity and Cisco closed fractionally higher. Apple and Netflix were down for the day, but both were up sharply for the week, with gains of 10% and 11% respectively.


In early trading Tuesday, HealthEquity and Netflix were up around 0.5%, and Apple was also in positive territory. Cisco was down and trying to hold above 44.

With three straight quarters of accelerating sales and earnings growth and the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, dental products maker **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) may put a smile on investors' faces as it tests a new buy zone.


 The maker of Invisalign invisible braces has posted average EPS growth of 38% over the last three quarters, as earnings gains jumped from 18% in Q1 to 60% in Q3. Revenue growth has risen from 30% to 38% during the same period.


Align made the latest list of [stocks expected to show 50%-plus earnings growth in Q4](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/q4-earnings-preview-which-stocks-expect-50-or-greater-growth/), with analysts looking for a 62% increase in earnings when the [IBD 50 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) reports Q4 numbers on Jan. 30.


No. 1 Ranked Medical Stock
--------------------------


Align Technology holds the No. 1 ranking among its peers in the medical products industry group, ahead of **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), **Teleflex** ([TFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFX)) and **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)).


Institutional demand for Align is indicated by an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and eight consecutive quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 97 mutual funds with an A+ rating have a position in Align, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)).


Abiomed, which makes medical devices to assist or replace the heart's pumping functionality, is up 14% from a breakout on Jan. 4, while disposable medical device manufacturer Teleflex is still in buy range from a breakout on Wednesday.


Portable oxygen concentrator maker Inogen is working on a second-stage, but is still below its 50-day moving average. On Friday, Inogen closed in on retaking that benchmark with a gain of nearly 3%.


Biting Into New Buy Zone
------------------------


Align gapped up to a 16% gain on Oct. 27 after posting a spike in earnings growth from 37% to 60% for the third quarter. It then pulled back to form a later-stage base, showing good signs of accumulation in the right side of the pattern.


On Wednesday, it cleared the 266.51 entry, but volume was just 6% above average, well below the 40% or greater spike you prefer to see on a breakout.


On Friday morning, Align pulled back below the buy point, but managed to recoup most of that decline by the close and end the day back in the buy zone at 269.46.



The relative strength line has moved higher, but remains below new-high ground. Look for the RS line to keep climbing and for stronger volume to kick in to show conviction for the breakout. Also continue to [keep a close eye on current market trends](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) to see if the indexes and leading stocks begin to correct.

With cyberattacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, demand for cybersecurity solutions from firms like **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)), **Check Point Software Technologies** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)), **Barracuda Networks** ([CUDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUDA)) and **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)) is on the rise.


But will demand for cybersecurity stocks match the demand for cybersecurity products, especially in what's been an unforgiving earnings season and volatile market?


Triple-Digit Earnings Growth
----------------------------


Proofpoint beat estimates when it reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 20, sending the stock nearly 11% higher the next day in volume 404% above average. But the stock has since pulled back as the general market has come under pressure.


Earnings growth came in at 733%, the second straight quarter of triple-digit gains. But note that both reports were based on comparisons to year-over-year quarters that showed no earnings.


Revenue growth has been strong and steady for Proofpoint, with sales gains ranging from 35% to 44% over the last eight reports.


The Silicon Valley-based company, which had its IPO in 2012, provides cloud-based security solutions that help businesses protect information their employees share via email, social media and mobile apps.


Institutional demand for Proofpoint is reflected in its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 Up/Down Volume Ratio and two straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, two typically better-performing mutual funds own shares of Proofpoint, including T Rowe Price New Horizons ([PRNHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRNHX)).


Beware The Breach
-----------------


Proofpoint ranks No. 2 within the security software industry group, just behind **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), which is set to report Q3 earnings after the market close.


Both stocks closed below their 50-day moving averages on Wednesday. Proofpoint and Qualys were up slightly around mid-day Thursday, but were still below the line.



Other industry peers, including **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **KEYW Holding** ([KEYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYW)) and Barracuda Networks, have also fallen below that benchmark line.


Like Proofpoint, Check Point topped estimates when it reported Q3 earnings on Oct. 31, pushing shares up over 4% in heavy volume for the day. But the stock is still in recovery mode, with its 10-week line below the 40-week moving average.


Symantec and **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) are showing more technical strength, but the overall behavior of the top cybersecurity stocks and the general market show it's a time to proceed with caution.


Symantec, **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)), **Imperva** ([IMPV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMPV)) and **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) are all on tap to report earnings after the close Thursday.


If the market regains its strength, look for the group leaders to rebound and see if Proofpoint can clear an 80.78 entry in the first-stage base it's been forming since early September.

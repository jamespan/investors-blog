Chinese Stocks To Watch: Two Breakouts Ahead?
---------------------------------------------


As [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/amazon-stock-targets-buy-apple-facebook-follow-suit/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) have been showing, like birds of a feather, stocks often flock together. Such has been the case for New Oriental Education and TAL Education.


Both of these leading Chinese stocks have been forming new bases and are now testing possible buy points. Plus, each stock is showing a promising setup, with the new patterns showing shallower declines than in their earlier formations.


Investors can view New Oriental Education's current chart pattern in two ways: as a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) and as a cup without handle. The buy point for the former was 92.95. For the cup without handle, the entry is 98.09. While the handle offered an earlier [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), both entries are valid.


In early trading Monday, New Oriental Education gapped up to clear a 98.09 entry. Volume is trending well above average.


TAL Education also gapped up and is now trying to clear entries at 39.37 and 39.60.

It's a positive sign of technical strength and [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) to see a group of highly rated growth stocks stocks setting up.

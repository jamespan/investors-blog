With fourth-quarter earnings due after the close Wednesday, will **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) show its big bets are paying off or will the social media giant give investors a virtual reality check?


CEO Mark Zuckerberg has put well over $20 billion on the line in recent years to buy Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR, which is set to start shipping its virtual reality headsets on March 28.


Facebook has also been investing heavily in mobile ad technology as it battles with **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and its Google-run YouTube division for mobile video advertising market share. According to Rosenblatt Security analyst Martin Pyykkonen, Facebook’s strategic spending could [accelerate its competitive advantage](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/will-facebook-spending-splurge-show-payoff-with-q4-earnings/) in the same way Google sped past **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) in paid search advertising over a decade ago.


Billions Of Monthly Active Users
--------------------------------


Facebook has been generating strong sales growth in recent quarters, powered by a growing customer base that now includes over 1.55 billion monthly active Facebook users,  over 900 million WhatsApp users and more than 800 million users of its Messenger app.


Revenue gains have ranged from 39% to 49% over the last four quarters, and earnings growth jumped from 16% to 33% in Q3.


Analysts ex[![Markup_FB](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Markup_FB.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Markup_FB.jpg)pect full-year 2015 earnings-per-share to rise 23%, then speed up to 33% in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


While Facebook earns the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, it also earns the lowest-possible Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E. The reaction to Wednesday’s earnings report will help clarify if recent selling is simply a reaction to general market weakness or a sign that fund managers are losing conviction in the stock.


Testing Support Ahead Of Earnings
---------------------------------


Earnings season is always a crapshoot, but checking the chart can provide clues to how a stock is holding up ahead of its quarterly report.


Facebook lost a key area of support at the beginning of this year, when it fell below its 10-week line. But it found support at its second line of defense -- the 40-week moving average.


On Monday, the stock also found support at its prior 96.59 buy point, and its Relative Strength line continues to hover near new high ground.


But Facebook still needs to get back above its 10-week moving average. And as it continues to work on a new base, look for volume on up weeks to rise and preferably exceed trading on recent down weeks. Wednesday’s earnings report may be the catalyst Facebook needs to make that happen.


Also watch for upcoming reports from other bellwether stocks, including **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) (Jan. 26), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) (Jan. 28) and Alphabet (Feb. 1). Investor reactions to the latest earnings from these big name stocks will provide important insight into current sentiment among fund managers.

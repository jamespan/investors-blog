What's driving merger mania in the semiconductor industry? According to [IC Insights](http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1328395&_mc=NL_EET_EDT_EET_daily_20151202&cid=NL_EET_EDT_EET_daily_20151202&elq=9557fa5937574313a6c02cdc2d92bbb5&elqCampaignId=25979&elqaid=29625&elqat=1&elqTrackId=5ad113704b5c4b58a1ab12cdbebb7084), it's a result of "the pressure these companies are facing in trying to grow their sales faster than the market is growing."


The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution is another factor, driving chipmakers to expand their product offerings to take advantage of new market opportunities.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone chip supplier **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is at the forefront of recent M&A activity, and is looking to close its $37 billion buyout of **Broadcom** ([BRCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCM)) by Feb. 1.


Other mega-mergers of 2015 include the $16.7 billion acquisition of **Altera** ([ALTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALTR)) by **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and the $11.8 billion purchase of **Freescale Semiconductor** ([FSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSL)) by **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)).


Last month, **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) pulled the plug on its proposed takeover of **PMC-Sierra** ([PMCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PMCS)), clearing the way for **Microsemi** ([MSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCC)) to make the winning bid.


**Key Numbers**


On Dec. 2, Avago announced earnings and revenue growth that continued to slow but beat estimates for its fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 1.


For fiscal 2016 and 2017, analysts expect EPS to rise 8%. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


Avago pays a dividend currently yielding 1.1% and has a five-year annual EPS growth rate of 27%. Its 5-year growth rate of 56% is even more impressive.


That helps the Singapore-based chip designer earn the best-possible 99 Composite Rating, and attract the interest of institutional investors.


The number of funds with a position in Avago has been on the rise in recent quarters, and four typically better-performing funds own shares, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and MFS Growth (MFEGX).


**Chart Analysis**


Even before the Aug. 24 flash crash, Avago was in the process of resetting its base count by hitting a new low that undercut the low in the prior base.


As it continues to work on a 27-week, first-stage consolidation, the Relative Strength line has moved into new high ground, a bullish sign ahead of a potential breakout.


On Dec. 3, the day after reporting earnings, Avago gapped up to close nearly 10% higher for the day. Volume spiked to 223% above average, and came in 60% above average the next day.


The ideal buy point is 150.60, 10 cents above the peak on the left. That makes the buying range from 150.60 to 158.13.


On Monday, Avago Technologies closed just below that buy zone.

Homebuilder stocks like **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)),  **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) are showing signs of a rebound after [new-home sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/new-home-sales-in-u-s-surge-to-highest-level-in-eight-years/) rose to their highest level in eight years in April. But here's another top-rated stock that could get a boost from a stronger housing market: **Fortune Brands Home & Security** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)).


Through its portfolio of companies, Fortune Brands offers cabinetry, plumbing, door and security products. Roughly half of revenue comes from the repair and remodel market, with another 20% to 25% tied to new-home construction.


The company’s Moen brand of kitchen and bathroom faucets and accessories has exclusive contracts with the majority of America’s largest homebuilders. Moen products are also carried by major retailers **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)).


First-quarter earnings and sales both beat analyst estimates, as revenue grew 16% to $1.11 billion, and EPS growth hit 39% and accelerated for the fourth straight quarter. Fortune Brands also raised its full-year earnings outlook. 


Fortune Brands sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, and its 99 Composite Rating earns it a spot among the top five stocks in the construction products industry group, along with [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)).


**Laying Foundation For New Climb?**

Since Fortune Brands rose less than 20% from the prior entry, the new pattern is part of a base-on-base formation. 


The stock has found support at the 10-week moving average, a sign it may be forming stepping stones for a new run.


The Relative Strength line is just below new-high ground, as Fortune Brands tries to close in on a 60.08 entry.

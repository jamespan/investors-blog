Fueled by its high-octane Monster Energy drinks and a new deal with Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage jumped sharply in mid-August.

  

**Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) agreed to pay **Monster** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) $2.15 billion in cash for a 17% stake in the company. Coke will also transfer its energy-drink division to Monster, while Monster agreed to transfer its nonenergy drinks to Coke and put two Coca-Cola appointees on its board.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of more-modest growth, earnings rose 49% in the first quarter and 31% in Q2. Sales growth has ranged from 9% to 15% over the past four reports.

  

Monster is expected to release Q3 numbers in early November. For the full year, analysts see EPS rising 32%, followed by a 19% gain in 2015.

  

The Corona, Calif.-based company has a strong 41.4% return on equity and a 95 IBD Composite Rating.

  

While its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a mediocre C+ in Friday's IBD, the companty does sport a solid 1.7 up-down volume ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a big multiyear move, the stock went into a slump starting in June 2012.

  

But in August of this year, it got re-energized on news of the deal with Coke, soaring more than 30% in one day.

  

Since then, the stock has managed to hold on to the bulk of those gains while forming a base, and its Relative Strength line has continued to edge higher. That's positive action, especially in light of recent market weakness.

  

The buy point is 95.03, or 10 cents above the prior peak. Another logical entry is at 92.87, at a resistance area in the pattern.

  

While it's best to avoid new buys during a market correction, Monster could be one to watch when the market rebounds.

Discount retailer **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) doesn't often come up in the same conversation with social media giant **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). But the two highly rated stocks have one thing in common: Both are struggling to break out from a base.


As noted in the [July 19 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/facebook-setting-up-ahead-of-q2-earnings-but-with-blemishes/), Facebook had a few blemishes as it approached a 121.18 entry ahead of its July 27 Q2 earnings report. Its 0.9 up/down volume ratio and D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating at the time didn't indicate the level of demand you prefer to see on a breakout. While Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has since improved to a C+, volume was flat on Wednesday as it cleared the buy point. The tech titan fell back below the entry on Thursday.


Ollie's Bargain Outlet showed similar action last Tuesday as it tried to clear a 26.65 buy point from a [double-bottom](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2) base. Volume was just 14% above average, below the minimum 40% spike you look for on the day of a breakout.


While both stocks are now trading below their buy points, Ollie's Bargain Outlet and Facebook each sport a solid 97 Composite Rating and certainly remain watch list-worthy. Ollie hovered just below 26 in afternoon trades Friday while Facebook neared 121.


Discounts Drive Profits
-----------------------


Founded in 1982, Ollie's Bargain Outlet had its initial public offering in July 2015. The Pennsylvania-based retailer operates 215 self-described "semi-lovely" stores offering "good stuff cheap" in 19 states.


Ollie's has posted two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including an 82% rise for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (ended April 30). It holds the No. 2 rank within the discount retailers industry group, behind **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and ahead of **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)).


The number of funds that hold Ollie's shares has been rising in recent quarters, and three typically better-performing mutual funds have reported owning shares, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)).

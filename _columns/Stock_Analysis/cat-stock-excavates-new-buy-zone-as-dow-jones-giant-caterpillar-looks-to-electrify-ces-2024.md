While **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and other [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) obsess over artificial intelligence, heavy equipment behemoth **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) is amped up to electrify job sites â€” showcasing two innovative machines at CES 2024. Meanwhile, Dow Jones giant CAT stock digs into a new [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).




No stranger to the world of high tech, Caterpillar showcased [autonomy and augmented reality](https://www.caterpillar.com/en/news/corporate-press-releases/h/ces-2023.html), as well as sustainability, at the most recent CES, one of the world's the largest technology shows, held annually in Las Vegas.


Next month, [Caterpillar plans to electrify CES 2024](https://www.cat.com/en_AU/news/machine-press-releases/caterpillar-to-amplify-electrification-and-energy-solutions-at-ces-2024.html) with a focus on two innovative machines.


What Is Caterpillar Doing At CES 2024?
--------------------------------------


At CES, the Dow Jones member will focus on its electric machines and energy solutions, showcasing how the company helps customers electrify their job sites.


Caterpillar's centerpiece exhibit, the Cat R1700 XE LHD underground loader, offers a 16.5-ton payload and 11.2 mph top speed. The zero-exhaust emission loader includes the industry's only onboard battery. Fast-charging, it eliminates having to handle or exchange batteries.


Caterpillar will also display its 301.9 mini excavator, the first machine with a Caterpillar battery.


Caterpillar emphasizes how putting a battery in a machine is just one piece of the puzzle. The trick, says the company in a [blog post](https://www.cat.com/en_US/blog/whats-caterpillar-doing-at-ces-2024.html), is to provide an electric machine to work as productively as the diesel-combustion powered equipment familiar to customers.


These battery-electric powered machines will require more on-site support and resources. Caterpillar aims to solve challenges such as: Where to charge it? How to ensure adequate power capacity? How to manage energy costs? Where to source lower-carbon energy?


CAT Stock No. 1 Among Industry Peers
------------------------------------


In business for nearly 100 years, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.


Caterpillar generated sales of $59.4 billion in 2022. On Oct. 31, the company posted Q3 revenue of $16.8 billion, a 12% gain over the prior-year quarter.


Over the last five quarters, the company has delivered earnings growth ranging from 40% to 75%. Third-quarter earnings per share were $5.52, marking a 40% year-over-year gain.


For the full year 2023, Wall Street forecasts 49% EPS growth to $20.68 a share.


CAT Stock Excavates New Breakout
--------------------------------


With a 93 [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-caterpillar-cat.aspx), CAT stock leads all of its peers in the Machinery-Construction/Mining industry group.


The Dow stock has now cleared a 293.99 buy point and remains in buy range. In the last trading session of the year, Caterpillar showed resilience, ending with a gain for the week and within its new buy zone to close out the 2023 stock market.


While building its latest base, CAT stock has flashed several days of heavy volume, pointing to [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-track-institutional-demand-to-find-winners/). A strong 1.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) and B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) highlight that demand.


As Caterpillar set up, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) turned sharply higher, indicating market leadership.


Look for CAT stock to carry that momentum into the New Year and continue building on its latest breakout move.

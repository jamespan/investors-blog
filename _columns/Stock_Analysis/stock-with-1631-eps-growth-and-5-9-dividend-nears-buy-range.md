Although declines by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and other tech stocks weighed on the market Thursday, private equity fund manager **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) is still trying to launch a breakout move. Industry peers **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) and **T. Rowe Price** ([TROW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TROW)) have also been testing new buy zones.









 
 
 One factor making Apollo attractive to investors is its dividend, currently yielding 5.9% on an annualized basis. Blackstone also has a healthy payout of 6.6%.
Explosive Earnings Growth
-------------------------


Apollo posted an EPS gain of 495% in Q1, bringing its average growth over the past three quarters to 1,631%. (The Q2 gain, however, was calculated from a year-ago loss.) But analysts expect a sharp decline of 48% when the New York City-based company reports Aug. 2.


Sales growth has accelerated in each of the past four quarters, coming in at 433% in Q1. Apollo also sports a 54% annual pretax profit margin and 54% return on equity.


Institutional demand for the stock is reflected in a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and four straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Apollo ranks No. 2 in the investment management industry group. **Noah** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)), Blackstone and T. Rowe Price are also among the group's top five stocks.


Breakout Attempt, Take Two?
---------------------------



On Thursday, Apollo temporarily cleared a 28.52 buy point in a flat base, but pulled back to close below it as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 ran into selling pressure. Volume rose 9% above average, an unimpressive increase for a breakout.


On the positive side, the relative strength line is still within striking distance of new high ground and the 10-day moving average recently climbed back above the 50-day line.


The stock was down over 1% Friday in light volume, as it found support at its 10-day line.


Keep an eye on the overall market and look for Apollo Global Management to retake the buy point in heavy trade. Note that it can be risky to buy any stock just before it reports results, so always have defensive sell rules at the ready in case a stock reverses.

**Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)), which went public in May, develops oil and natural-gas wells in the Permian Basin, primarily in Texas.

  

Sitting on 110,000 acres of prime real estate, Parsley's experience is with more traditional vertical drilling, but it's been ramping up horizontal drilling operations.

  

That lets the company tap more resources, but also increases complexities and costs.

  

Another factor that could affect Parsley and the energy sector as a whole is the possible lifting of the U.S. ban on crude oil exports. Industry experts say that could happen as early as this year, and would open up new markets for domestic producers.

  

**Strength In Numbers**

  

Parsley Energy has shown strong fundamentals, with triple-digit gains for both earnings (100%) and sales (255%) in Q1. Second-quarter results are scheduled for Aug. 12.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 78%, followed by a 105% gain in 2015.

  

Parsley has a strong return on equity of 48%, although that's inflated by $533 million in long-term debt.

  

Its 1.8 Up/Down Volume Ratio indicates solid institutional demand, and 121 funds have reported owning shares in the company since its May 23 IPO.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock rose for three weeks after its market debut, then formed its current flat base, which has corrected no more than 15%.

  

In the 10 weeks Parsley Energy has been trading, volume has generally been heavier on up weeks, a sign of institutional buying.

  

In the third week of June, volume increased as the stock dropped. But that was immediately followed by a heaver up volume week, a sign that big investors snapped up shares.

  

The buy point now stands at 25.80, 10 cents above the left peak of the base.

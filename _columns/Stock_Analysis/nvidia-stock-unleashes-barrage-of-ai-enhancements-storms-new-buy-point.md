When it comes to revolutionary innovations in artificial intelligence and generative AI, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is just getting started.

Nvidia Unveils AI Accelerants
-----------------------------


Aiming to further embed and expand AI technologies, Nvidia has announced two new moves in the AI space.


In a blog post Wednesday, the company said its artificial intelligence platform has [raised the bar for AI training and high-performance computing](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/11/08/scaling-ai-training-mlperf/) in the latest [MLPerf](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/) industry benchmarks. The company also put particular focus on Nvidia Eos, an AI supercomputer powered by a whopping 10,752 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core graphics processing chips and Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking.


Emphasizing the rapidly improving speed of the testing, the company said the Nvidia Eos completed a training benchmark nearly three times faster than the record Nvidia set when the test was introduced less than six months ago.


Earlier in the week, [Nvidia and Amdocs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/amdocs-and-nvidia-to-accelerate-adoption-of-generative-ai-for-1-7-trillion-telecom-industry) also announced they are collaborating to optimize large language models to speed adoption of generative AI applications and services across the $1.7 trillion telecommunications and media industries.


With roughly 30,000 employees around the world, **Amdocs** ([DOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOX)) helps communications and media clients migrate to the cloud and drive the 5G era. Further, the Nvidia-Amdocs collaboration aims to empower communications service providers to efficiently deploy generative AI use cases across their businesses.


Nvidia Stock Charges Into Buy Zone
----------------------------------


With earnings due Nov. 21, Nvidia has now moved past the 476.09 entry.  With a huge run already behind it and the buzz around the AI darling shining brightly, all eyes will soon be on how Nvidia reports — and how Wall Street reacts.


For now, a new market uptrend and emerging Santa Claus rally both continue to boost Nvidia stock, as well as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Apple.


Among the Magnificent Seven stocks, only **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and Google stock remain below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Building on its new climb, Google stock is closing in on the 50-day line, looking to leave [Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-handed-reduce-rating-asev-giant-implements-small-price-hikes-in-china/) as the sole laggard stymied well below that benchmark.


Nvidia now earns a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/) for its powerful [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/), alongside Amazon and Microsoft.

Streaming giant **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) knows a thing or two about building binge-worthy watchlists for its subscribers. Now Netflix has started to pop up as a top stock to watch, albeit in a [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-rules-for-when-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-bull-and-bear-markets/) not currently conducive to making new purchases.


While the [Investor's Business Daily Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/) clearly calls for caution in this environment — even after Wednesday's huge jump on the Nasdaq — Netflix looks to weather the market storm and emerge with newfound strength. Here are four reasons for investors to stay tuned.




1. Top Funds Binge On Netflix Stock
-----------------------------------


While **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and all other [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) remain AWOL, Netflix topped the latest monthly list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-binge-netflix-stock-insurance-stocks-apple-meta-awol/). The sole member of the billion-dollar club on this screen, the stock raked in just under $1.65 billion in capital inflows from these savvy investors.


Other signs of demand for [Netflix stock](https://www.investors.com/research/netflix-rises-above-market-uncertainty-see-new-names-on-ibd-50-stock-spotlight-and-more/) include eight quarters of rising fund ownership. An impressive 288 stocks with an A+ rating from IBD own shares of the company.


Earning the highest-possible [99 Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-nflx.aspx), Netflix has secured a spot on the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and the [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).

2. Earnings On Tap — With Forecasts Of Solid Growth
---------------------------------------------------


On Jan. 21, Netflix reported performance for the fourth quarter, [smashing subscriber estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-nflx-q4-2024-earnings/). Earnings growth spiked 102% to $4.27 per share. Revenue rose 16% to $10.2 billion.


The company is due to report first-quarter results on April 17. Analysts forecast a modest 8% gain in earnings to $5.70 a share, but see a 24% gain to $24.69 per share for the full year. Wall Street estimates a 22% increase in 2026, to $30.16 per share.


3. Relative Strength Line Remains Resilient, Near 52-Week High
--------------------------------------------------------------


While the [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-relative-strength-to-find-breakout-stocks-and-watchlist-candidates/) for bellwether names like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) have waned in this bear market, the RS line for Netflix remains near its 52-week high. That stands as a strong indicator that the streamer continues to outpace the overall market, using the S&P 500 as the benchmark.


As investors hunt for stocks to watch for when a new uptrend emerges, look for those like Netflix showing market-beating relative strength. Such leaders stand poised to climb when the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) make a positive turn.

4. Netflix Stock Flashes Telltale Clue For Chart Readers
--------------------------------------------------------


It's risky to buy any stock in the current market. But strong growth, big demand and market leadership have Wall Street watching Netflix. Another reason the stock could become binge-worthy in a better market comes from this clue for investors who understand [how to read stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/).


From a low it reached in June 2022 until notching an all-time high in February, shares of Netflix soared as much as 548%. Along the way, the stock formed and broke out of multiple bases. Its most recent breakout in January came from a long-in-the-tooth, fifth-stage pattern. Since such consolidations form after a stock has already made a big move, late-stage bases entail more risk.


But Netflix stock flashed a positive sign when it [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-count-bases-to-determine-a-stocks-upside-potential/) earlier this month by undercutting the low in its prior setup. As Netflix — unlike Nvidia, Apple, Tesla and others — holds above its 200-week line, it now appears to be forming a [double-bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#doublebottom).


Much work still needs to be done and the base may not lead to a successful breakout. But the fact that Netflix's next setup will now be first-stage is a positive development. The reset could lead to a fresh run for Netflix stock, especially if the market builds on Wednesday's positive — but still budding — rebound.

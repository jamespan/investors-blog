While all eyes are focused on Friday's earnings reports from **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), investors should also be watching top-rated insurer and financial services stock, **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)).


The Georgia-based provider of term life insurance, mutual funds and annuities is within striking distance of a new buy zone and is scheduled to report Q4 earnings on Feb. 8.


Financial stocks like Primerica, Bank of America, JPMorgan and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) rose sharply after Donald Trump's surprise victory and have been consolidating those gains since the Federal Reserve announced a rate hike last month.


Investors are now waiting to see what kind of numbers the banks and other financial services firms report for the fourth quarter.


Highly-Rated Stock In Highly-Ranked Industry
--------------------------------------------


Primerica's 96 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot in the No. 11-ranked life insurance industry group.


The company insures approximately 5 million lives and has over 2 million client investment accounts, helping it generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenue.


Earnings growth has averaged 22% over the last three quarters and 14% over the last three years.


Sales growth has been in the single digits, ranging from 3% to 8% over the last eight quarters.


Signs of institutional demand include rising fund ownership over the last three quarters and a 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio.


Later-Stage Base
----------------


Trump's election ignited Primerica to a nearly 30% gain for the week ended Nov. 11.


Since then the stock has been trading in a tight range while forming a shallow flat base, just 6% in depth.



It's a third-stage pattern, and such later-stage bases are more prone to failure.


But Primerica's tight trading and good support at the 10-week line may mean it's getting ready to pop past a 73.15 buy point.


The stock inched closer to the buy zone Thursday, closing fractionally higher in below-average, but rising volume.


What happens next will likely depend on how Bank of America, JPMorgan and other financial stocks report this week and what kind of Q4 numbers Primerica releases next month.

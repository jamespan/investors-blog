With the oil and gas exploration industry showing strength, the group's top-ranked stock, **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), is trading just below a potential buy point.


Callon's 99 Composite Rating earns it the No. 1 slot within the No. 9-ranked oil & gas exploration industry group, followed by **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)), **Dorchester Minerals** ([DMLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DMLP)), **Laredo Petroleum** ([LPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPI)) and **Resolute Energy** ([REN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REN)).


Parsley Energy is also within striking distance of a breakout from an early-stage base.


Will Funds Fuel New Climb?
--------------------------


Callon Petroleum made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/new-stock-buys-of-top-mutual-funds-netflix-zions-bancorp-chip-stocks/), with five leading funds investing approximately $8 million from August through October.


An A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and seven straight quarters of rising fund ownership further confirm institutional demand for shares.


The Mississippi-based company is a pure-play oil and gas operator within the Permian Basin in West Texas.


After several quarters of negative or flat top- and bottom-line growth, Callon has shown signs of a rebound.


Earnings growth jumped from 0% to 25% to 80% from Q1 to Q3, while revenue gains accelerated from 1% to 15% to 63% during the same period.


For 2016, analysts expect EPS to rise 87%, followed by a 93% gain in 2017. Analysts have raised estimates for both years.


Renewed Technical Strength
--------------------------


After selling off for four straight weeks starting in October, Callon Petroleum began building the right side of its current cup-shaped base.



In a potentially bullish sign, its relative strength line has entered new high ground as the stock closed Thanksgiving week just below the 16.46 entry.


While building its new pattern, Callon retook its 50-day line and its 10-day moving average got back above its 50-day cousin. Both actions are signs of renewed technical strength.


See if the stock can clear the new buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

The green economy is big business and President Joe Biden's massive [climate change initiatives](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-set-to-pass-democrats-climate-healthcare-and-tax-package-11660296604) will spur that growth. Tapping into those trends, waste management and recycling leader **Waste Connections** ([WCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCN)) aims to fuel a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).




Waste Connections sports a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/). That score in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-waste-connections-inc-wcn.aspx) means it is outpacing 95% of all stocks in terms of the most important [stock-picking traits](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-picks-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).


Fellow leaders in IBD's Pollution Control industry group include **Ceco Environmental** ([CECE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CECE)), **Clean Harbors** ([CLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLH)), **Heritage-Crystal Clean** ([HCCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCCI)) and **Casella Waste Systems** ([CWST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWST)).

Waste Connections Profits With Recycling And Renewables
-------------------------------------------------------


Based in Ontario, Canada, Waste Connections provides nonhazardous waste collection, transfer and disposal services. It also handles resource recovery, primarily through recycling and renewable fuels generation.


The company serves more than 8 million residential, commercial and industrial customers across 43 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces.


In addition, Waste Connections offers nonhazardous oil field waste treatment, recovery and disposal services in several U.S. basins, as well as intermodal services for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the Pacific Northwest.


The green business has a record of solid and steady growth. Over the last six quarters, the company has generated sales growth ranging from 15% to 18%. It generated over [$1.8 billion in revenue](https://investors.wasteconnections.com/2022-08-02-WASTE-CONNECTIONS-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2022-RESULTS-AND-RAISES-FULL-YEAR-OUTLOOK) in Q2 and raised its full year outlook from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion.


WSN stock has a 1.4 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) while boasting six straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 39 funds with an "A+" rating from IBD own shares.


WCN Stock, Industry Peers Pump New Buy Zones
--------------------------------------------


With its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) already hitting a new high, WCN stock is just 3% shy of the 144.56 entry. And, in another sign of rebounding technical strength, its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/) has just moved back above its longer-term 200-day line.


Within the [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), Waste Connections has been holding support along its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It rebounded off its lows Thursday to close right at that benchmark. On Friday, the stock came off its highs but still ended in positive territory and up for the week.


Meanwhile, peers Clean Harbors, Casella Waste Systems and Heritage-Crystal Clean are also exploring new buy points and [buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).


Finally, illustrating how green stocks of a feather tend to flock together, Ceco Environmental gapped up in huge volume on Aug. 8 after reporting 100% EPS growth. It has pulled back in recent days, including a sharp drop in heavy volume Friday.

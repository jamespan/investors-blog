Few stocks remain unscathed in a bear market. But as you build your list of [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) in the next uptrend, focus on stocks like online marketing company **QuinStreet** ([QNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QNST)) that have strong fundamentals and are showing relative strength as the market corrects. Such stocks may be poised to lead in the next bull market.


With an average annual EPS growth rate of 357%, QuinStreet topped a list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/). The Foster City, Calif.-based company also shares the No. 1 ranking in the advertising services industry group with **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), which also made the list of the fastest-growing companies, with average annual earnings growth of 63% over the last three years.

Rising Institutional Demand For Online Marketing Firm

Through its performance marketing technologies, QuinStreet helps clients capture quality clicks at a low cost-per-order. According to the company, it can help marketers reduce their customer acquisition costs by as much as two-thirds.

Top mutual fund managers have taken note, as indicated by five straight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Online Marketing Leader Targets New Run After 275% Climb
--------------------------------------------------------


In August 2017, QuinStreet broke out of a consolidation to launch a 275% run over the next 16 months. The stock is currently working on a [later-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) showing a 17.85 buy point.


Keep in mind that later-stage [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) are more likely to fail, since the stock has already made a big move before they form. That's especially true when the [overall market is in a correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970), making it difficult for any stock to buck the downtrend and move higher.


On the positive side, QuinStreet has been [finding support at its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/), and its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is in new-high ground, a sign of market leadership.


While now is not an ideal time to buy any stock, keep an eye on QuinStreet. It may be setting up to run when a strong new uptrend begins.


As the indexes rebounded to shake off earlier losses Thursday, QuinStreet rose 2.3% to close at 16.38. On Friday, the stockfell 3% to 15.89, leaving it 11% below the 17.85 entry.

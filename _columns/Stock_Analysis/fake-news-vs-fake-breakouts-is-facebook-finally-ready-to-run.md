While **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) founder Mark Zuckerberg looks for a solution to 'fake news,' investors are hoping the social media giant will stop delivering fake breakouts.


Facebook, which has launched several false starts over the last year, is not alone among the [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/tag/fang-stock-news/) in its struggle to move decisively higher.


Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) has struggled to punch through long-term resistance around 820.


**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) made a more decisive move following its April breakout before starting to form a new base in October.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which was featured in the [Jan. 6 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/will-netflix-keep-climbing-stranger-things-could-happen/), kicked off the New Year with a somewhat tepid breakout. On Thursday, the stock gapped up sharply in huge volume after reporting fourth-quarter earnings, but gave back some of those gains to end the day with a 4% gain.


'Strong Buy' In 2017?
---------------------


Earlier this month, Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler gave Facebook a ['strong buy' rating based on high expectations for 2017](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-gets-strong-buy-rating-on-high-expectations-for-2017/).


Powered by 1.79 billion monthly active users (including 1.66 billion mobile users), Team Zuckerberg generated over $7 billion in revenue during a single quarter for the first time in Q3.


Sales growth has come in over 50% for four straight quarters, an impressive feat for a company of Facebook's size.


The social media giant got its mobile act together right as advertising on smartphones was beginning to explode in 2013. Today, advertising makes up about 98% of Facebook's revenue and 84% of that comes from mobile.


Earnings growth has ranged from 83% to 94% over the last three quarters, with analysts expecting a 65% gain in Q4. Facebook reports Feb. 1.


Crossing The Line
-----------------


Facebook reset its base count at the end of last year, making its current flat base a first-stage consolidation.


While its Up/Down Volume Ratio is still below the 1.0 benchmark that indicates demand, the stock has posted two straight up weeks in rising, but below average volume as it nears a 133.60 entry.



The Relative Strength has shown upward momentum, but is still shy of new high ground.


Another technical indicator to watch is the crossing over the 10-week and 40-week moving average lines. See if the 10-week line can get decisively back above its longer-term cousin to show renewed technical strength.


The stock closed marginally lower Thursday in light volume, marking the third day in a potential handle, which takes a minimum of five days to form. If Facebook completes the handle, the buy point would be 129.37.

Arts and crafts chain **Michaels** ([MIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIK)) and cosmetics store operator **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are both members of the specialty retailers industry group, which has jumped from a No. 99 ranking to No. 9 over the last six weeks.


What caused such a sudden rise? Heavy buying by fund managers and other large investors.


Michaels and Ulta Beauty both made IBD’s latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds over the last three months, which will be published in Monday's issue.

Michaels’ 93 Composite Rating earns it the No. 2 spot within the specialty retailers industry group, just behind Ulta Beauty. **Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers** ([RBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBA)), **Party City** ([PRTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRTY)) and **Sally Beauty** ([SBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBH)) round out the top-5 industry leaders.


Michaels’ revenue gains have been modest, ranging from 1% to 6% over the last eight quarters. Earnings growth has come in between 16% and 23% in the last four reports.


The Irving, Texas-based company, which operates 1,168 Michaels stores and 120 Aaron Brothers locations, is expected to report earnings for its fiscal 2016 first quarter, which ended in April, on June 2.


Near Buy Point With Rising RS Line
----------------------------------


After going public in 2014, Michaels formed a pair of bases that launched a more-than-60% gain in just five months.

Tight trading in recent weeks and a rising Relative Strength line ahead a possible breakout are both bullish signs.


But remember that individual stocks do not operate in a vacuum, and the general market has come under selling pressure in recent weeks.


If you buy into any breakouts in this type of environment, be sure to have a defensive plan in place in case the trade goes against you.

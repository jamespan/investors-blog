**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-apple-nvidia-microsoft/). Now VRTX stock is nearing a new buy point with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) already hitting a new 52-week high.




The leading biotech stock joins industry peer **Regeneron Pharmaceutical** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Vertex has also secured a spot on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/best-growth-stocks-to-buy-stock-market-research/).


In this month's list of new buys by top funds, leading money managers invested an estimated $408 million in VRTX stock. That dwarfed the amounts put into all other biotech stocks on the list, including Regeneron, **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Exelixis** ([EXEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXEL)), **Alkermes** ([ALKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALKS)) and 2020 [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)).


Vertex Explores Pipeline Beyond Cystic Fibrosis
-----------------------------------------------


Based in Boston's Innovation District, Vertex specializes in treatments for [cystic fibrosis](https://www.vrtx.com/cystic-fibrosis/understanding-cf/). But through a robust pipeline of investigational small molecule, cell and genetic therapies, the leading biotech also has clinical trials underway for other [chronic conditions](https://www.vrtx.com/research-development/pipeline/), including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, pain, and Type 1 diabetes.


On Jan. 26, Vertex posted [Q4 and full year results](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-reports-fourth-quarter-2021-and-full-year-financial), generating $7.57 billion in revenue, an increase of 22% over 2020. For the quarter, sales rose 27% to over $2 billion.


Over the last three years, Vertex has posted average annual earnings growth of 53%. The company has now delivered four consecutive years of EPS growth.


In [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-vertex-pharmaceuticals-vrtx.aspx), Vertex earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. The company sports a 56.4% annual pretax profit margin and a 36% return on equity, with only a 5% debt-to-equity ratio.


VRTX Stock Takes Aim At New Breakout
------------------------------------


Vertex is setting up a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) with a 255.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as the market starts a new uptrend.


On March 11, Vertex flashed a negative reversal, but the base remains intact. Volume on that down day was light, a sign that large investors were not dumping shares.


The decline within the current base was just 12%, and VRTX stock found support at both its [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). In a sign of market leadership, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for Vertex is already at a new high ahead of its potential [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


While the biotech industry group ranks a lowly No. 141 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks, Vertex and other industry leaders are showing strength. Fellow biotech Regeneron has broken out and remains in a buy zone. Harmony Biosciences, which earns a spot on [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/),  retook an earlier entry in strong volume and is now extended.

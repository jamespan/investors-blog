As the **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) IPO continues to disappoint and **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) kicks off its stock market debut, the April initial public offering of **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) has gotten off to a promising start. But now it's approaching a crucial test many IPO stocks face.




As Lyft, **Cronos** ([CRON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRON)), **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and many other IPO stocks have shown year after year, it's [risky to buy new issues](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/uber-ipo-lyft-facebook-alibaba-how-to-buy-ipo-stocks/) right when they go public. You're better off waiting for the stock to offer a lower-risk entry by breaking out of an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) before you invest.


Tradeweb is currently forming such a [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), showing a potential 44.35 buy point. See if the operator of electronic marketplaces can decisively clear that entry in heavy volume.

IPO Stocks To Watch: Tradeweb Stock Eyes Buy Point
--------------------------------------------------


In recent weeks, fellow IPO stocks **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) have also made encouraging market debuts. Beyond Meat has yet to form an IPO base, and has been pulling back in recent days. Meanwhile Pinterest appears to be setting up a its firs consolidation with a 35.39 buy point. The social media stock flashed a negative reversal during the week ended May 3, and is currently trading well below that entry.


Since jumping out of the gate with two up weeks, Tradeweb has been building a relatively controlled IPO base. Its relative strength has been trending higher as it tries to clear the buy point.


In addition to the fact that IPOs can be particularly volatile, also keep in mind that the market outlook is currently "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market-start-with-a-simple-routine/)" — meaning it's a time to be cautious about making any new buys because the market may roll over into a correction.


While still a very young stock with a limited trading history, Tradeweb sports a strong 4.5 up/down volume ratio, well above the 1.0 level that indicates demand.


The stock closed at 43 to mark a nearly 10% gain for the week, leaving it 3% below the 44.35 buy point.



Tradeweb Among Group Of Profitable IPO Stocks To Watch
------------------------------------------------------


While it's not unusual for IPO stocks such as Uber and Lyft to go public before they're profitable, Tradeweb is already generating earnings. The company has generated EPS growth of 10% to 53% over the last four quarters, but note that earnings growth has been slowing. Revenue gains have ranged from 17% to 56% over the last five reports.


Cash flow is also strong at $6.25 per share.


Since being featured as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tradeweb-stock-ipo-base-buy-point-lyft-pinterest-losses/) on April 24, Tradeweb's Composite Rating has risen from an 86 to a 90. See if that rating, which tracks the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), can rise to a 95, the elite benchmark that earns a passing rating in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).

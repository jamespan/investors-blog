Fintech Stocks On IBD 50
------------------------


Five of the six top-rated fintech stocks in the credit card and payment processing group have earned spots on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Green Dot, PayPal, Mastercard, Euronet Worldwide and Visa all made this list of today's best growth stocks. Only Square didn't make the cut.


Green Dot has a track record of strong earnings growth, ranging from 28% to 104% over the last eight quarters. In Q3, EPS accelerated to a 74% increase, up from a 35% gain in Q2. Analysts expect a 68% rise in earnings when Green Dot reports Q4 numbers next month.


Fund managers have taken note. The stock has seen two quarters of rising fund ownership, and 32 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-reit-stocks-medical-stocks/) with an A+ rating have a position in Green Dot stock.


Fintech Stocks Reset Base Count
-------------------------------


As [many newer IPO stocks do](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-stocks-dropbox-facebook-alibaba-snap-square-how-to-invest/), Green Dot struggled after initially rising following its July 2010 stock market debut. But starting in late 2016, Green Dot launched a new move that led to a 273% gain until the stock peaked last September.


It then pulled back to form a new consolidation. It tried to break out, but ended up retreating again to form its current base. While building that new chart pattern, Green Dot [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) by undercutting the low in the prior consolidation. That makes its current double bottom a first-stage base. The buy point is 85.75.


PayPal similarly reset its base count last October, and is now approaching a new buy point in a first-stage base.


Green Dot's relative strength line is floating just below a new 52-week high. In another sign of technical strength, the stock is above its 10-week line, and that benchmark moving average has remained above its longer-term 40-week line.


On Tuesday, the stock rose 1.4% to 83.11, but in light volume. The stock is now 3% below the entry. See if it can clear the buy point in volume at least 40% higher than normal.

With global e-commerce growing at double digit rates, logistics leaders **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) see increasing demand for their package delivery services. They may also face new competition from a major customer: online retail giant **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Fueling Growth With TNT
-----------------------


In May, [FedEx announced it was acquiring TNT Express](https://www.tnt.com/express/en_gb/site/home/the-company/press/press_releases/Fedex-acquires-tnt-express.html), one of the world's largest express delivery companies, with road and air services in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. TNT generated €6.9 billion in revenue in 2015 (approximately $7.6 billion at current exchange rates).


Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the acquisition will FedEx's ability to support business connections around the world. The move should also help the Memphis-based company continue to boost sales growth, which jumped 19% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which ended on Aug. 31.


Earnings growth has ranged from 19% to 24% over the last four quarters. Analyst expect EPS to rise 12% pop in the current quarter and increase 13% for full fiscal year.


Will Amazon Take On FedEx And UPS?
----------------------------------


Earlier this year, Amazon announced it was procuring a fleet of 40 airline freighters to [reduce its dependence on FedEx and UPS](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/will-amazons-transportation-fleet-put-the-hammer-on-fedex-ups/). The e-commerce giant said it plans to have the fleet fully operational by 2018.


Amazon has said its goal is to add capacity to supplement delivery services from FedEx and UPS. But in September, the [Wall Street Journal reported](http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-newest-ambitioncompeting-directly-with-ups-and-fedex-1474994758) that current and former Amazon managers say the e-commerce giant has bigger plans that may include more extensively delivering its own packages and those of other retailers.


New Breakout Delivered; Now What?
---------------------------------


As the market rallied Monday following nine straight down sessions on the S&P 500, FedEx gapped up 3% in heavy volume to enter a 177.36 - 186.33 buy zone as its Relative Strength line moved solidly into new high ground.



On Election Day Tuesday, the package delivery giant added to its gains in above average volume, closing the day within the buy zone.


Now investors face two questions.


With voters and investors waiting to see if Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the next president, will the nascent market rebound spark a sustained rally? And will FedEx's new breakout take hold or will it stumble and stall as many breakouts have in recent months?


Trading volume is a key factor to watch to help answer both questions. Two heavy-volume up days on the breakout is a good sign for FedEx, but stay nimble as the election results may drive the market either up or down.

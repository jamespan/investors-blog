Helping local governments manage documents may not sound sexy, but it's been a profitable and growing business for **Tyler Technologies** ([TYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYL)).


The Plano, Texas-based company earned a spot on the Forbes list of "**[Most Innovative Growth Companies 2016](http://www.forbes.com/growth-companies/list/)**," which ranked enterprises by their innovation premium – i.e., the difference between their market capitalization and the net present value of cash flow.


**Athenahealth** ([ATHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHN)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Boston Beer** ([SAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAM)) also made the list, as did three companies that were buyout targets over the last three months: **NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N)), bought by **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) in July; **Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)), acquired by **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) in August; and **Cepheid** ([CPHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPHD)), purchased by **Danaher** ([DHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHR)) earlier this week.

Tyler Technologies broke out in October 2014, rising as much as 88% before pulling back sharply at the beginning of this year.


 The silver lining of that decline was how the stock **[reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx)**, potentially paving the way for a fresh, new run.
Tyler cleared a first-stage **[cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787)** entry in late June, but soon pulled back to begin forming its current consolidation – a flat base as part of a first-stage base-on-base pattern.


Trading within the formation has been very tight in recent weeks, with support along the 10-week moving average.


Institutional demand for shares is reflected in the stock's 1.7 Up/Down Volume Ratio and B Accumulation/Distribution Rating.


See if Tyler Technologies can clear the 171.51 buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

With the market in a correction, it's important to watch for any sell signals your stocks may be flashing. **Tibco Software** ([TIBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIBX)), which develops networking and business process management software, recently flashed some classic warning signs.

  

For much of May, the stock found support at the 10-week moving average 1.

  

But that support soon evaporated. In early June, Tibco fell below the line 2 in heavy trading.

  

That was a key sell signal because the heavy volume showed institutional investors were dumping shares. Since then, the stock has continued to slide, although it bounced back a bit on Monday.

  

The stock has also dropped more than 7% below the buy point for the square-box base it broke out of in March 3.

  

That's another key sell signal: Always sell if a stock drops 7% to 8% below your purchase price.

  

When it peaked, Tibco had about tripled from a breakout in March 2010. After such a heady climb, it's reasonable to expect at least a moderate correction in a leading stock. Tibco's bases since then were short and fairly shallow.

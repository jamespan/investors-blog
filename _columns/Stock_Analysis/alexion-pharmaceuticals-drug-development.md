**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) developed and distributes Soliris, its sole FDA-approved commercial drug, which treats two types of rare blood disorders.

  

In October, the FDA awarded breakthrough therapy designation for ALXN1101, a new drug Alexion is developing to treat hypophosphatasia, or HPP, an ultrarare metabolic disorder.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Quarterly earnings and sales growth have been consistently strong over the past few years.

  

In the first quarter, earnings jumped 135%. Sales growth accelerated from 35% to 36%, 38% and 67% the past three quarters.

  

Alexion reports second-quarter earnings Thursday before the market opens.

  

Alexion sports a strong 29% return on equity and a 96 Composite Rating, highest among the 324 stocks in the Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.

  

But institutional demand has lagged a bit recently, as indicated by a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating and an 0.8 up/down volume ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

In October, strong third-quarter earnings and the FDA ruling on ALXN1101 sparked a 55% run until the stock peaked in March.

  

Like other biotechs, Alexion sold off sharply on heavy volume on March 21, when House Democrats questioned the high price of Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.

  

The stock bottomed near its 40-week moving average in April and has since been working on a cup-with-handle base. The ideal buy point is 172.60 . Watch to see if Alexion can break out of that pattern on heavy volume. Keep in mind the market is under pressure, making new stock buys more risky.

Today were going to look at **Constant Contact** ([CTCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTCT)), which helps companies reach out to customers.

  

Their marketing products let their clients create, send and track email. And their social media products help customers launch outreach campaigns on Facebook.

  

They were profiled in a Nov. 7 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/110613-678169-constant-contact-refocuses-on-email-and-social.htm), which noted about 70% of their clients are small organizations with less than 10 employees.

  

Their customers can use Constant Contact's event market product to promote and manage events.

  

They also offer online surveys. In addition, their SaveLocal tool helps their clients create and manage local deals.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings growth slowed last year and in the first part of 2013, but could be turning around. 

  

• Earnings were up 45% last quarter. 

  

• Sales growth ranged from 13% to 15% the past four quarters. Remember you like to see sales growth of at least 25%. 

  

• Looking ahead, analysts predict earnings will rise 30% this year and 29% next year. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-constant-contact-inc-ctct.aspx) shows Constant Contact's 96 Composite Rating is the best among the 30 stocks in the Commercial Services-Advertising industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 45 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock broke out of this base in September and launched a new climb.

  

It's now too far extended past its ideal buy point to get into safely. But it may be one to keep on your watch list to see if it pauses and pulls back to the 50-day line or gives investors other opportunities to get onboard.

  

So that's a quick look at Constant Contact. And that's the New America Analysis for Tues. Nov. 19.

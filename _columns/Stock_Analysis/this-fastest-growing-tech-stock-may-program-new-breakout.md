When you think of today's fastest-growing tech stocks, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) and **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) may come to mind. But don't ignore fellow fast-grower **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).
The maker of cloud-based software solutions for the life sciences industry made IBD's recent list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/), as well the most recent [Forbes' Fast Tech 25](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/04/20/these-are-the-25-fastest-growing-public-tech-companies/#25dc194b5131) screen.


Facebook and GrubHub also earned a spot on both lists.


Top Ranking In Lowly Group
--------------------------


Veeva Systems, which went public in 2013, holds the No. 1 spot within the medical software industry, but the group ranks a lowly No. 162 among the 197 groups that IBD tracks.


The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member has generated a 67% five-year annual EPS growth rate and 48% average earnings gain over the past three quarters. Revenue has been rising at a 36% average annual clip over the last three years.


[Veeva Systems beat on both the top and bottom lines](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/veeva-systems-growth-continues-but-income-guidance-hits-stock/) when it reported fiscal 2017 Q4 numbers on Feb. 28, but income guidance fell short of analyst expectations.


The number of funds with a position in the stock has risen for eight straight quarters.


From Yellow Flags To Green Light?
---------------------------------


Veeva was featured in the [May 20 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/veeva-systems-q1-earnings-cloud-software-lifesciences/), just as it broke out to launch a 51% gain in under four months.


The stock then formed a new base and broke out in November on earnings, but flashed a bearish reversal the very next week.



While building its current consolidation, Veeva has generally found support near the prior 42.68 buy point and along its 10-week moving average.


The stock fell sharply in early trading Wednesday, but rebounded in heavy volume to close nearly 3% higher and above its 50-day line.


Such volatile action, combined with post-earnings reversal in November, is a reason to proceed with caution.


But the stock held support at its 10-day line again on Friday as it tries to close in on a 48.05 entry.

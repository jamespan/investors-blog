**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is stretching recent gains as healthy overall ratings help make it one of the top retail stocks to watch. The fact that it's still in a buy range doesn't hurt, either.




[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup) assigns the Vancouver-based yogawear chain a highest-possible 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), a tool that gives investors a quick way to gauge a stock's key metrics. That puts the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and [IBD 50 stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) at the top of the 41-stock apparel and shoe retailing group.


Lulu's 99 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/), one of the components of the composite score, is also best in its group. That reflects a five-year compound earnings growth rate of 19%. Analysts expect a 23% jump for the current fiscal year, which ends in January, and a 19% increase the next.


Lululemon Stock Among Top Retail Stocks To Watch
------------------------------------------------


An A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) (sales + profit margins + return on equity) means Lululemon is in the top 20% based on those gauges. A 21.8% pretax margin last year (fiscal 2019) was the highest in four years, while a 33.8% ROE was its best since fiscal 2013. Its average sales growth rate over the past three quarters was 22.7%.


A B- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) suggests slightly more recent net buying than selling by mutual funds. Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) were among highly regarded funds owning shares in Q3. At least seven other A or A+ rated mutual funds increased their stakes in that period.


Lululemon stock has run up as much as 68% this year. As it rebounds from a recent pullback, the stock closed Friday up 66% year to date, well ahead of the S&P 500's 18% return. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has climbed near record highs, a bullish sign.


On Sept. 6, fueled by a [strong Q2 report and guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q2-2019-lululemon-stock-near-buy/), the stock gapped up past a 194.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in busy trade. It got as high as 5% from the entry that day, before easing the next session.


Will Lululemon Stock Break Out Again?
-------------------------------------


The stock has since pulled back into buy range, and sometimes below the buy point. It tested and found support at its 50-day moving average last week, a hopeful sign.


The [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/)Â marked its third base this year, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) chart analysis. Yet, the base is still considered early stage. A 33% correction last year from September to December [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). And since Lulu stock didn't advance more than 20% between breakouts, the three bases are technically first stage.


Leading stocks often make their biggest runs out of such [early-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). Keep in mind, however, that all purchases are riskier than normal with the market uptrend under pressure.

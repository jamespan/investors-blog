**Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) operates over 80 stores offering decorative hardware, bath fixtures, furniture and lighting. It's currently shedding smaller stores to focus on large-format locations to better showcase its products, increase sales and improve operating margins.

  

It recently opened large-scale design galleries in Greenwich, Conn., and New York City, with plans for new stores in Los Angeles and Atlanta later this year.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth accelerated in fiscal Q1, jumping from 30% to 200%. After slowing recently, sales growth also moved higher, from 18% to 22%. Restoration is scheduled to release fiscal Q2 numbers Sept. 8.

  

Restoration's three-year annual growth rate is a stellar 102%, helping it earn a 98 IBD Composite Rating. It also sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a strong 2.0 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Restoration's stock got off to a slow start following its November 2012 return to the stock market, but it launched a big move in May 2013, essentially doubling in just 2 months.

  

It then formed a series of failed consolidations, hitting lower lows within those bases.

  

The stock found its footing in June and broke out of a first-stage base on volume 595% above average.

  

It rose around 24% before pulling back to form its current second-stage flat base with a 94.60 buy point.

  

After recapturing its 10-week moving average this week, the stock edged back toward that line on Thursday. It rebounded Friday in heavier volume and is now 6% below the buy point.

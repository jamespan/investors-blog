Artificial intelligence (AI). IoT. The Cloud. Self-driving cars. 5G. Through its [semiconductor chips](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) and software, **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) is helping drive a wide-ranging so-called "smart" technology revolution. And Synopsys stock may be setting up a buy point along the way.




Based in the heart of Silicon Valley, Synopsys has been in business for over 30 years, has more than $3 billion in revenue, and employs north of 13,000 employees. It designs and verifies the chips and processes to manufacture smartphones, wearables, self-driving cars and machines that learn from experience.


[Synopsys partners](https://www.synopsys.com/community/partners.html) include Samsung, ARM Holdings (owned by **Softbank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY))), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).

Will Rising EPS Push Synopsys Stock Higher?
-------------------------------------------


Synopsys stock has been on the rise since coming out of a base in March. The [AI stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) has gotten a boost from rising earnings growth in recent quarters. EPS has improved from a 2% decline to a 24% increase over the last three reports.


While Synopsys stock carries an unimpressive D+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), it has shown three quarters of rising fund ownership. Look for the D+ rating to reach a C or better as the stock hopefully completes its new base.


Can AI Stock Synopsys Design New Breakout?
------------------------------------------


As the company works on self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and other smart technology, Synopsys stock is getting within striking distance of a new breakout.


It's currently 4% below a 146.76 entry in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). In recent days and weeks, the stock has been [finding support at its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners-trend-moving-averages-support-nvidia-netflix/).


Look for Synopsys stock to punch through the buy point in volume at least 40% above average to show conviction in the move.


On Friday, Synopsys fell over 2% and had skidded below its 10-week line. It did manage to come slightly off its bottom by the end of the day. Look for the AI leader to show resilience and retake its 50-day benchmark.

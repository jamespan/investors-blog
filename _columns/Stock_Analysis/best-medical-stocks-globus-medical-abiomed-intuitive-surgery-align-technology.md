**Globus Medical** ([GMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMED)) is one of the top medical stocks to watch. And along with [IBD 50 members](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) and **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)), it's among the five stocks in the medical products industry group that have the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.




A 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/) means a stock is outperforming 99% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


The No. 11-ranked medical products group has a deep bench, as shown by 32 more industry leaders that sport a 95 or higher Composite Rating, including da Vinci Surgical System maker **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), which makes Invisalign clear braces.


High-Margin Medical Stock
-------------------------


While Globus Medical's sales and earnings growth are below the [ideal stock-picking benchmarks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/) you look for, they did accelerate in Q4. Earnings-per-share jumped from 3% to 23%, while revenue rose 16% from a year ago and up from a 12% gain in the third quarter.


Globus Medical is set to report Q1 earnings on May 2.


Boosted by a 29% annual pretax profit margin, Globus Medical earns an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-judge-a-companys-sales-in-a-vacuum-use-the-smr-rating-to-judge-growth/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole. Abiomed, Inogen and Intuitive Surgical also have an A SMR Rating, while Neogen earns a B.


Founded in 2003 and based in Audoban, Pa., Globus Medical manufactures musculoskeletal implants to help patients with spine disorders.


In March, the company entered the orthopedic trauma market, followed by the launch of its ELSA Expandable Lateral Spacer System earlier this month.

Testing Buy Point With Earnings Due
-----------------------------------


Globus Medical is testing the 52.28 buy point in a flat base. It originally cleared the entry on April 23 in volume 40% higher than normal.


Since then, the stock has shown resilience as the general market came under selling pressure. Globus Medical stayed above its 50-day moving average and its relative strength line continues to float near new-high ground. On Friday, the stock slipped 0.5% to 51.74, putting it 1% below the entry.


Globus Medical's B+ Accumulation/Distributions Rating and 1.3 up/down volume ratio indicate institutional demand for the stock. But keep in mind that it's risky to buy any stock ahead of its next earnings report.



Abiomed is trying to retake a 304.38 entry in a later-stage base. Intuitive Surgical is also trying to recharge its recent breakout attempt, while Align Technology is trying to get back above its 50-day line.

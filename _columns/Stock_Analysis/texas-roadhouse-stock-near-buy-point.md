As it nears a new buy point, **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) hopes its stock will begin to sizzle just like its hand-cut steaks.

  

The chain of Southern-style steakhouses has felt the heat of higher food costs that has also put pressure on fellow restaurant stocks such as **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Papa Murphy's** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)).

  

But as [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/052215-753965-texas-roadhouse-margins-should-improve-when-costs-fall.htm) noted, Texas Roadhouse managed to absorb most of the added expense better than some industry peers, raising menu prices just 1.8%. By contrast, Chipotle Mexican Grill hiked prices by more than 6% last year.

  

Texas Roadhouse has more than 430 restaurants in 49 states, serving up such delicacies as Rattlesnake Bites and its famous Road Kill steak.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After a slowdown in sales in Q4, revenue growth accelerated in the first quarter to 16%. Earnings growth also popped, from 8% to 24%.

  

For both 2015 and 2016, analysts expect EPS to rise 18%. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Texas Roadhouse pays a dividend yielding 1.8% and management owns 10% of shares. That's positive, since it means key executives have a vested interest in the company's success.

  

Overall, the stock has a 92 Composite Rating and the interest of institutional investors.

  

It sports a solid B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and the number of funds that own shares has been on the rise in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Starting in October 2013, Texas Roadhouse's stock fell into a long slump that it didn't come out of until a year later when it reported Q3 earnings.

  

Shares rose more than 30% over the next four months before starting to form its current consolidation, a flat base that's part of a second-stage base-on-base.

  

Several weeks of tight closes in the right side of the base and two up weeks in heavy volume are healthy signs of institutional support and accumulation.

  

The [buy point](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-2-minute-tips/689816-how-to-determine-a-stockand8217s-ideal-buy-point.aspx) is 38.52, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if Texas Roadhouse can climb past that price on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

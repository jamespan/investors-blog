While payment processing stocks like **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) may garner more attention, IBD 50 member **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) may be fueling up for a new breakout.




FleetCor, which was [recently added to the IBD 50 and IBD Big Cap 20 lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-planet-fitness-joins-ibd-50/), rose nearly 4% this week, putting it just 2% below a 213.84 buy point. (You can see which stocks were just added to — or removed from — IBD's screens with the new [IBD Stock Lists Update](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/best-growth-stocks-buy-watch-ibd-stock-lists/) daily column.)


Mastercard, Visa and PayPal are also working on new bases, while Square has rebounded from a recent pullback that resulted in a round-trip sell signal.

Fueling Partnerships With Uber, Chevron, Mastercard
---------------------------------------------------


Based in Peachtree Corners, Ga., FleetCor Technologies is a global provider of payment tracking and processing solutions for commercial fleets, oil companies and petroleum marketers.


[FleetCor's roster of clients](http://www.fleetcor.com/our_business-by_business.htm) includes Uber, **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), Mastercard, **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) and Arco.


Boosted by a 52% annual pretax profit margin and 23.6% return on equity, FleetCor scores a 97 Composite Rating, earning it the No. 3 ranking in the payment processing industry group.


Mastercard, PayPal, Square and [leading 2018 IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) are also among the industry's top-rated stocks.


Driving New Breakout Move?
--------------------------


FleetCor is expected to report Q1 earnings on April 30, with analysts looking for a 20% rise in earnings-per-share. In Q4, FleetCor showed a jump from 14% to 27%. Revenue gains dipped from 19% to 18%.


Heading into its Q1 earnings report, FleetCor's relative strength line is at a 52-week high as the stock bounces off its 50-day line.


FleetCor's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.4 up/down volume ratio and two quarters of rising fund ownership show demand for shares. Including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)), 122 mutual funds with an A+ rating have reported a position in the stock.


In early trading Monday, FleetCor is edging higher, putting it within about 1% of the 2013.84 buy point. Also note that the shorter-term 10-day moving average has climbed back above that longer-term benchmark line, a sign of renewed technical strength.


See if the general market can bounce back from Friday's sell-off and see if FleetCor can clear the buy point in heavy volume.

As **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) tries to rev its engines after skidding lower, fellow [automotive industry stock](https://www.investors.com/news/automotive-industry-news-self-driving-cars-and-stocks-to-watch/) **Meritor** ([MTOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTOR)) is trying motor back into the buy zone it initially entered on Feb. 1.


 In December, Barron's reported that Piper Jaffray chose Meritor and GM as their [top stock picks in the automotive sector](https://www.barrons.com/articles/get-it-in-gear-why-gm-meritor-tesla-can-keep-climbing-1512763142).


Based in Troy, Mich., Meritor is a global supplier of drivetrain, braking and aftermarket solutions for the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The [IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) traces its roots back more than 100 years, and now has approximately 8,200 employees operating in 19 countries.


General Motors reported Q4 earnings on Feb. 6, posting a 32% jump in EPS growth. The stock has been rising on the news, and is trying to get back above its 50-day line.


No. 1-Ranked Stock In Industry
------------------------------


After three straight quarters of declining earnings growth, Meritor has hit the accelerator, driving average EPS gains of 80% over the last three reports, including a 148% spike in fiscal 2018 Q1, ended Dec. 31.


Sales growth has also picked up after an extended slump, with revenue rising from a 2% decline to a 29% gain over the last four reports. For fiscal Q1, revenue came in at  $903 million.


With the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Meritor now earns top ranking within the Automotive-Original Equipment Manufacturers (OE M) industry group.


**Modine** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)), which makes thermal management systems for autos and other markets, made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/new-buys-by-top-funds-bofa-returns-but-apple-goes-missing/), and shares the No. 2 spot with seating and electrical systems maker **Lear** ([LEA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEA)) with a 98 rating.


Like Meritor, Modine and fifth-ranked **Allison Transmission** ([ALSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALSN)) are also testing recent buy zones.


Resilience In Face Of Market Sell-Off
-------------------------------------


Meritor bolted higher on its big earnings beat, posting a nearly 14% gain on Jan. 31, followed by an 8% rise the next day.


While [big sell-offs in the Dow on Friday and Monday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-slaughtered-as-fear-gauge-surges-more-downside-ahead/) stalled Meritor's advance, the stock has shown resilience and continues to trade just below the 28.06 buy point.



In a sign of market leadership, the relative strength line remains near new high ground. Note also how Meritor has shown signs of institutional demand, including a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.1 up/down volume ratio and six quarters of rising fund ownership.


So while recent market volatility makes it risky to buy any stock right now, if the indexes can rebound and resume their climb, Meritor may be poised to keep on trucking higher.

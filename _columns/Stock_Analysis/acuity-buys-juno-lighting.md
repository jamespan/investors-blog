On the heels of an earnings beat on Oct. 7 and a breakout on Oct. 21, **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) said that it will buy Juno Lighting Group, sending its stock to an all-time high Friday.

  

Juno is a unit of Schneider Electric and provides downlighting and track-lighting fixtures for residential and commercial use.

  

The purchase extends Acuity's lineup of energy-efficient LED, OLED (organic LED) and other lighting solutions for both indoor and outdoor use.

  

In September, Acuity announced completion of its acquisition of Distech Controls, helping position itself to profit from the rise of smart homes and increasing demand for [Internet of Things connectivity](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/100715-774558-acuity-brands-tops-invests-internet-of-things.htm).

  

Competitors in the lighting space include **Eaton** ([ETN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETN)), **Philips** ([PHG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHG)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).

  

**Key Numbers**

  

Sales growth has ranged from 12% to 15% over the past seven quarters, while earnings growth in the four most recent quarters has come in above the 25% minimum [that CAN SLIM investors](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) look for .

  

Analysts have recently revised estimates for fiscal 2016 and 2017 upward.

  

Fund ownership has risen in recent quarters. Five top mutual funds have a position in the stock, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons and Fidelity Contrafund .

  

Acuity's 98 Composite Rating ranks No. 2 in the construction products industry group, behind **Fortune Brands Home & Security** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)). The group ranked No. 21 among 197 industries in Friday's edition.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Following a steady, seven-month climb right along its 10-week line, Acuity pulled back in August to form a [double-bottom base](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/facebook-ambarella-breakouts-ibd-investing-show-excerpt/).

  

Acuity broke out Oct. 21, but the stock's volume was just 22% above average. It remained within buy range for several days before shooting higher Friday on news of the Juno buyout.

After climbing 257% from a breakout in November 2016, cloud networking leader **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) retreated sharply as a bear market took hold at the end of last year. But the **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) partner is now trying to launch a new run.




As a pioneer of software-drive, cognitive cloud networking for large-scale data centers, Arista's technology partners include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure, as well as **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), and Google Cloud from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


With its headquarters in San Francisco, Arista Networks also has locations in Bangalore, Vancouver, Singapore, and Ireland, serving over 5,000 customers worldwide. The company has shipped more than 20 million cloud networking ports worldwide with CloudVision and EOS, Arista's advanced networking operating system.

Cloud Networking Leader
-----------------------


With a 98 Composite Rating, Arista Networks ranks No. 1 among its cloud networking peers. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) comes in at No. 2 with an 89 rating.


Boosted by strong annual average growth rates for both sales (39%) and earnings (54%) over the last three years, Arista has earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) screens, both of which have a proven track record of [outperforming the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/).


Arista's 36% annual pretax profit margin and 34% return on equity show it is an efficiently run and strongly profitable company. While it didn't make IBD's latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-splunk-stock-netflix-stock/), the stock's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.2 up/down volume ratio point to strong demand for shares.


Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) has reported a position in Arista Networks stock.

Cloud Stocks To Watch: Will First-Stage Base Lift Arista?
---------------------------------------------------------


Following its huge run-up from November 2016 to August 2018, Arista pulled back to form a chart pattern with a 40% decline. While consolidating, the stock undercut the low in its prior pattern to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), making its current [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) a first-stage pattern.


In the right side of the base, Arista gapped up to a nearly 10% gain on Feb. 15 following its Q4 earnings report. Volume was 366% above average. It's bullish to see such signs of institutional buying within a chart pattern.


Arista cleared the 269.59 buy point on Feb. 19, again on good volume (113% higher than normal).


On Tuesday, the stock fell 2.3% in above-average volume to 277.82, bringing it back into buy range, which extends to 283.07.  While you don't want to buy any stock on the way down, see if Arista Networks can find support and reverse higher in strong trade.

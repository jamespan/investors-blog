**Packaging Corp. of America** ([PKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKG)), also known as PCA, makes packaging for the paper, agricultural and food and beverage markets.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

For the past three quarters, earnings growth ranged from 65% to 70%, and sales growth rose from 17% to 90%. Part of the boost comes from PCA's acquisition of Boise in October. Second-quarter results are expected July 14.

  

PCA has a solid 27% three-year EPS growth rate, and analysts expect earnings to rise 41% this year and 17% in 2015. The company pays a dividend with an annualized yield of 2.3%.

  

A strong 28% return on equity helps the stock earn a solid 96 Composite Rating.

  

Its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates a modestly higher amount of institutional buying vs. selling in recent weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

From a low in June 2012 until March , PCA nearly tripled in price, finding support along its 10-week moving average and building several "stepping stones" by turning former areas of resistance into areas of support.

  

In March, PCA fell below the 10-week line, but it later found support at its prior area of resistance, around the 65 price level. Watching for that support can help you sit tight and not get shaken out by daily fluctuations.

  

That's positive behavior, but keep in mind that the stock has already made a big move, and the current cup-with-handle pattern is a third-stage base. Such later-stage formations can lead to nice gains, but they do carry more risk. The ideal buy point is 71.96, or 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

Another risk is the slack Relative Price Strength line, which was well below its prior peak when PCA bolted up on its Q4 profit report. You prefer to see the line, which compares a stock's performance to the S&P 500, confirm or lead a breakout to new highs.

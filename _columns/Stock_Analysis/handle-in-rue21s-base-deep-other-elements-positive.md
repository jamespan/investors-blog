Since going public in November 2009, **Rue21** ([RUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUE)) has had a choppy ride and has yet to make a clear and sustained climb.

  

But the apparel chain is forming a possible cup-with-handle base 1.

  

The handle consists of a 15% decline, which is a bit deep for a handle. Volume hasn't been quiet in the handle area, which is another concern 2.

  

Distribution in the base (basically, the number of down weeks in above-average volume) is slightly more than the accumulation in the pattern so far. At the same time, the cup portion of the base included several weeks of tight price closes, which is a positive sign.

  

Another bullish sign is the up/down volume ratio 3, which is not only high but trending higher in recent weeks.

  

The Relative Price Strength Rating is lower than what you normally find in leading stocks. Rue21 is still basing though and the rating could come up before a breakout.

  

The daily chart shows two gap-ups in the base. Those indicate strong demand.

  

The potential buy point is 34.93, or 10 cents above the 34.83 peak in the handle 4.

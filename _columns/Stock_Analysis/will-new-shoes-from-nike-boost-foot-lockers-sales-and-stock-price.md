Athletic footwear and apparel retailer Foot Locker has over 3,500 locations across 30 countries.

  

Helped by popular brands such as **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), the retailer rode the back-to-school shopping wave to strong same-store sales growth in September.

  

**Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) may also get a jump on holiday sales with new Michael Jordan and LeBron James basketball shoes from Nike, which are hitting store shelves in October and November.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters in the single digits, revenue gains hit 14% and 13% in the past two reports. Earnings also picked up, with jumps of 22% and 39%.

  

The company is expected to report Q3 numbers Nov. 21. Analysts project a 16% profit gain.

  

For the full fiscal year, analysts see EPS growth of 20%, followed by an 11% gain in fiscal 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Foot Locker made IBD's most recent list of New Buys Of Top-Performing Stock Funds For Past Three Months, with 11 top funds picking up $27 million worth of shares.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a year and a half of essentially sideways trading, the stock started moving decisively higher in March.

  

It then formed two shallow consolidations as part of a long base-on-base formation.

  

Weakness in the general market has pulled the stock below its 10-week line, but it's showing signs of resilience. Its Relative Strength line remains near new high ground.

  

With strong fundamentals and signs of institutional support, Foot Locker may be one to watch as we wait for the market to rebound.

As **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) tests the top of a buy zone and **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) tries to refurbish an old one, industry peer **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) constructs a fresh buy point. Hailing from the building and construction products industry, all three stock score high marks in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) for their [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/).




On Sept. 8, [TopBuild announced it is buying Distribution International](https://www.topbuild.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/118/topbuild-to-acquire-distribution-international-in-all-cash) for $1 billion.

TopBuild Delivers Four Quarters Of Accelerating Growth
------------------------------------------------------


The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) has risen sharply off its coronavirus lows as [homebuilder and related stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) also showed strength.


TopBuild has posted four straight quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth. Revenue has gone from a 2% decline in Q2 2020 to a 29% increase in the second quarter of this year. Boosted by demand in the building sector, TopBuild has seen EPS increases ranging from 17% to 64% during the same period.


Analysts see the company delivering a 49% EPS increase for the full year.


On June 25, TopBuild jumped in massive volume on news of [BLD stock joining the S&P 400](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/topbuild-set-to-join-sp-midcap-400-retail-properties-of-america-and-brandywine-realty-trust-to-join-sp-smallcap-600-301083282.html).

----------------------------------------------------------


Builders FirstSource is trading at the top of its [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) as Atkore tries to retake a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) cleared last month. Builders FirstSource and Atkore are both on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of top growth stocks.

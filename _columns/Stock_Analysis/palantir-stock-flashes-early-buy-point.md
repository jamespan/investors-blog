Last month, none of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) — including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — made the list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-broadcom-dethrones-nvidia/). But fellow artificial intelligence leader **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) did. Now as [Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/) reaches a $3 trillion market cap and triumphantly returns to June's list of [new buys by top funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/return-of-the-king-nvidia-back-on-top-in-more-ways-than-one/), [Palantir stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/) is targeting a breakout past a trendline entry.




In May, top-performing money managers scooped up over $366 million worth of shares in [Palantir](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-palantir-technologies-pltr.aspx). Palantir also sports eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Boosted by AI buzz, Palantir delivered [first quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-palantir-earnings-q12024/) that met views while the revenue topped estimates. Sales rose 21% year over year to $634.3 million. Earnings grew 60% to 8 cents a share. Meanwhile, Wall Street forecasts 33% earnings growth to 33 cents a share for the full year.

Palantir Spies Opportunity With Department of Defense, Oracle
-------------------------------------------------------------


Based in Denver, Palantir has its hands in a wide range of industries, including defense, intelligence, energy, autos, data protection, health care, retail, semiconductors and more. Commercial and government clients include the likes of [**Airbus**](https://www.palantir.com/impact/airbus/) ([EADSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EADSY)), [**Ferrari**](https://www.palantir.com/impact/ferrari/) ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) and the United Kingdom's [NHS](https://www.palantir.com/uk/healthcare/). Palantir also offers [MetaConstellation](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/metaconstellation/), harnessing the power of satellite constellations to empower decision-makers back on Earth.


Last month, the U.S. Department of Defense Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office [awarded a contract to Palantir USG](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Palantir-Selected-by-Chief-Digital-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Office-CDAO-to-Participate-in-Scaling-Data-Analytics-and-AI-Capabilities-Across-the-Department-of-Defense-in-Support-of-CJADC2-Strategy/), a Palantir subsidiary. The goal of the production contract is to make licenses of Palantir's AI-enabled operating system available throughout the Pentagon.


In April, Palantir and software giant **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) joined forces to deliver [mission-critical AI solutions](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Oracle-and-Palantir-Join-Forces-to-Deliver-Mission-Critical-AI-Solutions-to-Governments-and-Businesses/) to governments and businesses. The partnership combines Oracle's distributed cloud and AI infrastructure with Palantir's leading AI and decision acceleration platforms. Further, Palantir and Oracle aim to help organizations increase efficiency, address sovereignty requirements and help clients outpace adversaries.


Palantir Stock Eyes Early Breakout
----------------------------------


While continuing to work on a third-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-screener-stocks-to-buy-watch-now/) with a 27.50 buy point, Palantir stock is now teasing an earlier [trendline entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/).


The entry is based on drawing a downward-sloping line from a 27.50 peak across the 25.36 point Palantir hit after reporting earnings on May 6. The early entry would emerge if shares of Palantir can move past that trendline around 24.


Palantir showed rebounding strength Wednesday by jumping back above its 50-day moving average. After jumping again Thursday, the AI stock is down early Friday. Shares of PLTR currently stand at 23.20, within striking distance of the trendline entry.


Oracle also retook its 50-day line on Wednesday as it continues to craft a new base. Gaining 2% Friday, ORCL stock grew its winning streak to a sixth straight up day.


Nvidia established a new all-time high, closing Wednesday's session at the very top of the day's price range in above-average and rising volume. While easing back the last two days, [Nvidia has slightly surpassed](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in terms of market capitalization. Both Nvidia and Apple continue to tease the $3 trillion mark, with Nvidia ($3.02 trillion) taking a slight edge of Apple ($3.01 trillion). **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) stands alone above that benchmark with a market cap of $3.15 trillion.

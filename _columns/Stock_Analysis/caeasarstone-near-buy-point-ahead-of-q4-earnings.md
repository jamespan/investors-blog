As **Caesarstone** ([CSTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTE)) gets ready to report Q4 earnings on Feb. 11, the stock is working on a flat base that could become the foundation for a new price move.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

The Israeli maker of high-quality quartz countertops has posted sales growth ranging from 22% to 31% over the past five quarters. And after a recent EPS slowdown, earnings growth accelerated from 9% to 62% in Q3.

  

Caesarstone's 26% return on equity and EPS growth rate help earn it a Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible. The high return on equity and EPS growth rate attract institutional investors, as shown in the stock's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up-down volume ratio and rise in fund ownership last quarter from 158 to 174 funds.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Six months after [going public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in 2012, Caesarstone started a rise that took its share price from around 14 to more than 60 in just 18 months. It then entered a long and deep consolidation beginning last March.

  

In the right side of that base, the stock closed at the top of the price range for four consecutive weeks in strong volume, a sign of institutional buying. Although the subsequent breakout in November failed to gain traction, there have been continued signs of accumulation in the new consolidation, including several weeks of tight closes along the 10-week line.

  

Caesarstone tried to break past a 64.02 buy point on Tuesday but closed just below the entry. It tried to break out again the next day but reversed to close at the very bottom of the price range. While such a reversal is not ideal, it came the same day that the indexes sold off sharply, and Caesarstone's Relative Strength line remained in new-high ground.

  

The stock bounced back with a 1.8% gain on Thursday.

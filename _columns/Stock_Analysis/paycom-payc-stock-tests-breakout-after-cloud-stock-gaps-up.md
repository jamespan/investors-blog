After declining 36% within its current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), cloud-based human resources leader **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) is back near a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Paycom stock is making some noise, jumping over 16% on the week ended Aug. 6 after posting a second quarter of accelerating earnings and sales growth.




Last month, [Paycom made a deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder](https://investors.paycom.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Thunder-Paycom-Announce-15-Year-Arena-Naming-Rights-Agreement/default.aspx#.YR1L34hKhPY) for naming rights to the NBA team's downtown arena, now named Paycom Center.


Paycom is based in Oklahoma City, Okla., home to thousands of Paycom employees.


In addition to Thunder games, Paycom Center will host numerous concerts, sporting events and other world-class attractions. The venue opened in 2002, and Paycom foresees it welcoming more than 1 million guests per year.


Paycom Stock Joins Long-Term Leaders Watchlist
----------------------------------------------


As a leading [cloud service provider](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/), Paycom provides businesses of all sizes with the tools to handle all aspects of the HR process. Paycom streamlines hiring employees and tracking their performance, as well as managing payroll, lifting staff morale and enhancing engagement.


With an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/) and a track record of stable earnings growth, Paycom has earned a spot on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) watchlist.


The SMR Rating tracks the key ingredients that ultimately drive sustainable earnings growth: sales, profit margins and return on equity.


Over the last three years, Paycom has generated average annual sales growth of 22%. Revenue jumped 33% in Q2, up from 12% in the first quarter. Showing the company is efficiently run, Paycom sports a 33% pretax profit margin and a 34% ROE. Its debt-to-equity ratio is just 4.4%, earning PAYC stock high marks in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Following some tougher quarters in 2020, Paycom had two quarters of accelerating earnings growth, including a 56% spike in its latest report. Analysts expect the company to deliver 26% EPS growth for the full year and a 28% increase in 2022.


Indicating strong institutional demand, Paycom stock sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and an impressive 2.0 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/). Plus, 195 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in PAYC stock.


PAYC Stock Tests Buy Zone After Big Gap-Up
------------------------------------------


While still building its current second-stage [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), Paycom stock gapped up over 10% Aug. 4 after the company reported another quarter of accelerating growth.


After briefly clearing its 471.18 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), PAYC stock has been testing that entry. The stock has shown strength by holding the bulk of the gains it made after [gapping up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on earnings.


While the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) sank significantly as Paycom formed its deep base, the RS line has come well off its lows. Look for that to continue to keep showing renewed market strength.


Paycom stock dipped Thursday in rising but below average volume. The stock rose nearly 3% Friday to close just shy of the earlier buy point. Volume was well below average.

While **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) may sound like a rival of **Tesla Motors'** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) founder Elon Musk's **SolarCity** ([SCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCTY)) , it actually develops software to help IT departments manage their networks more simply and efficiently.


The explosive growth of cloud-based apps and mobile devices has driven demand for its products, and [SolarWinds recently said that it will buy Librato](http://news.investors.com/013015-737113-solarwinds-acquires-librato-earnings-top-consensus-estimates.htm), which provides services to monitor Web apps running on Amazon Web Services.


**Key Fundamentals**


The company beat Q4 earnings and sales estimates, with EPS growth accelerating for the third straight quarter. For 2015, analysts expect earnings to rise 10%, followed by an 18% gain next year.


SolarWinds has a solid 26% return on equity. Its 96 Composite Rating is tops within the Internet-Network Solutions industry group.


**Chart Analysis**


After peaking in March 2013, SolarWinds sold off sharply. It struggled to regain its footing until finally jumping on strong Q3 2014 earnings the week ended Oct. 31. Volume was 207% higher than normal, followed by additional up weeks in above-average trading.


When the general market came under pressure last December, SolarWinds also pulled back. It fell below its 10-week line and spent several weeks trading under that key benchmark. The stock flashed signs of support during the week that ended Feb. 6, when it fell but reversed to close at the top of the price range and right around the 10-week line.


SolarWinds is working on a flat base that is part of a first-stage base-on-base formation. The buy point is 53.54, 10 cents above the peak on the left. See if SolarWinds can punch through that price on volume at least 40% higher than normal.

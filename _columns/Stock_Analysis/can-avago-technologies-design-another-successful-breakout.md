Today we'll look at **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), a Singapore-based company with joint headquarters in San Jose, California.

  

It's a leading designer and developer of analog semiconductors, focusing on three target markets: wireless communications, wired infrastructure, and industrial.

  

Avago's products are used in cell phones, data networking, factory automation, power generation and other industries.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After several quarters of earnings growth below the 25% minimum that you prefer to see, the company showed a nice jump from 16% to 29% in the first quarter. That marked the third straight quarter of acceleration.

  

Revenue growth has also been accelerating, reaching double-digit gains of 19% and 23% in the last two reports.

  

The number of funds reporting ownership in the stock has continued to increase. And one typically better-performing fund has reported a position in Avago: Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).

  

The Up/Down Volume Ratio is 1.1, indicating demand.

  

And its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

  

The company's return on equity is a strong 28%, helping it earn an A SMR Rating.

  

**Weekly Chart**

  

On the MarketSmith weekly chart on this page, you can see that Avago has been climbing since it broke out of cup-shaped base back in September of last year.

  

The stock was unable to rise at least 20% before forming another consolidation, making both of the bases count as one, first-stage base on base pattern.

  

The stock broke out and continued its ascent. It then pulled back to its 10-week line in April.

  

As you can see, volume on that pullback was above average and rising â€” the opposite of what you'd prefer to happen.

  

However, after closing below the 10-week line, Avago bounced back and found support at that benchmark.

  

The stock is currently working on a second-stage flat base with an ideal buy point of 65.93, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

Watch to see if the market can rebound into a new uptrend and Avago can break past the 65.93 buy point on heavy volume. Also keep in mind that the company is scheduled to report earnings on May 19.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-avago-technologies-ltd-avgo.aspx) shows Avago's 99 Composite Rating is the best in its Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 15 among IBD's 197 industries.

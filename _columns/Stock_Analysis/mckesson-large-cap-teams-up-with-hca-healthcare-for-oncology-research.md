McKesson Teams Up With HCA Healthcare For Cancer Research
---------------------------------------------------------


Based in Irving, Texas, McKesson is a health care services leader involved providing pharmaceutical distribution and medical and surgical supplies. It also provides specialty practice solutions for medical product manufacturers and health care providers. In addition to the U.S., [McKesson](https://www.mckesson.com/About-McKesson/Our-Businesses/) has operations in [Canada](https://www.mckesson.ca/) and [Europe](https://www.mckesson.eu/mck-en/).


Earlier this month, [McKesson and HCA Healthcare](https://investor.mckesson.com/news/financial-news/2022/McKesson-and-HCA-Healthcare-Announce-Plans-to-Form-an-Oncology-Research-Joint-Venture-to-Advance-Cancer-Care-and-Increase-Access-to-Oncology-Clinical-Research/default.aspx) announced the two companies are partnering on oncology research. The joint venture combines McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research (USOR) and HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI).


Together, USOR and SCRI will create an integrated oncology research organization aimed at expanding clinical research, and accelerating drug development. The joint venture will also increase access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those in underserved communities.


McKesson and HCA Healthcare expect the transaction to close this year.


McKesson Researches Buy Point With Leading Relative Strength
------------------------------------------------------------


While fellow drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen hits resistance at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/), McKesson has climbed above that benchmark line and has held support in a challenging market. The stock is eyeing a 340.04 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/understanding-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


To close the week, McKesson found support at its 50-day line, ending 3% below the entry.


McKesson's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has already hit a new 52-week high. Unlike most stocks in the [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/), McKesson's 10-week line has continued trending higher despite this year's [market volatility](https://www.investors.com/tag/volatility/).


AmerisourceBergen's 10-week line has also shown resilience this year as the medical sector fares better than the broad market. But since April, ABC stock has seen its 10-week line turn from a [floor of support into a ceiling of resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-2/).


As AmerisourceBergen struggles, McKesson outpaces its rival in terms of [technical strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/).


But when the [market indexes are under pressure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-in-stocks-stock-investing-with-three-step-routine/), as they are now, no stock is immune. See if the market shakes off signs of trouble and continues to strengthen its nascent uptrend. And see if McKesson can build on its market-leading strength and break out to an all-time high.

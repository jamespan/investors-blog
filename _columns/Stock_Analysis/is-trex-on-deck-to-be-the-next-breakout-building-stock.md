Having invented the composite deck category, **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) bills itself as the world's No. 1 decking brand and largest manufacturer of wood-alternative decking products.


But what the [IBD 50 stock](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is building right now may be flooring for a new breakout.


No. 1 Stock In Industry
-----------------------


The Virginia-based company's 94 Composite Rating earns it the top ranking within the Building–Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group.


**Apogee Enterprises** ([APOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOG)), **Headwaters** ([HW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HW)), **Chase** ([CCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCF)) and **Control Materials** ([CUO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUO)) round out the top five.


With its decking and railing products carried in more than 6,700 retail locations worldwide, including **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), Trex generates over $400 million in annual revenue.


It also generates impressive profits, with 50% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, including a 73% spike in Q3.


While Q4 numbers, which are due around Feb. 21, may show slowing gains, Trex still made IBD's list of [top-rated stocks expecting 50% or higher Q4 earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/news/q4-earnings-preview-stocks-expecting-50-or-higher-growth-nvidia-morgan-stanley). Analysts are looking for a 58% rise.


Trex's three-year annual sales growth has been more tepid at 14%. But boosted by an 18.6% annual pretax profit margin and 46% return on equity, the company earns an [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of A.


Volatile Support
----------------


Although Trex rose as much as 42% from an August breakout through November, it hasn't been an easy stock to hold.


It formed a double bottom starting in September, with a sharp sell-off in the second leg of that pattern.



But note how the bottom of that base formed right around the 50.72 buy point in an earlier cup-with-handle. The bottom of Trex's current flat base is also just above a former area of resistance and the entry in the prior double bottom.


So although the stock has been volatile, the way it's been finding support above prior buy points is a positive sign that could mean Trex is building steppingstones for a continued climb.


On Tuesday, the stock found support above its 10-week line to rise over 2%. See if it can go on to clear the 72.31 entry in its current base-on-base formation in heavy volume.

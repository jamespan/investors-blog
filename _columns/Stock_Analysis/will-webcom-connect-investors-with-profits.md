Today we're going to revisit **Web.com** ([WWWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWWW)), which we profiled in March of last year.

  

The firm offers web site registration, Web design and hosting services for companies. In addition, they also offer tools for online and social media marketing, search engine optimization, lead generation and other e-commerce services.

  

As a Jan. 22 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/012114-687029-webcom-does-more-small-business-website-registrations.htm) noted, they typically target firms with 15 or fewer employees and many of their clients are "nonemployer" businesses, where a single person runs the whole show.

  

Most of their clients want to focus on running their companies, rather than hassling with setting up a web site, marketing online or fussing over a social media platform. And that's where Web.com comes in.

  

Most of the firm's revenue comes from selling subscription-based Web solutions. They have more than 3 million customers and added 32,000 just in the third quarter.

  

They get those customers through an aggressive, multipronged marketing strategy that combines everything from knocking on doors to sponsoring a pro golf tour.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Earnings were up 34% year-over-year in each of the past two quarters. 

  

• The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results Feb. 6, so keep an eye out for that report. Analysts are expecting quarterly earnings to rise 26%. 

  

• For the full 2013 year, they estimate earnings climbed 33%. And they expect an 18% increase in 2014. 

  

****Stock Checkup**** 

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-webcom-group-inc-wwww.aspx) shows Web.com carries a 96 Composite Rating, the best in its Internet-Network Solutions industry group.

  

That group is ranked No. 86 among IBD's 197 groups, so it hasn't been one of the market's leaders.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

We last profiled Web.com in the New America Analysis on March 19, when it was forming a cup-with-handle base. It later broke out of that pattern and scored some nice gains.

  

Recently it took a break and carved another cup-with-handle base.

  

To find the 32.58 ideal buy point in a cup-with-handle, just add 10 cents to the peak in the handle.

  

Web.com ventured past that buy point a few times in recent weeks.

  

But volume was below average on each of those breakout attempts.

  

As of early Tues. a.m., it's trading back below that buy point on once again. So watch to see if it can find its footing and resume its climb.

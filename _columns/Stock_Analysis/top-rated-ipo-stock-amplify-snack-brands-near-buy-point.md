Millions of Americans want to eat healthier, but still enjoy a tasty snack. 2015 IPO stock **Amplify Snack Brands** ([BETR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BETR)) is helping them do both.


Based in Austin, TX, Amplify offers two core brands of so-called "better-for-you" snacks: SkinnyPop Popcorn and Paqui Tortilla Chips, which had its national launch in January.


Both products tap into growing demand among consumers – and retailers – for non-GMO, gluten-free foods, allowing Amplify to get its products into mass market outlets like **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and 7-Eleven.


No. 1 Ranking Within Packaged Foods Group
-----------------------------------------


Boosted by a three-year sales growth rate of 120% and an annual pre-tax profit margin of 29.3%, Amplify Snack Brands earns the No. 1 spot among its peers in the packaged foods industry group, ahead of **Bridgford Foods** ([BRID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRID)) and **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)).


After a string of quarters with negative earnings growth, Amplify's earnings-per-share soared 100% in Q4. For 2016, analysts expect EPS to rise 336%, followed by a 30% gain in 2017. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.


The stock's A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 2.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio and rising fund ownership point to strong demand for the stock. Plus, one typically better-performing fund, American Century All Cap Growth (TWGTX), has reported a position in Amplify.


The company's fundamental and technical strength has also earned it a spot on IBD's [IPO Leaders list](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), along with **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) and **Rubicon Project** ([RUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUBI)).


Setting Up In IPO Base
----------------------


Like several other 2015 IPO stocks, including **Blue Buffalo Pet Products** ([BUFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUFF)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), Amplify Snack Brands sold off right after going public in August.

Big spikes in volume on up weeks also point to institutional accumulation.


Another encouraging sign is the upward-trending Relative Strength line, which is approaching new high ground ahead of a possible breakout.


See if Amplify can clear the 17.30 buy point on volume at least 40% above average.

Tracing its roots back to 1785, specialty chemicals maker **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) has traversed the time of the horse and buggy into the modern era of electric vehicles, 5G, AI and smartphones.




Starting its journey 236 years ago with the founding of W. Canning & Co. in Birmingham, England, Element Solutions today has over 4,000 employees operating in more than 50 countries. In 2020, Element Solutions generated $1.85 billion in net sales.


Now based in Florida, the company's key markets include Automotive, Mobile & Wearables, Computing & Telecom, Energy & Resources, Military, Aerospace & Medical and Consumer Goods.


Through its ESI Automotive unit, Element Solutions helps [increase the range of EVs](https://esiauto.com/news/introducing-new-electric-vehicles-0), further expand autonomous driving, and [bolster display screen functionality](https://esiauto.com/news/introduction-displays-and-mold-electronics).


Element Solutions Cooks Up 163% Earnings Growth
-----------------------------------------------


Recent selling pressure in the stock market indexes has also put pressure on ESI stock. Element Solutions has seen its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) slip to a still-strong 94, putting it just shy of a passing score in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).  It ranks No. 2 among its peers in the specialty chemicals industry group.


Over the past three years, the company has generated average annual EPS growth of 163%. That includes two quarters of declining EPS growth in Q2 and Q3 of 2020, followed by a 41% increase in Q4. That earnings beat topped analyst expectations by 10.7%.


Analysts expect Element Solutions to deliver 24% growth in Q1 and a 23% EPS increase for the full year.


Indicating strong [institutional demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), ESI stock sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 46 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in Element Solutions.


EVs, 5G, AI Drive ESI Stock Toward New Buy Point
------------------------------------------------


As the [market for EVs](https://www.investors.com/news/ev-stocks-explosion-may-produce-next-tesla-stock-nio-stock/), 5G, AI and smartphones continues to grow, ESI stock is concocting a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) — a 19.50 entry in a [cup-shape chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). The stock is on day four of a potential handle, which takes at least five days to form.


Indicating rebounding stock market leadership, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is trying to move toward a new 52-week high.


With the [stock market in a correction](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/), now is not the time to make new purchases.


But as the market tries to rebound Friday, ESI stock has also bounced back to retake its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). See if the market and Element Solutions can work through the current turbulence to set up new buying opportunities.

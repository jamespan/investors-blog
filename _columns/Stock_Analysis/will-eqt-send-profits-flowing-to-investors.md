Today we'll look at **EQT Corporation**  ([EQT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQT)), an integrated natural gas and oil company with a majority of its production coming out of Ohio’s Appalachian Basin. 

  

The company operates in three segments: “Upstream,” which handles the company’s exploration and production; “Midstream,” where the oil or gas is transported, stored, processed and marketed; and “downstream,” where oil or gas is refined and purified.   
**Chart Analysis** 

  

After several quarters of negative earnings growth in 2012, EQT’s numbers have bounced back, including a jump from 24% to 214% in the latest report.  


  

Sales growth has also displayed strength, accelerating from 21% to 59% last quarter.  


  

The company is scheduled to report Q2 numbers on July 24.  


  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 102%, followed by a 15% gain in 2015.   


  

The Accumulation/Distribution rating of B+ shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks. And the solid Up/Down Volume Ratio of 1.9, indicates demand for the stock.  


  

The number of funds that own EQT rose last quarter. And  two typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the stock: Invesco Mid Cap Growth A (VGRAX) Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX)

  

**Weekly Chart**

  

As you can see on this weekly chart, the stock formed a five-week flat base back last year, and broke out in September. It climbed than 10% before hitting resistance and pulling back to form another flat base. 

  

EQT fell below its 10-week line, but found support at its 40-week moving average. Note how how that low undercut the low in the prior flat base. That resets the base count, making this a first-stage pattern.  


  

Also, that trip to the 40 week line was actually a bullish reversal that showed support.  After trading lower during the week, the stock bounced back to close above the 10-week line and at the top of its price range. A volume was above average on that move.    


  

EQT broke out in February, and edged higher until hitting resistance in May. The gain from the prior buy point was less than 20%, so the current flat base is considered part of a first-stage base-on-base pattern.  


  

The current formation is a flat base with an ideal buy point of 111.57, 10 cents above the peak on the left. 

  

Watch to see if EQT it can climb above that price on volume at least 40% to 50% higher than normal.

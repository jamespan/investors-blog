This month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/amazon-stock-palantir-oracle-and-this-auctioneer-lead-list-of-new-buys-by-the-best-mutual-funds/) once again shows that the artificial intelligence boom is not over. Top money managers placed massive bets on [AI stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-news/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)).




Driving that demand, Amazon delivered 236% earnings growth in the third quarter, while Palantir's 600% EPS growth continues to propel [PLTR stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/) to a fresh breakout and beyond. Building on Friday's 3.6% jump, Palantir has added another 4.5% heading into the close.


Leading money managers invested an eye-popping [$16.2 billion in Amazon stock](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/amazon-stock-top-funds-invest-10-times-as-much-in-amazon-as-in-nvidia-stock/) in this month's report — 10 times what they poured into fellow AI powerhouse **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) in October. But the best mutual funds also scooped up $652 million worth of shares in [PLTR stock](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/new-highs-ai-leader-palantir-and-dow-jones-giant-visa-hit-buy-points/).


Since the end of last year, Palantir has generated a string of quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. For 2023, Wall Street forecasts a 312% EPS spike.


Sales growth remains solidly in double digits, ranging from 13% to 17% over the last four quarters. In Q3, Palantir generated $558.2 million in revenue, a 17% gain over the prior-year quarter.


Further showcasing institutional demand, PLTR stock commands an A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and a strong 1.9 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/). Overall, Palantir earns a 98 [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-palantir-technologies-pltr.aspx).

PLTR Stock Rides AI Boom Into Buy Zone And Beyond
-------------------------------------------------


Since its 2020 [IPO](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), Palantir has seen its share of vicious volatility. But PLTR stock established a bottom at the end of last year and has just launched a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


The latest formation is a second-stage [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#cupwithhandle) offering a 20.24 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). On Wednesday, PLTR briefly hit that entry before edging lower. But on Friday, Palantir stock gained over 3%, pushing into buy range. Once again, volume was above average.


Continuing to build steam, PLTR stock soared again Monday, soaring into a beyond a new buy zone.


Showing market leadership, its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) has already hit a new high to earn a [blue dot in MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-use-these-marketsmith-features-to-catch-stock-market-leaders/).


Confirming Palantir's technical strength, the stock trades well above its [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and 200-day moving averages.

California-based **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) got a boost last week when a new study showed that patients undergoing procedures with its da Vinci Surgical Systems experienced fewer complications than subjects undergoing conventional operations.


That was welcome news for the leader in robotic-assisted surgery, helping settle the long-running debate about the merits of the minimally-invasive -- but quite expensive -- da Vinci equipment compared to traditional surgery.


But success, plus plenty of room for growth, attracts competition, and Intuitive Surgical is facing an expanding lineup of rivals, including **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)), **TransEntrix** ([TRXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRXC)), Titan Medical and **Mazor Robotics** ([MZOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MZOR)).


In 2014, robotic-assisted surgeries made up only about 10% of total operations in the U.S. and European Union. WinterGreen Research has projected the market to grow from $3.2 billion in 2014 to $20 billion by 2021.


To get a piece of that growing pie, Google Life Sciences -- now Alphabet’s Verily division -- teamed up last year with **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) to launch [Verb Surgical](http://www.verbsurgical.com/), which will focus on advanced surgical robotics.


Medtronic also jumped into the business last year with its purchase of surgical giant Covidien.


Smaller rivals TransEntrix, Titan and Mazor are aiming to take market share from Intuitive Surgical by offering robotic systems at a much lower cost, which could put pressure on Intuitive’s 40.4% annual pre-tax profit margin.


**Intuitive Surgical Nears Potential Breakout**

Since posting another failed breakout in January, Intuitive Surgical has been working on its current base as part of a longer formation.


The buy point is 580.10, 10 cents above the peak on the left. Weekly volume has been rising as the stock nears a potential breakout.

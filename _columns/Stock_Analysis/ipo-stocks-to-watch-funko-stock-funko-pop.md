As one of best [IPO stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)) may be getting a new boost from its popular lineup of Funko Pop! toys. After an initial 237% run, Funko stock is now testing a new buy zone. But selling pressure in the overall market and earnings set for Aug. 8 call for caution.




Based in Everett, Wash., Funko sells pop culture and collectible items, holding hundreds of licenses for creating thousands of characters.


In addition to its wide range of Funko Pop! toys and other products, the company recently introduced Funkoverse, a strategy board game featuring licensed characters such as Batman, Harry Potter and Rick and Morty.

Explosive Earnings Puts Funko Among Top IPO Stocks To Watch
-----------------------------------------------------------


Founded in 1998 with its IPO in November 2017, the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock has been posting serious profits over the last four quarters. The company has delivered earnings growth ranging from 108% to 433% during that time. Funko has generated revenue gains of 22% to 38% over the same period.


The company is on tap to report Q2 earnings after the close Thursday. Analysts expect EPS to rise 85% for the quarter, and 41% for the full year.


With a 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Funko stock leads the three-member toys, games and hobbies industry group, which ranks No. 32 among the 197 groups IBD tracks. **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) comes in second with a 92 rating, followed by **Mattel** ([MAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAT)) with a more lowly 64.


Funko has seen institutional demand for shares, as indicated by a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/), a 1.3 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/), and five quarters of rising fund ownership.


Funko Stock Toying With New Buy Zone; Is Funko Pop Coming?
----------------------------------------------------------


After breaking out from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/) in May 2018, Funko stock bolted higher, rising as much as 237% before making a sharp reversal in September. The retreat came as a [bear market](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/) hit.


The stock has since recovered from that steep decline. It formed a choppy base, and eventually managed to clear a new 24.40 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But in a sign of continued volatility, Funko fell back below that entry in heavy volume over the next several days.


Although Funko managed to find support at its 50-day line and retake that same buy zone in late July, the stock is once again running into turbulence on a new [Donald Trump tariff on Chinese imports](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-gain-shrinks-on-new-trump-tariff-this-solar-stock-hits-sell-signal/). Funko pulled back with the rest of the market Friday, falling over 7%. But it closed the session right at the benchmark 50-day line.


So while Funko has posted triple-digit earnings and is trying to show resilience, keep a close eye on the [U.S.-China trade war](https://www.investors.com/news/apple-stock-falls-trump-tariffs-retail-stocks/), as well as Funko's upcoming earnings report.

Just as **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has lured — and successfully locked — customers into its ecosphere with Amazon Prime benefits, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is leveraging its massive scale to take a deeper dive into e-commerce.


Earlier this month, the social media giant [launched Marketplace](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/facebook-flexes-e-commerce-muscle-with-food-tickets-quotes/), a platform that facilitates the buying and selling of local goods.


Now Facebook users can also order food, buy movie tickets, make spa reservations and conduct other transactions — all without ever leaving Facebook.


While that's convenient for users, it may spell trouble for **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) and fellow IBD 50 member **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)).


[Ebay cratered nearly 11%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ebay-gets-picked-apart-as-q3-earnings-miss-some-key-metrics/) on Thursday after reporting earnings, with analysts seeing increasing competition from Amazon and Facebook.


But investors haven't taken a bite out of GrubHub. Instead, the stock has moved higher in recent days in heavy volume as it bounced off its 50-day moving average.


Q3 Earnings Ahead
-----------------


Facebook sports solid three-year annual growth rates for earnings (64%) and sales (52%), and is expected to post another strong quarter when it releases Q3 numbers on Nov. 2.


Like Amazon and fellow internet stock **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)), Facebook made IBD's recent list of [top-rated companies expected to post 50%-plus growth in Q3](https://www.investors.com/news/q3-earnings-preview-which-stocks-expect-50-or-higher-growth-2/).


Testing Buy Point … Again
-------------------------


Eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership and a 1.5 up/down volume ratio point to [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) for Facebook, but the stock has struggled to break out decisively from recent setups.


Facebook is currently trading just above a prior 128.43 entry, and may be setting up a new base with a 132.08 buy point.



While selling pressure has the Nasdaq testing support at the 50-line, Facebook's relative strength line has climbed back into new high ground, meaning it may be ready to move if a stronger market uptrend emerges.


In this environment — and with Facebook set to report earnings soon — investors should proceed with caution.

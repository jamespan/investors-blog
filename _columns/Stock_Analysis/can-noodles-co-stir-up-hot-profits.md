Today we're going to look at **Noodles & Co.** ([NDLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NDLS)), which is a restaurant chain that's been whetting investors' appetites. They were featured in the Sept. 23 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/092013-671906-noodles-and-company-restaurant-growth-strong.htm).

  

Their restaurants cook noodle dishes to order, serving everything from Tuscan linguini to pad thai rice to mac 'n cheese. They also have soups, salads and sandwiches.

  

The average price of an entree is $8. And as of July, they had 295 restaurants and 53 franchises in 26 states and the District of Columbia.

  

Analysts say that fast-casual is the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry, with sales up 10% last year, which is better than the 4% growth logged by the industry has a whole.

  

Experts say Noodles can open shops in places others cannot. That's because even with lower volume they get the same profitability. Each of their restaurants averages about $1 million in sales and roughly 20% profitability. They are also helped by the fact that pasta carries a high profit margin.

  

Most of their restaurants are developed in shopping centers in leased locations, which reduces the amount of cash required to open new stores, compared to heavier cash outlays of owning the building

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• Sales growth ranged from 16% to 21% the past five quarters.

  

• Earnings growth slowed in the first quarter, but rose 30% last quarter.

  

• The firm is slated to release third-quarter earnings Oct. 29, analyst are expecting 11 cents a share, which would be a 266% increase over the same quarter last year.

  

• For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 82% in 2013 and 38% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-noodles-and-company-cl-a-ndls.aspx) shows the stock's 53 Composite Rating is ranked No. 34 among the 54 stocks in its Retail-Restaurants industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 60 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock came public in late June at 18 a share and quickly jumped to nearly 52 a share.

  

But it's not a good idea to buy a stock in the early days immediately following its IPO. A better strategy is to wait for it to settle down and form its first base pattern.

  

Noodles went on to form a consolidation and has been hitting resistance around 49 a share. So it may be worth keeping an eye on to see if it can break out of that pattern and launch a new climb.

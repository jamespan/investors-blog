Health care and hospital stocks like **Community Health System** ([CYH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYH)), **HCA Holdings** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)) and **Team Health Holdings** ([TMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMH)) got a boost from Thursday's Supreme Court decision upholding federal ObamaCare subsidies.

  

Other medical-sector stocks have also been showing strength. One is **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), which develops products to treat advanced cardiovascular disorders.

  

On June 17, investors pumped up the stock on news that [Edwards received FDA approval](http://news.investors.com/investing-ibd-industry-themes/062415-758814-edwards-lifesciences-shines-in-heart-valve-market.htm) for a thinner version of its Sapien 3 artificial heart valve, which can be inserted without open-heart surgery.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

While sales growth edged lower to 13% in Q1, earnings growth spiked to 47%, up from 12% in Q4. For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 22%, followed by a 10% gain in 2016.

  

Edwards Lifesciences has a solid 20% return on equity and a 97 Composite Rating.

  

Signs of institutional demand include its 1.7 up/down volume ratio and a nice rise in fund ownership in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

From the beginning of 2014 through March of this year, Edwards stock rose well over 100%. It then took a breather and [reset its base count](http://ibdtv.investors.com/656846-getting-started-counting-bases.aspx) when the low in its new pattern undercut the low in the prior consolidation.

  

The stock found support at the 40-week line and flashed several weeks of tight closes as it built the right side of the base.

  

Last week, Edwards Lifesciences bolted higher on news of the FDA approval. Volume for the week was 58% higher than normal, a sign of institutional buying.

  

That move also pushed the relative strength line closer to new high ground.

  

The stock is now forming a handle, giving it a 147.40 buy point.

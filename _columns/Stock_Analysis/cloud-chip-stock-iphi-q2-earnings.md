It's no secret that tech titans like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are driving demand for high-speed cloud computing and always-connected, Internet of Things (IoT) devices.


But which behind-the-scenes companies are benefiting from that demand?


One is Silicon Valley-based **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), which designs high-speed, mixed-signal semiconductor solutions for the communications, data center and computing industries. Inphi's products are designed to "move big data fast" within the long haul, metro and enterprise/cloud markets.


The 2010 IPO ranks No. 2 within the fabless chip designers industry group, just behind **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), which was featured in the [July 29 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/will-broadcom-get-caught-barefoot-as-stock-tries-to-break-out/). **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)), **Maxlinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) round out the top five.


A Coming 'Super Cycle'?
-----------------------


As IBD reported earlier, Needham analyst Alex Henderson cited several factors that could create a [new super cycle for optical networking](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/optical-networking-stocks-break-out-on-report-of-coming-super-cycle/), including growing demand in China and the transition to 5G (fifth generation) wireless networks.


Henderson noted that Inphi, **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)), **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)), **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) and **NeoPhotonics** ([NPTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NPTN)) stand to benefit from those trends.


But theÂ chip industry is a cyclical one, and Inphi has seen its earnings growth slow from at least six straight quarters of triple-digit gains to 13% and 17% increases in Q4 and Q1, respectively. Sales growth has also slowed significantly, coming in at 12% in the latest report.


The company is set to release Q2 numbers on Aug. 8.


Later-Stage Breakout Attempt
----------------------------


Inphi's stock has been trending generally higher since the end of 2012, forming several bases along the way.


After breaking out of a later-stage double bottom in mid-July and rising as much as 8%, the stock began to retreat. It's now trading back within the 33.69-35.37 buy zone.


Keep in mind that later-stage breakouts are more prone to failure and it's risky to buy a stock just before it reports. But also note that in this market, many breakouts have stalled or given back profits, only to take off again later.


On Thursday, Inphi found support at the buy point and moved up 1.3% for the day, although volume was below average.


See if Inphi reports well next week and continues to rise in heavy volume.

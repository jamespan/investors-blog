**Phillips 66 Partners** ([PSXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSXP)) is a Houston-based company that owns and operates oil and gas pipelines and terminals.

  

The firm was founded as a subsidiary of **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)), the oil and gas giant and later spun off. It went public July 2013.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Phillips 66 Partners' sales growth has been increasing for several quarters with second-quarter sales growth coming in at 117%.

  

The company has shown double-digit earnings growth, with the growth rate accelerating the last three quarters.

  

For the full year, analysts see earnings rising 81%.

  

The company's the EPS Rating is only 80 out of 99.

  

The C+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows the amount of buying and selling among big investors has been roughly equal in recent weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After its market debut July 2013 the stock broke out of a base in December and kept climbing to new highs until July when it dropped below the 10-week moving average line.

  

This month the stock has been working on the right side of a base as you can see on the MarketSmith chart on this page.

  

It might shape a cup pattern, but it's still early.

  

Phillips 66 Partners is a growth stock that also pays a dividend.

  

But one concern is that it's a thinly traded stock, meaning on average fewer than 400,000 shares are traded daily. That means the stock can be more vulnerable to big price swings.

In December, commercial real estate leader **Walker & Dunlop** ([WD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WD)) closed on its previously announced [acquisition of Alliance Capital](https://www.walkerdunlop.com/news-and-events/2021-12-16-walker-dunlop-acquires-alliant-capital/). Then earlier this month, the Maryland-based company made the [largest entitled land trade](https://investors.walkerdunlop.com/news/news-details/2022/Largest-Entitled-Land-Trade-in-Santa-Monica-CA-History-Completed-by-Walker--Dunlop/default.aspx) in Santa Monica, Calif. history.




Feeling the turbulence in the stock market indexes, Walker & Dunlop is looking for support after falling below its 10-week line. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) remains near a new high, but has slipped lower.


With a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), Walker & Dunlop earns a spot among the top commercial real estate names in its industry group, which ranks No. 13 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Commercial Real Estate Deals Drive Walker & Dunlop Growth
---------------------------------------------------------


Founded in 1937, Walker & Dunlop provides customized financing solutions to owners and operators of commercial real estate properties around the country. Today, it is one of the largest commercial real estate lenders in the U.S., also offeringÂ investment sales services for multifamily properties.


Walker & Dunlop has over 1,000 employees with 38 offices nationwide.


The acquisition of Alliance Capital expands Walker & Dunlop's presence in the affordable housing sector. As an alternative investment manager, Alliance Capital focuses on low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) syndication. It is the sixth largest [LIHTC](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html) syndicator in the U.S. It has participated in the development of over 100,000 affordable units serving over 400,000 families.


Walker & Dunlop Chairman and CEO Willy Walker said in a release that "as housing prices continue to escalate, and inflation eats into American paychecks, the affordable housing crisis exacerbates." He added that "Walker & Dunlop is now a big part of the solution to build and maintain affordable and workforce housing across America."


On Jan. 3, Walker & Dunlop said it has facilitated the sale and financing for The Santa Monica Collection. The eight-site portfolio spans 3.1 acres, making it one of the largest entitled land sales on the West Coast and the largest in Santa Monica history. (Entitled land refers to land with all required government agency permissions for development.)


The Santa Monica portfolio includes 325,391 net rentable square feet. That includes 31,473 square feet of commercial space and 627 multifamily units.


WD Stock Looks For Floor Of Support
-----------------------------------


Walker & Dunlop is set to report Q4 and full year earnings on Feb. 3 before the stock market open.


After a 33% spike in earnings growth in Q3, analysts forecast a 12% slowdown in Q4. For 2021, analysts expect 5% EPS growth. On the revenue front, Walker & Dunlop posted 40% growth last quarter and has averaged annual sales growth of 19% over the last three years.


Although its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) has been trending higher, Walker & Dunlop has fallen below that benchmark. The [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) shows a 156.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) that remains intact, but all the major stock market indexes are also below their 50-day and 200-day lines.


As the general market looks to fight off selling pressure and [return to an uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-in-stocks-start-with-stock-market-investing-routine-routine/), see if the commercial real estate leader can shore up support and repair its base.

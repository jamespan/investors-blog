Today we're going to look at **NextEra Energy Partners** ([NEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEP)), which owns and operates renewable energy projects like wind and solar in North America.

  

The clean energy company, which is based in Juno Beach, Fla., just went public in June.

  

The stock was featured this week in IBD's [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/090314-715857-nextera-energy-partners-clean-energy-projects.htm).

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

NextEra's sales growth has been accelerating the past two quarters reaching the triple digits in the second quarter.

  

The company had an earnings slump in 2013, with a loss in the first quarter of that year.

  

But the firm has since returned to profitability. In the second quarter, earnings were strong with an increase of 190%.

  

Annual earnings declined from 2012 to 2013, but seem to be improving.

  

Analysts expect profits to rise 16% this year and 19% next year.

  

NextEra carries a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating. That tells you large investors have been buying the stock in recent weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After a little more than two months on the market, as of Fri. a.m., the stock was up about 11% from its closing price on the day it made its market debut.

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith chart on this page, in late July, NextEra pulled back to form its first base. The pattern has shaped up to be a flat base with a 37 ideal buy point.

  

The stock is a member of the Energy-Alternative/Other industry group, which is ranked No. 1 among IBD's 197 groups. And NextEra is ranked No. 2 among the 41 stocks in that group.

  

That means it's a leading stock in a leading group, so you might want to keep an eye on it.

**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) is a China-based firm that operates two websites — autohome.com and che168.com — aimed at automobile consumers in that country.

  

The company went public Dec. 2013.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Autohome has been profitable, but earnings growth has been inconsistent, coming in flat in two of the last four quarters. In the second quarter, earnings rose 55%.

  

Revenue has been steadier with double- and triple-digit increases the past several quarters. And second-quarter sales growth accelerated slightly.

  

Autohome scores a 99 Composite Rating, the highest mark possible.

  

The stock's A+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating tells you large investors have been buying shares in recent months.

  

But the number of funds owning the stock has declined in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After coming public at $17 a share in December, Autohome tripled in just a few months.

  

But in March, the stock fell into a deep 45% correction.

  

In late July, it started climbing the right side of that cup-shaped base. The ideal buy point in that pattern is 52.08.

  

However one concern is that the base is deeper than a standard cup-shaped pattern, which reduces the possibility of a successful breakout.

  

As Autohome climbs near the resistance level, watch to see if the stock has enough gas in the tank to drive past the buy point or if it stops to refuel and forms a handle

  

As always the big investors are in the driver's seat.

  

And a stock's trading volume is how you know when their foot is on the pedal. Watch to see if it's at least 40% above average on the day the stock tries to break out.

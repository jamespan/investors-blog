With daily and weekly fluctuations and volatility in the stock market, some long-term winners make remarkable gains under the radar of many investors. Take for instance **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)).




A look at the monthly stock chart shows the name of the company fits the performance of the stock. From its lows in October 2011 to a new all-time high in January of this year, MPWR stock has risen an impressive 4,480%.


The [semiconductor sector](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-companies-semiconductor-industry/) leader — involved in industries including cloud computing, automotive, telecom and consumer and industrial applications — even outperformed fellow chip designers like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). During that nearly 10-year same period, NVDA stock rose 3,684%, while AMD stock gained a "mere" 2,202%.


While not as well-known or heavily covered as Nvidia and AMD stock, leading money managers have certainly been paying attention to Monolithic Power. MPWR stock made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-investing-semiconductor-stocks-cloud-stocks/), Plus, 173 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in the stock.


While often found on that monthly list, NVDA stock and AMD stock did not make the cut in February.


Monolithic Power has slipped to a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), just shy of a passing rating in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). AMD has a 95 rating, while recent selling pressure has pushed Nvidia stock to a 91. MPWR, Nvidia and AMD stock are all on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of leading growth stocks.


Monolithic Power Eyes Accelerating Growth In Q1
-----------------------------------------------


Founded in 1997, Monolithic Power works with the world's largest original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), data centers, automotive suppliers, gaming consoles and other companies to deliver high-performance power solutions. Products include power management integrated circuits and full solutions, power modules, sensors, motor drivers and smart motors.


Using ultracompact modules, it integrates all the necessary components into a single package on the same silicon die, saving board space.


Analysts have recently raised earnings estimates for Monolithic Power for both 2021 and 2022. For Q1 2021, Wall Street watchers see a 41% EPS rise, which would mark a second quarter of accelerating growth.


Like its highly efficient semiconductors, Monolithic Power is a highly efficient company. It sports an A SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. As components of that rating, there was a 30.6% annual pretax profit margin and a 27.2% ROE in 2020.


MPWR, NVDA Stock Test Support
-----------------------------


As the stock market comes under selling pressure, Monolithic Power and Nvidia stock are testing their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). AMD stock has already slipped below that benchmark.


After breaking out at the end of last year, MPWR stock is also now testing a new buying opportunity from a bounce off the 10-week line earlier in February.


Keep an eye out for any changes in [market direction](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-of-the-stock-market/), and see if Monolithic Power, Nvidia and AMD stock can shake off resistance and resume their climbs.


On Friday, Monolithic Power retook its 50-day line in below-average but rising volume. Nvidia also moved above that benchmark. AMD stock also rose, but remains below that key moving average.

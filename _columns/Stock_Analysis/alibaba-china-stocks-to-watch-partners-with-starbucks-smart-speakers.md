As **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) percolates with its smart-speaker partnership with **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and rising earnings estimates, Alibaba stock is among the top China stocks to watch.




The coffee king and e-commerce giant are teaming up to enable [smart speaker ordering and delivery to Chinese customers](https://www.investors.com/news/starbucks-stock-coffee-giant-teams-alibaba-offer-voice-ordering-china/). As IBD reported, "the new service will be offered through Alibaba's Tmall Genie smart speaker. ... One key to the venture's potential success is speed. Starbucks boasted customers will be able to receive both beverages and food within a 30-minute window."


Earnings estimates are also providing encouragement for Alibaba stock as it closes in on a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Analysts expect the company to post a 20% earnings increase for the full year, followed by a 26% gain in 2020. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

Alibaba Stock Among Top China Stocks To Watch
---------------------------------------------


Although its Retail-Internet industry group ranks a lowly No. 159 among the 197 groups IBD tracks, Alibaba is the top-rated stocks among its peers with a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/).


One of the other top China stocks to watch is **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), while **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Mercado Libre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) round out the top five.


Large investors are also showing demand in Alibaba stock. It sports a 1.6 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) (up from 1.4 yesterday), B- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-key-to-investment-success/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


After some recent bouts of heavy-volume selling, Alibaba partner Starbucks has seen its Accumulation/Distribution Rating drop to an E. But the Seattle-based company appears to be finding a bottom, so look for that rating to improve. The number of funds with a position in Starbucks has also risen over the last three quarters.


New Breakout For Alibaba Stock?
-------------------------------


Alibaba has encountered long-term resistance around the 205 mark since January 2018. Time will tell if it can punch through that ceiling in heavy-volume and keep rising.


The stock is currently forming a cup-type base showing a 195.82 entry. On Wednesday, Alibaba stock gave back much of its gains to close slightly higher. On Friday, Alibaba had a bit of a roller coaster day, but wrapped up the session with a 1.1% gain at 182.47.


Starbucks is trading under its 50-day line, about 10% below its 99.82 entry. JD.com fell to about 4% short of its potential 32.48 buy point after posting 560% EPS growth in its most recent quarterly earnings report. But China play closed the day above its 50-day line.

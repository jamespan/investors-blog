As the stock market shows signs of a rebound, **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) keeps plowing ahead toward a potential breakout. Is Tractor Supply stock — ranked No. 1 among building products retailers — now sowing the seeds of a new climb?




With a 91 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Tractor Supply just tops **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), which earns a score of 90. Fellow big box retailer **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) lags its industry peers with a 63 Composite Rating.


Based in Tennessee, Tractor Supply has over 1,700 rural lifestyle stores in 49 states, generating nearly $8 billion in revenue in 2018. By comparison Home Depot has nearly 2,300 locations in all 50 states, with $108.2 billion in sales last fiscal year. Lowe's posted $71.3 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018 across more than 2,200 stores.

Tapping Into The Tractor Supply 'Stockyard'
-------------------------------------------


Founded in 1938 as a mail order catalog for tractor parts, Tractor Supply has, in a way, returned to its roots in recent years with a robust omnichannel sales strategy. In addition to pushing in-store pickup of products ordered online, the company has been driving incremental growth through Stockyard, a platform that lets store associates offer customers out-of-stock items from Tractor Supply vendors.


Although Tractor Supply is not a high-growth company, it does sport an A [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/), which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole. It has a low debt-to-equity ratio of 26% and a strong 35.7% ROE, indicating that it's an efficiently run enterprise.


Steady gains from efficiently used capital appeals to institutional investors, and Tractor Supply stock has seen seven straight quarters of [rising fund ownership](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/). The number of funds with a position in the stock jumped from 1,390 to 1,488 last quarter. The stock also sports a 1.7 up/down volume ratio, which indicates solid demand for shares.

RS Line At New High TSCO Stock Breakout
---------------------------------------


From a bottom hit in July 2008 through a new all-time intraday high hit in April of this year, Tractor Supply stock rose a remarkable 1,517%, making it one of the [best stocks in the bull market](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/bulls-best-stock-turned-1000-78054/) that began in 2009. Within that big run, the stock ran up 117% from a low in July 2017 before pulling back from the all-time high in April.


Tractor Supply has been working on a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) formation. The stock is now just above a 108.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a flat base as part of that long-term pattern. Volume on the breakout was below average, so look for heavier trade to kick in next week.


While forming the current [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/), Tractor Supply briefly slipped below the 50-day moving average, but quickly moved back above that benchmark line. The [relative strength (RS) line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is already at a new 52-week high, a bullish sign at the time of a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/).


The current outlook is still "[market in correction](https://www.investors.com/videos/is-it-time-to-get-into-or-out-or-the-stock-market/)," meaning its best to avoid new buys. But the indexes could soon deliver a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) to launch a new uptrend.

Health savings account leader **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) is among the [companies outperforming 95% of all stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), and may be launching a new breakout run.









 
 
 HealthEquity has a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which means the Utah-based company is outpacing 95% of all stocks in terms of the [most important stock-picking criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins and institutional sponsorship.
Google parent and [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), [leading Chinese internet stock](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) and **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) are also among the companies that recently joined the 95-plus Composite Rating club.


Alphabet has managed to hold on to the gains it made following its strong Q3 earnings report. The stock is trading at the upper end of the buy range from the 1006.29. CarMax, which also jumped on its latest report in September, may be setting up a follow-on buying opportunity.

90% Annual Earnings Growth

HealthEquity beat estimates for its fiscal 2017 Q2 (ended July 31), when it reported a 31% jump in earnings growth. Revenue rose from 26% to 29%.


The company, which provides online platforms for customers to manage their health savings accounts, has been growing EPS at a 90% annual clip over the last three years. Sales have risen at a 41% rate during the same period.


Institutional demand is reflected in a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, 1.5 up/down volume ratio and six quarters of rising fund ownership. HealthEquity is expected to report Q3 numbers in early December, with analysts looking for a 30% gain in earnings.


On Monday, HealthEquity rose over 6% to jump past a 52.97 buy point in a cup with handle.Â Volume was over 200% higher than normal. Keep in mind that the stock has launched two failed breakouts since January.

**Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-microsoft-apple-facebook-google-lead-stocks-to-buy-watch/). It's also on the watchlist for [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). And the world's largest distributor of pool supplies is managing to keep swimming in the volatile coronavirus stock market. Will it dip its toes into a new buy zone?




With a 96 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/companies-now-outperforming-95-of-all-stocks/), Pool is the No. 1 ranked stock leisure product retailers. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) are among 18 stocks currently in the IBD Long-Term Leaders portfolio.


Pool is more of a slow-and-steady distance swimmer than a sprinter. But it did post accelerating earnings (20%) and sales (13%) growth when it reported Q1 numbers on April 23.


One reason Pool stock is in contention to be named a long-term leader is its earnings stability rating of 4. (The lower the number, the more stable the earnings.) Plus, the Louisiana-based company sports a stellar 75% return on equity. That outpaces the ROEs of Microsoft (40%), Alibaba (21%), PayPal (22%) and ServiceNow (40%).


Pool Stock Swims To 1,982% Gain
-------------------------------


To see the remarkable gains for Pool stock over time, check the monthly chart. Since hitting a bottom in March 2009, Pool has been moving steadily upstream, rising from around 11 to 229, a gain of 1,982%.


Such a move puts Pool stock in an elite class of stocks such as Microsoft, which gained around 1,100% during the same period. ServiceNow has risen around 1,500% since its June 2012 IPO.


Strong and rising [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) is a key component of these types of sustained, upward climbs. That's certainly the case for Pool stock, which sports an A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and eight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, 61 funds with an A+ rating from IBD have a position in the stock.


Pool Stock Still Wading Just Below Buy Point
--------------------------------------------


Despite continued volatility in the general market this week, Pool freestyled to more than a 2% gain on Friday, putting it 3% below a 229.98 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/).


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at a new 52-week high, showing that the stock is outperforming the S&P 500.


See if the coronavirus stock market uptrend can continue to show resilience and if Pool stock can hold its ground and break out to a new all-time high.

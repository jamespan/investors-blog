Today we have an interesting comeback story for you. It's about **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) — their shape-toning shoes were all the rage back in 2010 as an [April 24 New America](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/042313-652997-skechers-sells-to-macys-dillards-jc-penney.htm) article noted.

  

Then they fell flat and the FTC charged they didn't do what Skechers claimed they would.

  

And as the company's wholesale customers were clearing out their Shape-up shoe inventory, they were reluctant to place big orders for other Skechers products.

  

Since then they've redeveloped a lot of their product lines and come up with new products like running shoes that have been gaining traction.

  

And lately their products — including dress and casual shoes — have been selling well with wholesalers and also in Skecher's more than 350 company-owned stores.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

• You can see that turn around in Skecher's fundamentals.

  

• After a string of losses and falling sales, both earnings and sales growth have rebounded.

  

• It's set to release first-quarter earnings Fri. with analysts predicting a 371% increase.

  

• For the full-year they see earnings rising 411% in 2013 and 43% in 2014.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Check](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-skechers-u-s-a-inc-cl-a-skx.aspx) up shows Skechers has the fifth highest Composite Rating in the Apparel-Shoes industry group.

  

**Steven Madden** ([SHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOO)) carries the highest overall rating, but its earnings estimate this year isn't as strong as Skechers'is.

  

And the group itself is ranked No. 32 among IBD's 197 groups, so it's been one of the market's better performers.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As the MarketSmith daily chart above shows, Skechers carved out a flat base and tried to break out of it a few times last month.

  

But it couldn't find its footing and later it dropped more than 7% below the ideal buy point — so if you bought in at that level and follow IBD's rules, you would have been forced to sell.

  

The stock had been finding support near the 50-day line, but in recent days has dipped below it.

  

Still it may be worth keeping an eye on to see if it can stage another breakout attempt.

  

And watch how it behaves when the latest earnings results come out Fri. As we've mentioned before, stocks can make big moves when earnings are released.

  

But here's something else to be aware of: the stock took a hit April 25 when it announced a projected first-quarter income that fell short of estimates. So it will be interesting to see what's in the final numbers on Fri.

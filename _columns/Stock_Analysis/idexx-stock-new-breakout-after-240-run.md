After running up 240% off its March 2020 lows, **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) is sniffing at a new breakout with earnings due May 4. IDXX stock already joins fellow medical sector stocks **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Charles River Labs** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) and **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list of top growth stocks.




As a leading provider of [medical products](https://www.investors.com/tag/medical-products/) for the veterinary market, Idexx has been good to pets and livestock, and IDXX stock has been good to investors.


Over the last three years, the provider of animal diagnostic products and services has delivered average annual earnings growth of 24%, including a 43% gain last quarter. Analysts expect Idexx to post a 33% gain for the first quarter.


Like Veeva, Thermo Fisher, Charles River Labs and other IBD Long-Term Leaders, Idexx stock has a strong three-year EPS stability rating. Unlike the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), where the higher the score the better, the lower the EPS stability rating the better. Idexx's rating of three shows it has a strong track record of consistent earnings.


With a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), IDXX stock ranks No. 2 in its industry group, just behind **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)). InMode is on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).


Idexx Has Top Money Managers Wagging Their Tails
------------------------------------------------


Attracted by its success and stability, 153 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-building-positions-growth-stock/) with an A+ rating from IBD own shares in IDXX stock, including T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX).


In a further sign of [strong demand among top money managers](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), Idexx sports a B+ [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) and a 1.1 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand/).


The S&P 500 member has a global pawprint, with more than 9,000 employees, and customers in over 175 countries. Headquartered in Maine, Idexx is also a worldwide leader of diagnostic tests and information for livestock and poultry. It also tests for the quality and safety of water and milk and point-of-care diagnostics for human medicine.


IDXX Stock Diagnoses Potential Breakout
---------------------------------------


With earnings due next week, IDXX stock is trading just below a 561.62 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a just-completed [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/chart-reading-for-beginners-chart-patterns-cup-with-handle-double-bottom-flat-base/). While forming that [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/), the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) fell off its prior highs, but has been rebounding off its lows.


Idexx posted four consecutive up weeks beginning at the end of March and retook its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/). On Wednesday, it came off its lows to close fractionally higher for the day. It's been drifting slightly lower as it formed a handle in light volume.


Look for Idexx to bite into a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/) in heavy volume at least 40% above its daily average to show investor conviction for the move.

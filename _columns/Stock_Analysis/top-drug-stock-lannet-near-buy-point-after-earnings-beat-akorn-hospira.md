With the market outlook improving and [leading stocks showing healthier action](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/021115-738944-molina-stages-big-breakout.htm), generic drugmaker **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) is closing in on a potential buy point.

  

The Philadelphia-based firm, which is in the same Medical-Generic Drugs industry group as top-rated pharmaceutical stocks **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) and **Hospira** ([HSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSP)), develops treatments for thyroid deficiency, migraines, epilepsy and other conditions.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Lannett has posted triple-digit earnings growth in each of the past eight quarters. While growth slowed somewhat for the most recent fiscal Q2 report, it was still a strong 163% and beat estimates. Revenue gains have also been robust, coming in at 71% to 105% the past five quarters.

  

For the full fiscal year, analysts expect earnings to rise 108%, then slow significantly next year. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher, so see if the 2016 outlook continues to improve.

  

Lannett sports a robust 33% return on equity and stellar 368% three-year annual EPS growth rate, earning it the highest possible 99 Composite Rating.

  

As you like to see when a stock nears a possible buy point, Lannett has a strong B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating. The rise in fund ownership in recent quarters is another sign of institutional demand.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Lannett launched a huge run in January 2013, rising over 750% in just 14 months. But things have been bumpy since last March. After forming two bases that ended up failing, Lannett is hoping its third pattern will be the charm.

  

Since the lows in the three recent consolidations did not undercut the lows in the prior patterns to reset the base count, the current formation is a riskier late-stage base. On the positive side, the depth of the corrections has become gradually shallower, a sign of improving institutional support.

  

Also, as Lannett has been nearing the 59.54 buy point, volume has picked up and the Relative Strength line has been trending higher. Both are bullish signs ahead of a potential breakout.

Today we'll check in on social media giant, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which we last featured on Dec. 5.

  

A lot has happened with the company since then. In February, they bought WhatsApp — a hugely popular texting service — for $19 billion in cash and stock. WhatsApp had 450 million users at the time, and has now hit the half-billion mark.

  

Just one month later, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced they were spending another $2 billion to buy Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset maker.

  

And earlier this week, Facebook announced a slew of new products and features, including a new mobile ad exchange, known as Facebook Audience Network. The goal is to let developers better monetize their apps — and, of course, help Facebook more money in the process.

**Key Fundamentals**

  

We're now two years past Facebook's famously flawed IPO in May 2012. In the first two quarters after going public, they reported 0% earnings growth, but that changed in 2013, as the company figured out how to make money in the rapidly growing mobile market.

  

In the first quarter of this year, Facebook easily beat estimates on both earnings and sales, posting EPS growth of 183% and revenue gains of 72%.

  

For the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 62%, followed by a 28% gain in 2015.

  

But Facebook is not without flaws.

  

After some heavy selling in recent weeks, Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has dropped to the worst-possible E. Watch to see if that improves to at least a C or better as the stock works on the right side of its current base.

  

A longer term way to gauge institutional demand is to look for a rise in the number of funds that own a stock, and we've definitely seen that in Facebook in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the weekly MarketSmith chart on this page, after the sharp sell-off following its 2012 IPO, Facebook got its mojo back with this big breakout from a double bottom in July of last year. That came on its first strong earnings report in several quarters.

  

The stock ran up for three months, then pulled back to form this second-stage cup pattern.

  

On Dec. 5, we featured Facebook in the IBD Stock Analysis, as it was working on the right side of that base. So you could have had it on your watch list when it broke out a couple of weeks later.

  

Facebook rose about 32% over the next three months, then pulled back to start working on its current consolidation.

  

It's not yet clear what type of pattern this will become, but here are a couple of things to note.

  

First, look how the stock found support right around the buy point in the prior base. So this former area of resistance has now become an area of support. That's a positive sign, and could mean Facebook is forming a new stepping stone as it prepares to climb higher.

  

Second, this current consolidation will be a third-stage base. These later-stage bases can work, but note that they can be more risky, since the stock has already made a big gain at this point.

  

If it ends up being a cup, the ideal buy point would be 72.59, 10 cents above the peak on the left. If Facebook forms a handle, the buy point would be 10 cents above the peak in that handle.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-facebook-inc-cl-a-fb.aspx) shows Facebook's 95 Composite Rating is the third highest among the 52 stocks in the Internet-Content industry group.

  

And the group is ranked No. 97 among IBD's 197 groups.

When looking for top-rated tech stocks, keep an eye on **Epam Systems**, ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) which recaptured its 50-day line this week and is closing in on a potential buy point.

  

The IT outsourcing and software development services firm is officially headquartered in Pennsylvania, but the bulk of its workforce is in Central and Eastern Europe. While Russian aggression in the region raised concerns, [Epam'sÂ expansion into Western Europe has eased worries about the Ukraine crisis.](http://ibdtv.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/738260-tech-stock-watch-list-epam-near-buy-point.aspx)

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Epam's strong and steady growth has also calmed jittery investors. Revenue gains have come in between 26% and 38% over the last eight quarters, and earnings growth has ranged from 30% to 40% in the last four reports. Top- and bottom-line numbers both accelerated in Q3. Epam is expected to release Q4 numbers on Feb. 25.

  

Helped by a 24% return on equity, 43% three-year annual EPS growth rate and 96 EPS Rating, Epam earns the highest possible 99 Composite Rating. It also sports a solid B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, and its fund ownership has been on the rise in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After its 2012 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm), Epam made a big move from around $14 to over $46 in just two years. It then reset its base count and is now working on a new, flat base with a 52.99 buy point. Most of the base formed under the 10-week moving average, which is not ideal, but Epam moved decisively above that line earlier this week. On Wednesday, the stock rose over 6% and closed at the top of the price range on volume 9% above average. It added to those gains on Thursday and Friday.

  

Another positive sign is that the Relative Strength line has been trending higher ahead of a potential breakout.

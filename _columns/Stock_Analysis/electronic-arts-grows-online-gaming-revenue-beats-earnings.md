After delivering better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week, video game publisher **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) shot higher and is now testing a new buy point. 


Earnings for Chinese game provider **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) also impressed investors, as did numbers for **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) earlier in the month. **Nvida** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which makes chips for computers and game consoles, also blew past estimates, sending the stock sharply higher Friday and Monday.


Grand Theft Auto franchise creator **Take-Two Interactive** ([TTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTWO)) is scheduled to report its latest earnings on May 18.


Recurring Digital Revenue
-------------------------


As the video game industry transitions from physical software and, eventually, even from dedicated consoles like the **Sony** ([SNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNE)) PlayStation and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Xbox to online gaming platforms, the challenge and opportunity for EA comes down to two key words: "recurring" and "digital."


The Redwood City, Calif.-based company has been successfully expanding online engagement among players of hit titles like FIFA Ultimate Team and last week’s launch of Live Event Competitions for EA Sports UFC 2.  


Last year, CFO Blake Jorgensen noted that "people now play games on our platforms from anywhere from six to 12 months, where they typically before were doing it six to 12 weeks at the most." 


Numbers for fiscal 2016 Q4, which ended March 31, reflected EA’s growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue. For the full fiscal year, 55% of EA’s non-GAAP net revenue of $4.57 billion came from digital.


The company has no significant debt and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% annual EPS growth rate, has attracted a rising number of funds with a position in the stock. Plus, three typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts, including Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) and American Century All Cap Growth ([TWGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWGTX)).


Early-Stage Base
----------------


EA reset its base count in February by undercutting the low in the prior base, making its current consolidation a first-stage pattern. 


After reporting earnings May 1, the stock jumped over 17% for the week on volume 162% higher than normal. 


On Monday, Electronic Arts added to those gains to move closer to a 77.02 buy point, as the Relative Strength line headed into new high ground. 


The stock’s combination of rebounding fundamentals, institutional demand and technical strength in its chart could offer a buying opportunity if it clears the entry in heavy volume. But given the seesaw action in the general market, be sure to also have a defensive plan in place for any new buys you make.

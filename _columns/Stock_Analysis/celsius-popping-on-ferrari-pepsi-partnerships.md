Energy drink brand **Celsius Holdings** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) continues to bubble higher on fresh deals with soft drink giant **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) and legendary carmaker **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)). Now as RACE stock drives into buy range, CELH stock punches through resistance into potential buy range.




Celsius — which went public in 2017 — has already established a global footprint, offering products in 10 countries. The company says its proprietary, clinically proven energy drinks offer significant [health benefits](https://www.celsius.com/the-science/), including accelerating metabolism and burning fat when exercising.


Although Celsius did not make this month's list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-invest-billions-in-this-unexpected-list-of-7-magnificent-stocks-including-nvidia/), the company's impressive growth has generated seven quarters of rising fund ownership. The number of funds that own shares of CELH stock has jumped from 536 to 852 over the last four quarters. Plus, 22 funds with an A+ or A rating from IBD have a position in Celsius.


By comparison, 18 such funds own shares of Ferrari. Given its much longer corporate history and record of institutional sponsorship, PepsiCo dwarfs both stocks, with 425 top-rated funds owning shares of the soft drink and snack foods powerhouse.


Celsius Joins Team Ferrari For Global Partnership
-------------------------------------------------


Earlier this month, Celsius formed a global energy drink partnership with [Scuderia Ferrari](https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/2024/02/celsius-signs-global-energy-drink-partnership-with-scuderia-ferrari/). Celsius aims to energize Scuderia Ferrari team drivers, crew and fans on and off the track with its beverages.


As a global Scuderia Ferrari Team Partner for the 2024 season and beyond, Celsius seeks to energize the Ferrari drivers and team members throughout an intense '24 Grand Prix season. Celsius also wants Scuderia Ferrari fans to imbibe on and off the track, wherever its energy drinks are sold.


In January, [Celsius expanded its partnership](https://www.celsiusholdingsinc.com/2024/01/celsius-expands-to-canada-united-kingdom-and-ireland/) with PepsiCo, growing its global sales and distribution footprint to consumers in Canada.


Building on the distribution agreement that began in the U.S. in 2022, PepsiCo now serves as the exclusive distributor for Celsius in Canada, where sales began last month.


Celsius has also selected Suntory Beverage & Food in Great Britain and Ireland as its exclusive sales and distribution partner in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland. Sales in these regions are set to begin this year.


CELH Stock Pops Higher In Heavy Volume
--------------------------------------


Learning [how to read stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/) comes down to understanding the concept of [support and resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#supportandresistance). Recent action in Celsius highlights that fact.


From the end of its first month of trading following its IPO in May 2017 until hitting a new high in September of 2023, shares of CELH stock soared nearly 5,000%. But that massive move was anything but smooth.


Along the way, Celsius encountered multiple periods of surges, slides and sideways action.


Throughout that time, investors could use stock charts to navigate both [when to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) and [when to sell](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/) by monitoring support and resistance at key points. These noteworthy testing grounds could be at key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). They can also come at telltale price areas, such as [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and [other types of buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/you-are-now-entering-the-buy-zone-or-the-stock-investing-rule-on-buying/).


On Friday, Celsius popped past resistance around 63 after finding support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Clearing that ceiling in heavy volume can offer investors a chance to pick up shares.


Shares of CELH stock closed Friday's session at 64.41. The energy drink maker has now closed higher in eight of the last nine days, notching more than a 10% gain for the week.


Investors might also view a 68.95 buy point in a second-stage [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) as another potential entry. Like all buy points, that entry is also based on the most recent point of resistance — the peak in the consolidation pattern.


Apply that same approach to RACE stock. Ferrari closed Thursday's session near the top of its buy range after punching through its 372.42 buy point, its most recent line of resistance. The legendary racing brand closed the week 4% above its inital entry.


PepsiCo continues to trade right along its 10-week moving average. But it has yet to clear resistance at its 40-week line.

Recent security breaches and global ransomware attacks have underscored the importance of computer security. Cybersecurity can be a lucrative business, and this leading stock is proof.









 
 
  **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) came into focus after the [WannaCry ransomware cyberattack](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/fireeye-proofpoint-mimecast-top-wannacry-plays-says-goldman-sachs/) in mid-May. The ransomware compromised computers as it took advantage of vulnerabilities in some **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) operating systems. After a computer was disabled, a message would appear demanding a ransom payment to free up the computer.
In terms of fundamentals, the company has turned a 15 cent per share loss in 2015 into an estimated 59 cent per share profit for 2017. Meanwhile, the company was profitable the past four quarters after posting losses in the year-ago periods. Revenue growth has exceeded 40% over the past four quarters.


The computer software security industry has been hovering just outside the top 40 industry group — ranked [No. 57 out of 197](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jul-20-2017/).


Other leadership within the group includes [IPO Leader](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)). Alarm is extended from a 33.70 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point, while Fortinet is trading about 2% below a 41.43 cup-shaped base entry after Wednesday's breakout.



Gains were choppy, volatile and short-lived after Proofpoint broke out above an 84.46 buy point on May 15. The stock triggered a round-trip [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) on June 12 when shares briefly gave back all of an 11% advance in just two days. However, the stock did manage to close strongly on that day.


But now, the stock is forming a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) formation with a 94.43 entry. Compared to that prior base, trading has been much more orderly and much less choppy.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-proofpoint-inc-pfpt.aspx), institutional accumulation is strong as evidenced by the stock's 1.7 up/down volume ratio and a B [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/).


Quarterly earnings are due out Thursday after the market close, which may act as a key catalyst for the stock price. Analysts expect the company's earnings to increase 100% to 12 cents per share on revenues totaling $119.6 million.


If the stock breaks out ahead of earnings, it is typically best to have at least a 5% profit cushion heading into earnings to help mitigate any severe downside losses.

Today we're going to look at **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)), which was featured in the Feb. 6 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/020514-688993-cree-shines-with-brightest-led-lights.htm).

  

They make LED lights that don't use much energy.

  

And they recently introduced what they call the industry's brightest LED module with high color quality.

  

While LEDs have made inroads as an energy-efficient lighting option, making them bright enough to compete with traditional lighting —and have good color quality — has been a challenge.

  

What sets Cree apart from the competition is the unique technology they use to make their modules, which deliver more light per watt, making them more efficient.

  

Cree uses silicon carbide in manufacturing the LEDs. Everybody else uses sapphire. And analysts say that helps them make LEDs that are better performing.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Earnings climbed 44% in each of the past two quarters. 

  

• Meanwhile, sales growth ranged from 20% to 24% the past four quarters. 

  

• Going forward, analysts predict earnings will climb 27% this year and 28% next year. 

  

****Stock Checkup****

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-cree-inc-cree.aspx) shows Cree's 71 Composite Rating ranks No. 19 among the 42 stocks in its Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.

  

And that group is ranked No. 55 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

On the MarketSmith daily chart on this page, you can see Cree is forming a base.

  

And you'll notice the low point in that pattern undercuts the low in the previous base.

  

So that resets the base count and makes the current pattern a first-stage base.

  

As of Tuesday morning, it's trading about 21% below its old high. So it still has some work to do before it's in a position to break out.

  

Also, with the market in a correction, it's not a good time to be buying stocks. Still, Cree may be one to watch when the next uptrend rolls around.

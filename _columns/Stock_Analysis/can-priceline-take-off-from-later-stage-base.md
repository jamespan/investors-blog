Travel booking leader **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is working on a new base 1 and sports an improved Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

That rating fell to a worst-possible E as the stock formed the base's left side. That told you institutional investors were heavily selling the stock over the trailing 13 weeks.

  

Lately, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a C-, as Priceline has climbed up the right side of its pattern. Yet, the up/down volume ratio remains weak.

  

Priceline's current base counts as a third-stage structure. The stock reset its base count last summer as a deep, cup-shaped base 2 undercut the low of a prior pattern 3.

  

The name-your-own-price pioneer's second base was a base-on-base formed in November 2010 through February 2011 4.

  

Breakouts from late-stage bases can work. But they are riskier, so keep that in mind if Priceline breaks out.

  

If the stock ends up forming a cup-without-handle base, the ideal buy point will be at 561.98, or 10 cents above the left-side peak.

  

Priceline's Relative Strength line is near a new high, which is a favorable sign.

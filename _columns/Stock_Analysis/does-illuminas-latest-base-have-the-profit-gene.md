Technology from **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), a leader in genetic test equipment, has helped bring down the costs of genomic testing in recent years. And it just launched an initiative to develop standardized FDA-approved kits to improve cancer diagnostic and treatment decisions.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Sales growth has been solid and steady, ranging from 21% to 29% over the past eight quarters. And revenue gains moved higher in the last two reports.

  

Earnings growth also has been on the rise, accelerating from 7% to 33% over the past two quarters.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 27%, followed by a 24% gain in 2015. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

Illumina has a solid 18% return on equity and 25% annual pretax profit margin, helping it earn the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. While the number of funds that own the stock dipped slightly last quarter, its B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate institutional buying in recent weeks.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

After breaking out in April 2013, Illumina rallied as much as 220% in just 11 months.

  

It then pulled back to form a cup-with-handle, as it slipped below its 10-week line and the tone in the chart changed from the tight trading of prior months to choppier action.

  

Illumina eventually broke out in June but pulled back to trigger the 8% sell rule. It's now working on a tighter cup-with-handle.

  

While the current formation is technically a first-stage base-on-base due to an undercut in October, keep in mind that Illumina already made a huge advance last year.

  

The current buy point is 182.37, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

**Roper Technologies** ([ROP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROP)) describes itself as a diversified technology company that develops software and engineered products for 'niche end markets.' It's clearly found its niche, as 131 of the [best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-buy-apple-adobe-ross/) with an A+ rating have taken a position in the company.




Headquartered in Sarasota, Fla., Roper engineers products and solutions for a range of industries, including medical and scientific imaging, industrial technology, and energy systems and controls. It also develops radio frequency identification (RFID) technology used in toll and traffic systems, security and access control, campus card systems and various other applications.


In May, Roper announced it was [buying PowerPlan](http://www.ropertech.com/roper-technologies-acquire-powerplan-leading-provider-software-and-solutions-financial-and) for $1.1 billion. PowerPlan provides software that helps customers optimize financial performance and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Roper expects PowerPlan to generate around $150 million in revenue and $60 million of after-tax free cash flow within the first 12 months of the acquisition.

Software Stock To Watch

Roper Technologies is not a high-flying growth stock, but it has been moving steadily higher for years. Since the crash in 2008, the stock has risen from a low of around 34 to over 300 today.


Roper is now working on a flat base with a 312.48 buy point. The [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-chart-reading-for-beginners/) is part of a second-stage base-on-base.


The stock gapped up Monday, but eased back to close the session up just under 1% to 306.25. Roper is now trading 2% below the entry and its relative strength line is just shy of a new high.

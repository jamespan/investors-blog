**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are all Magnificent Seven stocks. But only [MSFT stock](https://www.investors.com/research/microsoft-stock-buy-now/) makes the highly selective [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) list.




Note that Microsoft also just topped the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/msft-stock-leads-new-buys-by-best-mutual-funds-this-sector-sees-strong-demand/), raking in a whopping $17.4 billion from these high performing money managers. The artificial intelligence and cloud giant was the only one of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) to make this screen.


At one time, [GOOGL stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/) also earned placement as an IBD Long-Term Leader but has since fallen off. So why do artificial intelligence leaders and tech powerhouses [NVDA](https://www.investors.com/news/nvidia-stock-2023-buy-now/), [AAPL](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-downgraded-on-growth-concerns/), [AMZN](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/is-amazon-stock-buy-now-amzn/), [META](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-meta-uber-top-best-ideas-list-for-2024-at-wedbush/) and [TSLA](https://www.investors.com/news/is-tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-right-now-as-elon-musk-teases-cybertruck/) also not make the list?


In a word, [earnings stability](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/earnings-growth-is-essential-but-better-when-its-also-steady-heres-how-to-find-it/). While strong quarterly and annual earnings growth is essential, it's even better when steady.


Earnings Stability: Secret Sauce For MSFT Stock Investors
---------------------------------------------------------


Along with solid growth and price performance, earnings stability forms the foundation for placement among the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-long-term-stocks/). It's an approach that blends the investing strategies of two great investors: [Warren Buffett](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stocks/), head of **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), and [IBD founder William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-ibd-founder-canslim-creator/).


Buffett uses the classic buy-and-hold strategy, finding great long-term investments and holding them for years at a time. Simply put, O'Neil's [CAN SLIM method](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) entails actively trading high-growth stocks over weeks and months, rather than Buffett's years-to-decades style.


Based on three to five years of earnings' history, the [earnings stability rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/earnings-growth-is-essential-but-better-when-its-also-steady-heres-how-to-find-it/) provides a scale ranging from 0 to 99. Unlike the higher-the-better [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/), lower numbers represent more stable company earnings history. Microsoft currently earns a strong 6 rating.


Nine other companies join Microsoft on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list, including **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)), **KLAC** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)).

MSFT Stock Holds Up While NVDA, TSLA, AAPL Slip
-----------------------------------------------


After a stellar 2023, the [Magnificent Seven stocks ran into some resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/magnificent-seven-stocks-like-nvidia-microsoft-amazon-meta-in-2024-set-to-rock-on-or-roll-over/) to kick off the new year. Apple stock has dropped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) to now test its 200-day line after getting [another downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-gets-another-downgrade/) as Wall Street sours on the iPhone maker. Tesla has fallen beneath the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) but has so far found support at its 50-day benchmark.


Landing on [multiple buy lists for 2024](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-lands-on-multiple-buy-lists-for-2024/), Nvidia stock has shown resilience, bouncing above its 21-day line, as has Meta stock. GOOGL stock and Microsoft also now trade below that line.


Amazon has retreated to test its 50-day moving average.


On a weekly chart, Microsoft has held relatively tight, now building a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/#flatbase) as part of a base-on-base formation. This new pattern offers a 384.30 buy point following a breakout in November.


The chart for MSFT stock shows institutional investors maintaining their positions. While several analysts have [put Microsoft on their lists of top picks for 2024](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-has-these-major-catalysts-ahead-in-2024/), it continues to feel pressure, closing lower for the first trading week of the year. It now faces a test of its 50-day line heading into week two.


As the setups and pullbacks in Microsoft and the other Magnificent Seven stocks play out, keep a close eye on the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/). The tech-heavy Nasdaq has stumbled in the first days of trading in 2024, falling below the 15,000 mark and now its 21-day line. But it remains well above its 50-day line.


See if selling pressure subsides and continue to monitor any changes in IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/). On Wednesday as the indexes continued to pull back, the recommended level got reduced to 60% to 80%, down from 80% to 100%.

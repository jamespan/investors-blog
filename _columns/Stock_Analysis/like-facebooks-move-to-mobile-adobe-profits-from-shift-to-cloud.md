**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) may have helped pioneer the concepts of ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) and cloud computing, but **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) has aggressively embraced - and profited from - both trends in recent years. 


In 2013, Adobe switched from selling Photoshop, Illustrator and other popular software programs to renting them to users as a subscription service. 


The Silicon Valley-based company now applies the subscription and cloud-based services model to its three core offerings: Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Marketing Cloud  and Adobe Document Cloud.

Last week, Adobe announced it will acquire [audience engagement firm Livefyre](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-systems-acquires-livefyre-to-strengthen-marketing-cloud/) to enhance the Adobe Marketing Cloud. Livefyre will be incorporated into the Adobe Experience Manager, allowing marketers to better engage customers by bringing together content from **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Instagram and other social media platforms. 


Cloud-Based Turnaround
----------------------


Just as Facebook's aggressive shift to mobile platforms beginning in 2012 has boosted its earnings and its stock, Adobe’s shift to a new cloud-based business model has sparked a solid turnaround in its fundamentals. 


While its three-year annual earnings growth rate still stands at a tepid 5%, the company’s average EPS growth over the last three quarters is 67% and it sports a 27.8% annual pre-tax profit margin.


Revenue growth has come in between 21% and 25% in the last three reports. 


For fiscal 2016, which ends November 30, analysts expect earnings to rise 37%, followed by a 33% gain in fiscal 2017. 


Institutional demand for the [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/) stock is reflected in the B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio. Plus, four typically better-performing funds have reported a position in the Adobe, including Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and MFS Growth (MFEGX).


Floating Near Buy Point
-----------------------


Adobe Systems reset its base count in February, and is now working on a first-stage base-on-base formation. 


[![Markup_ADBE](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Markup_ADBE-300x278.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Markup_ADBE.jpg)On March 18, the stock gapped up and tried to break out of the first part of the base-on-base after reporting earnings. Volume spiked 198% above average, but the stock gave back a large chunk of the day's gains and soon began building flat base as the second part of the formation.


Trading within the flat base has been tight, with good support along the 10-week moving average line. The Relative Strength line is approaching new high ground as the stock tries to close in on the 98.10 buy point. Also note how trading on up days has generally been higher than on down days.


See if Adobe can clear the entry on volume at least 40% higher than normal. And make sure you have a defensive plan in place since several breakouts have stumbled or stalled in this market.

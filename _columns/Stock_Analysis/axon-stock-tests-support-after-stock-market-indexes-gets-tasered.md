Before the [market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) got tasered on Thursday, [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) member **Axon** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) soared to a one-week gain of more than 23% last month. The stock is now testing support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/technical-analysis-3-clues-to-look-for-in-amazon-nvidia-netflix/).




Formerly known as Taser, Axon has a moonshot goal of [cutting gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% in 10 years](https://www.thisisourmoonshot.com/). In 2021, there were 1,118 such fatalities.


Based in Scottsdale, the company offers security and safety solutions for a range of industries, including [law enforcement](https://www.axon.com/industries/law-enforcement), [corrections](https://www.axon.com/industries/corrections), [campus](https://www.axon.com/campus-safety-solutions), [personal safety](https://taser.com/) and more.


Earlier this month, the safety technology leader received an upgrade to the [highest security level](https://investor.axon.com/2022-12-20-AXON-CLOUD-UPGRADED-TO-HIGHEST-LEVEL-OF-SECURITY-STATUS-BY-US-GENERAL-SERVICES-ADMINISTRATION) by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ([FedRAMP](https://www.axon.com/fedramp)) Joint Authorization Board for its cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.


The change will allow Axon's government customers to store the most sensitive, unclassified data handled by federal civilian agencies.


The Axon FedCloud system operates as an isolated region of Axon Cloud Services dedicated to the U.S. Federal community. Its offerings include Axon Evidence, Axon Respond and Axon Records. It also acts as the core control center over Axon devices and client applications.


Axon Secures Support Among The Best Mutual Funds
------------------------------------------------


Together with **Napco Security** ([NSSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSSC)), Axon locks down top ranking in the Security-Safety industry group. Both stocks earn strong 97 [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/stocks-to-watch-companies-with-top-stock-ratings/) in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-axon-enterprise-axon.aspx). The industry ranks No. 25 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.


Indicating strong [institutional support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-i-in-can-slim-how-institutional-investors-can-make-or-break-growth-stocks-a-key-to-profitable-investing/), Axon made the latest list of [new buys by the best mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-bet-on-medical-stocks-lly-mrk-abbv-amgn-add-retailers-to-holiday-shopping-bag/). The company sports a "B+" [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) and an impressive 1.9 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/). Plus, 68 funds with an "A+" or "A" rating own shares in AXON stock.


Quarterly earnings growth has been mixed, ranging from stellar to stalled. But over the last three years, Axon has sparked average EPS gains of 47%.


With the exception of a 4% slowdown in Q4 of last year, sales have been strong and steady. In seven of the last eight quarters, revenue growth has ranged from 31% to 55%.


Can Security Stock Lock Down Support At 10-Week Line?
-----------------------------------------------------


After reporting earnings on Nov. 8, Axon gapped up to a one-day gain of nearly 15%. It continued to rise, ending the week over 23% higher. The stock then ran into resistance and traded sideways until pulling back earlier this month.


The security technology leader now looks to secure support at its 10-week lineÂ as the market indexes continue to get zapped and come under pressure.


Both the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) and 10-week line have soared since the Taser pioneer came off May lows. But the sell-off in the market indexes has caused the RS line to slide below its earlier highs.


Axon managed to come off its lows slightly on Thursday and and hold support at its 50-day line to close the week.


While current market conditions endanger all stocks, see if Axon can shake off that selling pressure and build on the heavy-volume gains it made since breaking out in October.

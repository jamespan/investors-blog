Genuine Parts Expands European Presence
---------------------------------------


Global in scale, Genuine Parts distributes automotive replacement parts in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe.


In the U.S., it sells over 650,000 parts, primarily sold under the NAPA brand. Through its Alliance Automotive Group, it serves the U.K., France, Germany, Poland, Australia and other countries under a variety of banners.


Through its global network, Genuine Parts serves both the retail and commercial automotive aftermarket segments.


In April, Genuine Parts announced a move into [new markets in Spain and Portugal](https://www.genpt.com/2022-04-13-Genuine-Parts-Company-Announces-Automotive-Acquisition-in-Europe,-Expanding-Presence-into-Key-New-Markets-in-Spain-and-Portugal).


The company generated $5.3 billion in revenue last quarter. That tops peers AutoZone ($3.7 billion), Advance Auto Parts ($3.4 billion) and O'Reilly ($3.3 billion).


Genuine Parts also has driven two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth, rising from a 15% EPS increase in Q3 of last year to a 24% rise in Q1.


GPC Stock Revs Motor While ORLY, AAP Stall
------------------------------------------


As O'Reilly and Advance Auto Parts struggle to gain traction amid recent declines, Genuine Parts has its eyes on a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). GPC stock is forming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) showing a 141.21 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


In February, Genuine Parts undercut the low in its prior formation to [reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). That makes the current [chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-market-trends-moving-averages-nvidia-netflix-amazon/) a first-stage base. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is near a new high.


Fellow auto parts retailer AutoZone is trying to hold at its [50-line line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) as it forms a new [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).

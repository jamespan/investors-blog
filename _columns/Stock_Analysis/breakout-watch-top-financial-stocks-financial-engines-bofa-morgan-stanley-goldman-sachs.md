Wall Street has been enthusiastic about financial stocks like **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) recently, but here's a lesser-known name investors should not ignore: Silicon Valley-based investment advisor **Financial Engines** ([FNGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGN)).
Like BofA, JPMorgan and other financial sector stocks, Financial Engines shot higher in the weeks following Donald Trump's election, then paused to consolidate those gains, trying to launch the next leg of a sustained climb.


No. 1 Rank Among Industry Peers
-------------------------------


As America's largest independent investment advisor, Financial Engines works with companies to provide retirement and other financial-planning advice to their employees. It serves over 9 million people across more than 700 companies, including 147 of the Fortune 500 firms.


In November, the company announced it was now serving over a million managed account clients, with more than $134 billion in assets.


Boosted by a 97 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) and three quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth, Financial Engines holds the No. 1 rank within the investment management industry group, followed by **Stellus Capital Investment** ([SCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCM)), **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), **Apollo Global Management** ([APO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APO)) and **Harvest Capital Credit** ([HCAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCAP)).


Financial Engines is expected to report Q4 earnings on Feb. 16.


Rising RS Line Ahead Of Breakout
--------------------------------


After rising over 180% from November 2012 to December 2013, Financial Engines fell into a multiyear slump. But the stock has been rebounding and is forming a flat base with good support at its 10-week line.



Although fund ownership dipped slightly last quarter, an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.7 up/down volume ratio point to institutional demand.


On Thursday, Financial Engines was down over 2% during the day, but recouped enough of that decline to close in the top half of the price range. Volume rose sharply higher Friday, but didn't give up much ground. See if the stock can find support and clear the 40.05 buy point in heavy trade.

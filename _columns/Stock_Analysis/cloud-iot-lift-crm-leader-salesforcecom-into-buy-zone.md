Long before everyone was talking about mobile computing and the Internet of Things, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was pioneering the concept of cloud-based software.

  

The leader in customer relationship management continues to innovate, helping push its stock into a buy zone ahead of Q3 earnings.

  

The stock got a boost Tuesday on news that Salesforce.com's subsidiary, Salesforce Ventures, would invest $100 million in European startups to expand the use of cloud services in the region.

  

At last month's Dreamforce 2015 conference, CEO Marc Benioff announced SalesforceIQ, a CRM solution for small business, and an IoT cloud service offering called Thunderbird.

  

Just weeks later, Amazon, which already has the largest cloud business with Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced its own Internet of Things-focused offering called AWS IoT.

  

**Does Salesforce.com Get Passing Grades?**

  

The stock earns a 98 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 98% of all stocks in terms of key fundamental and technical criteria.

  

Salesforce.com has posted robust revenue growth in each of the past eight quarters, and its five-year annual sales growth rate is 34%.

  

The company says it's set to become the fourth largest software firm in the world by 2016, behind Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.

  

Earnings growth has also been strong, ranging from 44% to 100% over the past five quarters.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS to rise 40%, followed by a 32% gain in 2016. Estimates for both years were recently revised higher.

  

The stock also earns passing grades for its B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

**Is Salesforce.com Near A Potential Buy Zone?**

  

The stock is showing two potential entries: a traditional buy point of 78.56 — 10 cents above the peak on the left — and a more aggressive 76.31 entry — 10 cents above a prior point of resistance within the base.

  

Salesforce.com cleared the 76.31 price point on Tuesday, but gave back a large chunk of the day's gains to close in the bottom half of the price range.

  

Volume was 32% above average, slightly below the 40% minimum spike you prefer to see on the day of a breakout.

  

On Wednesday, the stock pulled back below the buy point, but volume was well below average, indicating that mutual fund managers and other large investors were not selling aggressively.

  

As of Thursday morning, Salesforce.com was back above the 76.31 entry.

  

**What To Look For**

  

Market Direction: See if the current uptrend holds and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can stay above their 50-day moving average lines. If the indexes fail to gain traction, it will be difficult for any stock to move higher.

  

Q3 Earnings Season: Salesforce.com is expected to report in the second half of November, but watch how other stocks report and how the market reacts. Pay particularly attention to Salesforce.com's peers in the Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, such as **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) and **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)).

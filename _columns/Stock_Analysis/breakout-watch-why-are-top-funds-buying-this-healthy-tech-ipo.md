Only a technicality prevented health care technology stock **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) from joining **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) on IBD's list of [today's fastest-growing companies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/which-stocks-make-this-list-of-the-fastest-growing-companies/).
BioTelemetry's 238% annual EPS growth rate actually would have earned it the No. 1 spot on the list, but it didn't meet the daily average dollar volume of at least $8 million required for that particular screen.


By comparison, Mobileye's five-year earnings growth rate is 117%, while Facebook saw its growth rate rise to 59% after reporting 2016 numbers on Feb. 1. Dave & Buster's has been increasing its earnings-per-share at an annual pace of 103%.


Fund Favorite
-------------


BioTelemetry did make IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/grubhub-delivers-food-profit-for-top-funds/) for the second straight month, while Facebook, Mobileye and Dave & Buster's failed to make the grade.


From November to January, 12 funds invested approximately $4.8 million in the Internet of Things (IoT) innovator, which allows health care providers to wirelessly monitor and diagnose a patient's health using a lineup of products focused on mobile cardiac telemetry, event monitoring and self-monitoring.


The 2013 IPO's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.6 Up/Down Volume Ratio further reflect institutional demand in the company.


BioTelemetry, which was just awarded a [2017 IoT Evolution Business Impact Award](http://www.iotevolutionworld.com/newsroom/articles/429321-sprint-biotelemetry-inc-receive-2017-iot-evolution-business.htm), will undergo its own intense round of observation when it reports Q4 earnings on Feb. 22.


Monitoring A Potential Breakout
-------------------------------


The stock was featured in the [Dec. 16 IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/top-medical-stock-biotelemetry-delivers-mobile-healthcare-monitoring-devices/) just before it broke out the next day, climbing over 9% in massive volume.


BioTelemetry began pulling back a few days later to start forming the second half of a first-stage base-on-base.


Note how the stock found support right around the prior buy point and along its 10-week moving average — a sign that fund managers and other large investors were sitting tight and holding on to their shares.



The stock tried to clear a 24.20 entry on Feb. 6, but retreated to close below the buy point. As you like to see on a mild pullback, volume lightened up as the stock drifted slightly lower over the next two days.


BioTelemetry edged higher in rising volume Monday and is now trading just under the buy point, as investors wait to see if the company delivers a healthy report next week.


*UPDATE:* On Tuesday, BioTelemetry broke out in heavy volume, but gave back enough of those gains to close in the bottom half of the day's price range. But the stock still closed within the 24.20 - 25.41 buy zone. See if the stock builds on its gains Wednesday, and keep in mind that buying any stock just before earnings is risky.

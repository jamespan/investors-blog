Today we'll check in on **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), which we last featured on Jan. 10. Epam is a software engineering and IT services firm that competes with IT outsourcing companies in China and India.

  

While it's headquartered in Pennsylvania, the bulk of its workforce is in Central and Eastern Europe. As we'll see in a minute, that's one reason the stock took a hit back in March when the Ukraine crisis caused some investors to get out of stocks like Epam that do a lot of business in the region.

  

On a happier note, that same month, Epam announced it was buying Netsoft USA, a 15-year old IT company that focuses on health care-related industries. The purchase is expected to give Epam a stronger foothold in that growing sector.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Epam Systems has a track record of producing consistently strong revenue growth, with quarterly gains coming in between 26% and 32% over the last eight reports.

  

And earnings growth has accelerated during the last four quarters, rising to 34% in Q1.

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 19%, followed by a 16% gain in 2015.

  

Epam carries a solid 24% return on equity and a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 58%.

  

That's gotten the attention of institutional investors, which is reflected in Epam's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and a strong 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio.

  

Also the number of funds that own the stock has been rising in recent quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Epam Systems went public in Feb. 2012.

  

After shooting higher from a short IPO base, it formed a long, fairly choppy cup-with-handle.

  

It broke out and rose over 120% during the next 12 months.

  

The stock hit resistance in February of this year, then plunged below its 10-week line when the problems between Russia and Ukraine escalated in March. Volume for the week was 300% higher than normal, a clear sign that at least some institutional investors were aggressively dumping shares.

  

Epam wasn't alone: **QIWI** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)), **VimpelCom** ([VIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIP)) and other companies doing business in the region also took a hit.

  

The stock continued lower, and stayed below the 40-week line for several weeks.

  

Also note how the 10-week line fell below the 40-week moving average, which is a sign of weakness.

  

But things picked up when Epam reported strong and accelerating Q1 numbers at the end of April. That sparked four consecutive up weeks, and the stock is currently trying to extend that streak to five.

  

The current consolidation is a first-stage base because the most recent low undercut the low in the prior pattern. That resets the base count.

  

Keep an eye on the 10-week line and see if it can get back above the 40-week.

  

Also watch the Relative Strength Line, which has been trending sharply higher. See if it can get into or new high ground by the time of any breakout.

  

The ideal buy point is 46.80, ten cents above the peak on the left.

  

With the market now back in an uptrend, see if Epam Systems can break past that buy point on volume at least 40% - 50% above average.

**Cabela's** ([CAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAB)) sells outdoor clothing and equipment. And as a June 28 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/062713-661668-cabelas-is-no-dicks-sporting-goods.htm) noted, lately it's been on the hunt for real estate.

  

This is part of its new strategy to expand the number of stores beyond its current 44 stores. It plans to open 14 new locations this year.

  

It's also boosting its bottom line by opening smaller stores. Its old "legacy" stores are 130,000 to 200,000 square feet, whereas smaller new stores will be 80,000 to 100,000 square feet.

  

Those new stores still have the things that make Cabela's unique like the trophy animal mounts, mountain replicas and wildlife displays.

  

Cabela's CEO says those smaller stores tend to perform about 30% to 40% better than larger ones. It's also putting them in better locations to generate more traffic analysts say.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Like other stores that sell hunting equipment, Cabelas' has benefited from increased sales of guns and ammunition, and that's reflected in its accelerating sales growth.

  

• Earnings were up 75% last quarter, the best showing in three years.

  

• Going forward, analysts predict earnings will climb 26% this year and 13% next year.

  

**Stock Checkup**

  

[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-cabelas-inc-cab.aspx) shows Cabela's is tied with **Big 5** ([BGFV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGFV)) for the top Composite Rating in the Retail—Leisure Products industry group. So it's the group's leader.

  

The group itself is ranked No. 73 among IBD's 197 groups.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

As you can see on the MarketSmith daily chart above, Cabela's has been forming a base.

  

The price only fell 12% as that pattern has formed, so it's a flat base. Those patterns have price drops of 15% or less.

  

To find the ideal buy point in that type of pattern, just add 10 cents to the highest point in the base. But also be aware that this is a third-stage base and late-stage basis like that can have a bigger risk of failing.

  

Also, with the market in a correction, it's not a good time to be buying stocks.

  

Still, Cabela's is one of the leaders in its group, so it might be worth a spot on your watch list.

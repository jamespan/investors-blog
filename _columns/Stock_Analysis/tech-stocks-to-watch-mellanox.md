Despite recent weakness in many semiconductor stocks, **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) has emerged as one of the best tech stocks to watch, boosted by average EPS growth of 169% over the last three quarters.




[Semiconductor stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news-intel-qualcomm-qorvo/) began to retreat in September, helping spur the [market correction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/?cvid=2385970) that began in October. Over the last six weeks, the ranking of the chip designers industry group fell from No. 83 to No. 133. But it picked up Thursday, and is now ranked a still weak, but improving No. 103.


Mellanox holds the No. 2 spot in the group with a 97 Composite Rating, of a best-possible 99. **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)), which is being bought by Japan's Renesas Electronics for $6.7 billion, holds the top position with a 98 rating.


As the market bounced back into a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-soars-midterm-election-results/) on Nov. 7, Mellanox was among the top tech stocks leading the charge.

Tech Stocks To Watch: Big Data, Big Profits
-------------------------------------------


The rapid rise of Big Data, smart devices and mobile apps means big demand for cloud computing services and data centers. That's good news for Mellanox, which provides Ethernet and other high-performance connectivity products that increase data center efficiency. The Israeli company offers a range of multicore processors, network adapters, switches, and cables.


Mellanox announced that it has [shipped over 2.1 million Ethernet adapters](http://ir.mellanox.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mellanox-ships-more-21-million-ethernet-adapters-first-three) in the first three quarters of this year.


Analysts expect Mellanox to post full-year earnings growth of 114%. Actual revenue gains have ranged from 24% to 33% in the first three quarters of 2018. Note that while both earnings and sales growth are strong, they have slowed in the last three reports. See if that trend reverses in Q4.


Institutional demand for the stock has been strong. Mellanox sports a healthy 1.6 up/down volume ratio, an A [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/accumulation-distribution-rating-helps/) and three quarters of rising fund ownership.


Semiconductor Stocks Testing Buy Zones
--------------------------------------


As tech stocks rebounded and the Nasdaq rose nearly 5% on Nov. 7, Mellanox soared past a 90.55 buy point. While it did close within buy range, note that it gave back a significant portion of its intraday gains. Volume came in 363% higher than normal.


The buy zone extends to 95.08, 5% above the ideal entry.


It's a good sign to see a stock zoom higher on the first day of a new uptrend. Another bullish sign for Mellanox is how its relative strength line has hit a new 52-week high.


But keep in mind that [not all follow-through days work](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). Some will end up failing to lead to a sustained new uptrend. The nascent rally has already run into selling pressure, with tech stocks also pulling back.


Not all breakouts work, either. So keep a close eye on any new purchases and be sure to [follow sound sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) in case the trade — and the market — go against you.


In early trading Monday, Mellanox is off over 1%, but still within buy range.

Crude oil prices have climbed about 28% over the past four years, while natural gas prices have fallen about 20%.

  

So it's not surprising that **Carrizo Oil & Gas** ([CRZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRZO)) has been increasing its stake in oil-rich areas in recent years while selling off some of its natural gas plays. The firm was profiled in the Sept. 13 [New America article](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/091213-670770-carrizo-oil-and-gas-increases-oil-operation.htm).

  

Carrizo explores and produces oil and gas in several parts of the U.S. including South Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

  

The company specializes in hydraulic fracturing drilling, also known as "fracking."

  

And analysts say it's been successful its strategy of focusing on oil, which has also improved its cash margins.

  

In fact during the second quarter the firm produced more than 11,000 barrels a day, which was its best ever. That was a 54% increase from a year earlier.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

•Earnings growth cooled to just 15% in the first quarter, but jumped to 144% last quarter.

  

• Sales growth ranged from 39% to 93% the past eight quarters.

  

• Looking ahead, analysts predict earnings will climb 51% this year and 27% next year.

**Chart Analysis**

  

The MarketSmith daily chart on this page shows Carrizo broke out of an ascending base pattern in early Aug.

  

That's a somewhat uncommon pattern, but can lead to big gains. The ascending base forms after a stock breaks out of a base. Then it pulls back three times, usually over a period of nine to 16 weeks. Carrizo's base lasted a little less than 10 weeks.

  

Each pullback can be anywhere from 10% to about 20%. Carriso's pullbacks were 12%, 10% and 7% deep.

  

Here's the key feature of an ascending base: The low of each pullback is higher than the preceding one. And that was the case with Carrizo.

  

To find the buy point in that pattern, just add 10 cents to the high point in the third pullback.

  

Carrizo went on to hit a series of new highs after breaking out of its ascending base.

  

Recently it's been finding support at the 10-week moving average line. Watch to see if that support continues and if the stock gives investors other opportunities to get on board.

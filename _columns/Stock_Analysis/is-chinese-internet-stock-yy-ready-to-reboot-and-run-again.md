Today we'll look at **YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) which went public in Nov. 2012. Based in China, they provide an online communication platform that engages users in group activities through voice, text and video. YY generates revenue through ads, membership fees and by charging users for online games and YY Music.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

YY has posted outstanding quarterly earnings growth, with triple-digit gains in all but one of its last eight reports. Sales growth has also consistently been in the triple-digits.

  

YY is scheduled to report Q2 earnings Aug. 6

  

For the full year, analysts expect EPS growth of 45%, followed by a 40% rise in 2015.

  

The company sports a strong 37% return on equity, helping it earn an A for its SMR Rating and a 95 Composite Rating.

  

Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C- indicates roughly equal amounts of buying and selling by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

  

Another way to gauge institutional demand is by looking at the Up/Down Volume Ratio. Anything over 1 indicates demand, and YY comes in at a solid 1.6.

  

Institutional support is also seen in the jump in the number of funds that own YY, up from 60 to 158 over the last three quarters.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The stock has trended higher since it broke out of an IPO base in Feb. 2013, maintaining support at is 10-week moving average on several occasions during that run.

  

YY broke out of a six-week consolidation at the end of last year and climbed more than 20%. It then pulled back, tested its 10-week line, found support and climbed to an all-time high.

  

That marked at least a temporary peak in YY's big run-up from around $11 to over $90 in just 15 months. The stock began to pull back more sharply in March, falling below its 10-week line and unable to find support until it was already under its 40-week moving average.

  

This was around the same time the general market was coming under pressure, and distribution days piled up on the indexes. The outlook eventually changed to "market in correction" on March 26.

  

After finding a bottom, the stock closed higher eight weeks in a row, as it built the right side of its current cup-with-handle formation. The ideal buy point is 78.83, 10 cents above the peak in the handle.

  

But note that it's a fourth-stage base. Later-stage patterns can lead to nice gains, but they do pose more risk than a first- or second-stage consolidation.

Despite selling pressure in the market, drug distribution giant **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)) has continued to show support and resilience. As American Century mutual fund manager David Hollond noted in a [recent interview with IBD](http://news.investors.com/050515-751094-market-tilts-toward-american-century-heritage.htm), ObamaCare is boosting AmerisourceBergen by giving more people access to health insurance and prescription drugs.

  

Hollond also said that after this year, AmerisourceBergen will get a lift from "robust acceleration" in the launch of generic drugs, like those offered by **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) and **Mylan** ([MYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MYL)).

  

The Pennsylvania-based firm is already profiting from a 10-year distribution deal that it signed with **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) in 2013.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

Earnings growth has ranged from 29% to 43% over the past four quarters. Revenue gains have not been as robust, but the latest 15% increase beat estimates and was impressive in that the company already generates well north of $100 billion a year.

  

AmerisourceBergen has a stellar 43% return on equity and solid 97 Composite Rating.

  

Its A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.2 up/down volume ratio point to institutional demand. And the stock made IBD's latest list of [new buys by top-performing stock funds](http://news.investors.com/investing-mutual-funds/050515-751091-top-stock-mutual-funds-new-buys-and-latest-sells.htm).

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

The IBD Stock Analysis featured AmerisourceBergen most recently on Sept. 26, as it was forming a flat base. It broke out to launch a new run, showing tight trading that indicated strong institutional support in the face of more volatile action in the major indexes.

  

Since the market is now in a correction, it's not an ideal time to buy. But with strong fundamentals and some favorable industry trends, AmerisourceBergen may be one to keep on your watch list.

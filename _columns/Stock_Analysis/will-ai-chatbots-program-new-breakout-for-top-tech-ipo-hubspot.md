As tech titans like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) dive deeper into artificial intelligence, investors should also keep an eye on 2014 IPO **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), which has just made two acquisitions focused on AI and machine-learning technologies.









 
 
 With over 34,000 total customers and more than 3,400 agency partners, HubSpot is a leader in customer relationship management (CRM) and inbound-marketing, which attracts customers through content rather than traditional advertising.
In July, HubSpot acquired Kemvi, a startup focused on using artificial intelligence and machine learning to help sales representatives deepen relationships with potential buyers. On Wednesday, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company also announced it was buying Motion AI, a top visual-chatbot builder whose technology allows anyone to create chatbots on Facebook Messenger, Slack and other platforms.


HubSpot said Motion AI's intelligent chatbots can be used to qualify sales leads, book meetings and handle customer service issues.


While HubSpot's Q2 revenue of $89 million is a rounding error compared to last quarter's sales for Amazon ($38 billion), Alphabet ($26 billion) and Facebook ($9.3 billion), it's been growing its top line at a 52% annual pace over the last three years.


So as Amazon, Alphabet, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and other AI leaders attract institutional interest, HubSpot and other, more under-the-radar names may also be among the [early investing hot spots in artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/artificial-intelligence-investing-it-doesnt-take-a-rocket-scientist/).


A B Accumulation/Distribution Rating and eight quarters of rising fund ownership point to institutional demand for the HubSpot, which has shown a recent spike in EPS growth, with earnings in the past two reports vs. year-ago losses. The consensus analyst estimate calls for a 500% spike in earnings for 2018.


Testing New Buy Zone
--------------------


HubSpot has been on a rocky ride since its October 2014 IPO, but has been trending higher since the end of last year and has tried to break out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 76.20 buy point. The base could also be viewed as a longer [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). Either way, the entry remains the same.


After testing the buy point, the stock fell back below it, but managed to find support at its 10-day moving average, ending the week a little over 2% below the entry. See if HubSpot can retake the buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

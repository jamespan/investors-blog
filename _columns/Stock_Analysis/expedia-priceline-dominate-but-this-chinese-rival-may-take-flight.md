While **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) gets the most buzz among Chinese stocks and **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) and **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) dominate online travel booking with a [95% share of the U.S. market](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/how-the-internet-killed-60000-jobs-to-modernize-the-travel-trade/), **Ctrip.com** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)) is the travel leader in China and is trying to launch a new breakout.









 
 
 When booking a flight or hotel, it may seem like there are many online travel agencies (OTAs) to choose from — until you realize Hotels.com, Travelocity, HomeAway, Orbitz.com and several others are owned by Expedia, and Booking.com, Kayak, rentalcars.com and even restaurant reservation service OpenTable are owned by Priceline.
Expedia also recently spun off online hotel search platform **Trivago** ([TRVG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRVG)), which had its IPO in 2016.


While Ctrip only has about one-third the revenue of its larger rivals, it's growing faster as it focuses on the Chinese and other Asian markets.


Ctrip's three-year annual revenue growth rate is 51%, compared with 22% for Expedia and 14% for Priceline.


Last year, Ctrip also invested $180 million in **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), India's largest online travel industry, in a deal that allows Ctrip to own up to 26.6% of the company's outstanding shares.


Earnings growth is more erratic for Ctrip, ranging from -87% to 191% over the last four quarters. Analysts see -150% growth in the current quarter, but are expecting a 174% gain in 2018.


Ctrip isn't expected to report until the end of August.


Institutional Demand
--------------------


Unlike Alibaba, **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), Ctrip was not among the [seven Chinese stocks on IBD's latest list of new buys by top funds](https://www.investors.com/research/which-chinese-stocks-are-top-fund-managers-buying-alibaba-netease-autohome-yy/). But it has shown signs of institutional demand, including a 1.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio and eight quarters of rising fund ownership.


Ctrip was also recently named a "Most Honored Company" by Institutional Investor, with top executives listed among the "Best CEOs" and "Best CFOs." Ctrip was also noted for having one of the "Best Investor Relations Programs."


Booking A New Breakout
----------------------


When this story was originally published on July 25, Ctrip was still working on an early stage flat base with a 58.68 buy point and trading just below its all-time high.


Then on Wednesday the stock broke out and ended the session 2% above the buy point. The buy range extends to 61.61. Volume was 19% above average and much much higher than the trading in recent days.


In a sign of technical strength, Ctrip's RS line moved into new high ground and the 10-day moving average has climbed back above the longer term 50-day line.


At the open Thursday, Ctrip was up again and still within the buy zone, but that changed in the afternoon as the general market reversed sharply.


Ctrip also pulled back to fall below the buy point, but found support at its 10-day moving average and was back just within buy zone by the close.

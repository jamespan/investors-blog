Top-rated chipmaker **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) broke out Thursday morning after saying earlier that [Q1 revenue should be better than previously expected](http://news.investors.com/technology/040815-746926-silicon-motion-revenue-projections-beat-expectations.htm).

  

The Taiwan-based producer of control and memory components, which is in the same semiconductor industry group as **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) supplier **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone supplier **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), said first-quarter revenue should be "roughly flat sequentially" rather than decline as originally projected. Earnings are expected to be released April 27.

  

**Key Fundamentals**

  

After posting negative growth in 2013 and the first quarter of last year, Silicon Motion's fundamentals have turned around. Revenue growth has come in between 19% and 53% over the last three quarters, while earnings growth has ranged from 52% to 78% during the same period.

  

For the full year, analysts expected EPS to rise 25%, followed by a 13% gain in 2016.

  

The company's 19% return on equity clears the 17% minimum you should look for and that, together with a 24.8% pre-tax profit margin, earns the company an 'A' SMR Rating.

  

The stock also has a solid 98 Composite Rating. Its 'B' Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates moderate institutional buying over the last three months.

  

**Chart Analysis**

  

Silicon Motion has been working on a second-stage [base-on-base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/746079-learn-to-recognize-base-on-base-patterns.htm) formation.

  

On Wednesday, the stock reclaimed its 10-week moving average line when it gapped up to close nearly 10% higher for the day and just below the 30.60 buy point. Volume came in 222% above average.

  

That pushed the Relative Strength line into new high ground, which is a bullish sign.

  

Silicon Motion followed that move by breaking out in early Thursday trading. The buying range is from 30.60 to 32.13.

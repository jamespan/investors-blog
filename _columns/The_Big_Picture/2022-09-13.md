Sellers hit the stock market hard Tuesday after the latest reading on consumer prices went the wrong way, awaking the bears from a four-session slumber.




A low-volume rally for the stock market was stopped in its tracks on news that the [consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-sliding-but-this-is-what-matters-for-the-fed-and-dow-jones/) edged up 0.1% in August compared to July. That doesn't sound like much but economists expected a decline of 0.1%. Year over year, consumer prices were up 8.3%, above the consensus for a gain of 8.1%.


The core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.6% month over month, double the consensus for a gain of 0.3%. Year over year, core prices increased 6.3%, slightly ahead of the 6.1% consensus.


Bond yields jumped on the news. The 10-year Treasury yield added 5 basis points to 3.41%, but the two-year yield vaulted 17 basis points to 3.74%. Before the data, the market was already expecting the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at the Sept. 21 meeting. Now, the chances for a 100-basis-point hike next week stand at 32%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


All three major stock indexes gapped below their 50-day moving averages, bringing a trip to their Sept. 6 lows into play.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP091322.jpg)


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.9%, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks like **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Apple's weakness came after the stock surged above its 200-day moving average Monday, helped by positive analyst chatter about iPhone 14 demand.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gave back 3.9%.


After four straight low-volume gains for the Nasdaq composite, the index slumped 5.2% in higher volume, resulting in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Declining stocks beat advancers by nearly 4-1.


The S&P 500 also suffered a distribution day, plunging 4.3% in higher volume. Losers dominated winners by nearly 8-to-1.


For the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, it was the steepest one-day decline since June 11, 2020, according to Dow Jones data.


Marker Movers
-------------


Agriculture stocks like **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)),Â  **Corteva** ([CTVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTVA)) and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) bucked the trend in the S&P 500. Oracle outperformed early after reporting a [strong quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/orcl-stock-wavers-on-quarterly-earnings/) late Monday. But a 3% intraday gain faded to a loss of 1.3% by the close as the stock got turned away at its 200-day moving average.


Corteva, a provider of seed and crop protection solutions, closed off highs but still rose 0.9%. In a challenging environment for technical breakouts, Corteva ended just below a 63.87 cup-with-handle buy point.


Albemarle reversed higher and hit an all-time high, but early gains faded. Shares edged higher by 0.4%. Fertilizer stock CF Industries added 0.7% as it holds support at the 50-day line.


Headed into Tuesday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had elevated distribution day counts with five each.

IBD put the stock market uptrend under pressure on Aug. 26. That was a signal for growth investors to start taking some money off the table, either by trimming some strong performers or selling laggard stocks outright. It's still good strategy with major stock indexes in an ugly distribution phase.


It's best to stay out of the market's way at this point. Assess your current holdings. If you've got some names that are profitable and holding above short-term support levels, it's OK to hold. In the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) portfolio, for example, we're still holding **Invesco Solar** ([TAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAN)) because it's slightly above our entry and holding above its converged 10- and 21-day lines.


Cheniere Energy Jumps
---------------------


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) outperformed thanks to bullish guidance late Monday. The company raised its full-year EBIDTA guidance to $11 billion to $11.5 billion, well above prior guidance of $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion. The [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock also increased its share buyback program by $4 billion and hiked its dividend 20%.



In the financial sector, **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)) showed relative strength. After falling 2.6% intraday, the investment advisor closed with a loss of just 0.2%. It's still holding above short-term support levels with outstanding fundamentals and a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/) in new high ground.


Solar leader **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) also closed off lows after a test of its 21-day exponential moving average. Shares eased 1.1%. Another leader in the group, **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)), edged lower and held support at its 10-day moving average.

========================================================

Major averages succumbed to more selling Monday as Wall Street braced for the start of first-quarter earnings season.

  

The Nasdaq lost 1.2%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.1%.

  

The Nasdaq fell further below its 50-day moving average and now stands 6% off its recent high.

  

The tech-laden index had been showing support at its 100-day moving average since June. The average had marked the Nasdaq's lows, but the composite has closed below that level for two straight sessions.

  

Volume was mixed Monday — coming in close to Friday's levels — but that was cold comfort for investors waiting for the selling in growth stocks to abate. On that front, it was another ugly session.

  

The IBD 50 gave up 2%. Since March 7, the index is down just over 11%, compared to a 5.9% drop for the Nasdaq and 1.8% decline for the S&P 500.

  

The market has given plenty of head fakes in recent weeks. When it seemed like major averages were headed for a meaningful pullback due to a high distribution day count, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showed resilience, never falling far off highs.

  

This time around, though, the damage in leading growth stocks is more severe. Not only have several market leaders given up their 50-day moving averages, but some are threatening breaks below their 200-day lines.

  

Such price action says that several growth names are ready to build new bases after lengthy run-ups. At this point, it's best to watch the process play out from the sidelines.

  

**Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) slumped 6% in heavy volume as institutional selling in the stock continued. It closed a hair above its 200-day moving average. So far, Qihoo has corrected 32% off its recent high. Keep in mind, a proper base generally should not correct more than 30% to 35%.

  

**Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) pullback, on the other hand, has been more moderate. Shares bucked the market trend Monday, rising 0.4%. Facebook has corrected 21% off its recent high.

  

A major market correction tends to bring every last growth stock down with it. **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) was one of the last growth stocks left standing, but the stock slid below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, falling 7%.

  

Defensive industry groups such as beverages, tobacco, utilities and real estate investment trust (REIT) were among the day's top-10 performing groups, but their gains were muted.

  

In the REIT group, **Equity Residential** ([EQR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQR)) cleared a long base with a buy point of 59.51, but volume was light. Its annualized dividend yield is about 3%.

  

Earnings reports on the horizon include Dow component **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) on Tuesday. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) report Friday.

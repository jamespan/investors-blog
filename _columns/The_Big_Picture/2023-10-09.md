The stock market rally showed enough grit Monday to shake off worries over the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indexes closed higher across the board, a fact that undoubtedly will encourage the bulls.




The Nasdaq composite improved as the session wore on and eventually squeezed out a modest 0.4% gain. This was an encouraging upside reversal given it posted a follow-through day on Friday. The tech-heavy index now sits just 1.1% below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), though retaking the level will be a key test. It is now up nearly 30% for the year as it tries to retrace recent losses.


The S&P 500 fared even better as it rallied out of negative territory to rise 0.6%. It closed a hair under its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) but is 2% below its 50-day line. The benchmark index looks to be trending higher again and is now up more than 13% in 2023.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP100923-253x300.jpg)Volume was lower on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, perhaps no surprise given it was Columbus Day and that the bond markets were closed. Advancers outnumbered decliners by about 2-to-1 on the NYSE, but honors were even on the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a 0.6% lift and is now within striking distance of its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rule-no-21-use-200-day-line-to-spot-overheating/). **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) were the stars of the day on the much-watched index.


Small caps also gained, with the Russell 2000 climbing 0.6%. The index remains well below its 200-day line. Growth stocks did best of all, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) advancing 1%.


Fedspeak Emboldens Stock Market Bulls
-------------------------------------


Indexes opened lower as investors fled to safety following the weekend's attack on Israel by Hamas. The key U.S. ally was staging a robust response Monday and has called up 300,000 reservists.


Nevertheless, fears of the conflict escalating remain, with Israel's military spokesman saying the country is ready to take action if it faces attacks from Lebanon.


But stocks were buoyed after Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said that if long-term interest rates remain elevated because of higher-term premiums, "there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate."


But Logan did not strike a totally dovish tone. She added that the Federal Open Market Committee may still need to do more to tackle inflation. She spoke out ahead of Wednesday's release of the Fed minutes for September's meeting, which should offer some more clues on the direction central bankers see interest rates taking in the months ahead.


Energy, Defense Stocks Shine
----------------------------


S&P 500 [sectors all closed in positive territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Energy and industrials stood out while financials made the slimmest gains.



The relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered more of an insight into the best-performing issues in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


A variety of oil and gas groups, life insurance stocks and defense plays all shined. **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) was a top performer in the latter group as it smashed through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, turning in an 11.4% gain in the process. **General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)) and [Leaderboard Watchlist name](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)Â **Woodward** ([WWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWD)) also impressed.


On the other side of the coin, airline stocks, media periodicals, solar plays and consumer electronics companies all had sessions to forget.

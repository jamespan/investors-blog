The stock market recorded fresh all-time highs Friday, but the Nasdaq composite snapped an 11-day win streak after reversing lower. The Nasdaq gained as much as 0.3% before closing with a nearly 0.2% loss.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose almost 0.1%; the S&P 500 was unchanged. All three major indexes hit all-time highs. The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), one of numerous IBD screens of top growth stocks, fell more than 0.1% Friday. Volume was higher across both exchanges relative to Thursday's turnover.


Stock Market Reverses From Highs
--------------------------------


The stock market is certainly due for a breather. Since the lows on Dec. 3, the Nasdaq composite gained as much as 7.3% to Friday's peak price. The Nasdaq is up about 36% year to date, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials follow up with gains of 29% and 23%, respectively.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP12271919-261x300.jpg)The stock market's technicals improved vastly this week, as four total [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) fell off the count due to the stock market's hefty gains. The Nasdaq lost three distribution days. [On Monday,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rises-dow-leads-boeing-disney/) the Nov. 20 and the Dec. 3 distribution days fell off. [On Thursday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rally-nasdaq-tops-9000-apple-stock-record-high-shopify-oled-break-out/), the Dec. 2 day dropped off. Lastly, the S&P 500's Dec. 3 distribution day dropped off Friday after a 5% gain from 3093.20 (the S&P 500's closing price on Dec. 3). [Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) are signs of institutional selling.


Keep in mind that investors' complacency — as measured by the put/call ratio — is at a key inflection point. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) recently fell below 0.6. A level of 0.6 or lower is considered a warning sign, indicating overconfidence among investors.


Top Stocks To Watch: Amazon, Netflix, Spotify Set Up
----------------------------------------------------



Top stocks to watch in the current stock market include FANG stock leaders **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Both are approaching [new buy points.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)


E-commerce giant Amazon tried to follow through on Thursday's 4.5% advance, rising as much as 1.7% to 1,901.40 before paring gains to 0.1%. Amazon stock is moving up the right side of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 2,035.90 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

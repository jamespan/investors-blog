Stocks Quiet, But Does Weekly Chart Hint At Trouble?
=====================================================

Dayside volume got an early start on "Silent Night" on Friday, but the market bungled the lyrics.


All was calm in the indexes, but very little was bright.


The Nasdaq added 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1% each. Small caps outperformed, with the S&P 600 rising 0.5%.


Volume was near silent on both major exchanges, which is normal in the run-up to a three-day weekend.

The week concluded with an interesting development on the charts of the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


If the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were individual stocks, the action in the past three weeks would qualify as a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/). The pattern is bullish for an individual stock that clears the pattern in strong volume.


If the Nasdaq should thrust higher in convincing volume, no bull would object.


![mp122316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122316-229x300.png)But there's no guarantee that the next move will be up.


For example, the Nasdaq sketched similar action on the weekly chart Oct. 7, Aug. 19 and Dec. 4, 2015.


In each case, pullbacks followed. The declines were about 18%, 5% and 6%.


For the Nasdaq, the tight trade in the index appears to be more often about a stalled uptrend than a bullish signal. The Market Pulse downshifted to either correction or pressure in two to five days in the three previous cases.


Taking some profits here might be a prudent. If the stalling turns out to be just a pause before the next thrust up, the individual investor can always check the watchlist for a new buy.


A pullback of 5% to 6% in the indexes would probably not define much on the individual stock charts.


Cagey bulls might find themselves hoping for a sharper correction. This could lead to a broader reset, eventually offering better bases and more breakouts.


In economic news Friday, new-home sales for November topped the Street's consensus estimate by 2%. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge rose to 98.2, beating views for 98.


For the week, the Nasdaq and the Dow each added 0.5%; the S&P 600, 0.4%; and the S&P 500, 0.3%.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, carmakers and construction machinery makers led for the week. Each advanced 4%, according to preliminary data. Banks and cement also had a good week.


On the downside, newspapers slouched 7% lower. Retail groups also had a bum week.

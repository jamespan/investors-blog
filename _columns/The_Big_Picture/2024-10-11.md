Fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres face a nail-biter of a Game 5 on Friday evening to determine who will face the red-hot New York Mets in the Major League Baseball playoffs. But on Wall Street, stock market bulls seemed to show no signs of nervousness.




In a solid week for equity investors, the stock market finished on a strong note Friday. News of cooler inflation and a few big banks' earnings deserved credit.


The Nasdaq composite rose mildly Friday, yet its 0.3% gain padded the tech-heavy index's recent advance. At 18,342, the tech-fortified index chalked up its highest close since July 16.


The Nasdaq now stands less than 1.8% away from its all-time peak of 18,671.


The S&P 500 firmed up 0.6% for its fourth gain in six sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average blasted nearly 1% higher to 42,863.


Both indexes etched all-time highs.


Stock Market: Indexes On Five-Week Rally
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP101124.jpg)For the week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both gained 1.1%. Each index posted a fifth straight weekly rise. The 30-stock Dow industrials raced 1.2% higher and also punched out a fifth consecutive weekly gain.


The longest win streak in recent years? A nine-week run through the week ended Dec. 29, 2023, in which the Dow rallied 16%. Currently 12 of the Dow 30 stocks boast a Relative Strength Rating of 80 or higher.


U.S. Producer Price Index data showed mixed surprises. Yet inflation overall continued to revert closer to the Federal Reserve's long-range target of 2%. The stock market seemed to dismiss a higher-than-expected 1.8% increase year over year in wholesale prices for September. [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) expected a 1.6% rise.


Any reacceleration in prices would not be welcomed by investors. Core producer level prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items, rose 2%, well below economist forecasts for a 2.7% gain.


The Russell 2000 coasted 2.1% higher Friday, raising its weekly gain to 1%. That snapped a mild two-week slide, and the Russell recouped all of that two-week loss and more. Still, as seen on a weekly chart, the Russell 2000's relative strength line continues to fall. This means it's lagging large caps.


Watch The AI Sector
-------------------


**Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) beat the stock market indexes, rallying 15% for the week. It tested resistance at the 10-week moving average, which has plunged from around 84.50 two months ago to 47.99 currently.



William O'Neil, founder of Investor's Business Daily, was not a big proponent of selling stocks short. But an opportunity to make money selling stocks short occasionally arises in two ways.


One, the entire stock market goes into bearish mode. Two, a super winner has clearly topped and runs into severe selling resistance at key technical levels, such as the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on a daily chart and the 10-week line on the weekly.


Earnings Momentum Boosts Stock Market
-------------------------------------



**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), a member of the Dow industrials, surged 5.2% for the week on quarterly results. Revenue grew 7% and the money center actively bought back shares.


Money manager **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) rallied 4.3% for the week and made further progress past a flat-base breakout at 845. BlackRock soundly beat quarterly earnings views and grew its assets under management.


Meanwhile, data from **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) noted that the front end of the Treasury bond yield curve is moving closer to achieving a positive slope again, and that would benefit lenders. The 10-year bond yield cooled off two basis points Friday to 4.07%.


Headed into Friday's session, Tradeweb ranked No. 5 in the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


**Some Commodities Are Soaring In October**
-------------------------------------------


Beyond the stock market, some commodities continued hot runs in October.


For instance, the front-month crude oil contract for November delivery added 1.6% this past week to close at $75.56 a barrel on the Nymex, according to Dow Jones Data. Oil is still off nearly 15.5% from its 52-week high of $89.37 marked on Oct. 19 last year. But in October this year, crude has flown 10.8% for the month so far.


Gold futures on the Comex exchange for October delivery added nearly 0.5% for the week to $2,657.60 per ounce, Dow Jones Data reported. Not only did gold rise for a fifth consecutive week, but the shiny metal netted its longest winning streak since the week ended April 19.


Gold is now up 28.9% year to date.



The weekly chart shows a terrific run for SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) since the exchange traded fund crossed a 193.18 buy point in a nearly nine-week base in the week ended March 1 this year. Notice how GLD tried to break out of a five-week base in late May, then ran into a wall of selling. But it spent just five weeks below the 10-week moving average, then rebounded en route to new highs.


However, amid ample supplies of natural gas, Nymex futures for November delivery continued to fare poorly. Down 7.8% for the week to $2.63 per million BTUs, natural gas has fallen 10% for the month. Its gain in 2024 is 4.7%.


Ned Davis Research boosted its stance on energy-related equities to overweight from neutral, citing an oversold situation.


Will lower energy prices help U.S. consumers this holiday shopping season? NerdWallet noted in comments emailed to IBD that Americans have plans to spend $17 billion more on gifts this holiday season vs. the $184 billion it estimated was spent in 2023.

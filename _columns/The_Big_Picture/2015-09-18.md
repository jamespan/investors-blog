Stock Indexes Go Nowhere But Down; Fed Can't Shake Off The Gloom
=================================================================

Stocks posted big losses Friday, unable to gain any traction the day after the Fed's decision to hold rates at near zero. The Nasdaq slashed off 1.4%, the S&P 500 1.6% and the Dow 1.7%. The IBD 50 lost 1%. 

  

Volume rose across the board, thanks to options and futures expirations.

  

The stock market suffered distribution for the third time in the past eight days. Distribution bunched together is more of a threat than distribution days spread over four or five weeks.

  

In this pressured climate, individual investors should maintain a cautious stance. Although an uptrend under pressure is still an uptrend, the downward sloping 50-day lines on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are bad signs.

  

The indexes have rebounded nicely off their Aug. 24 lows but are still under the 50-day lines.

  

During the week, the Fed's rate decision dominated the focus and overshadowed market technicals.

  

Although the Federal Reserve's near-zero rate policy appeared to be what the market wanted in the past, the reaction this time was negative. Some market watchers say the Fed only succeeded in signaling a lack of confidence in the economy.

  

Roughly 80 months of low rates don't appear to have provided much stimulus. Instead, a sluggish U.S. economy combined with the low rates made share buybacks the best bet in town.

  

In a healthy economy, companies put money into expansion projects, which leads to more employment and prosperity. The business climate hasn't been right for that in years.

  

Still, there are always winners and losers in the stock market.

  

Utilities and real estate investment trusts did well in the past two sessions. The big dividends look tall next to the alternatives.

  

On the downside, banks fell on the rate news. Super regional banks fell 5% over the past two sessions. Higher rates would give banks more to work with.

  

Big name money centers also suffered dents. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) each lost about 5% over the two days.

  

Apart from corporate buybacks, bulls are having a hard time imagining a catalyst that could drive this market higher.

  

When a catalyst is found, it might not be clear at first. That's why individual investors should monitor the price and volume action of the indexes.

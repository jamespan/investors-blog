The stock market sold off after the major stock indexes reversed from big gains, as the correction deepened and indexes fell below some more significant benchmarks.




After the stock market close, FANG stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and medical leader **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) reported their quarterly earnings results, and both sold off in extended trading.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9%, while the S&P 500 moved down 1.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced as much as 2.1% before closing with a 1.3% loss. The small-cap Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9%. All four indexes closed at sessions lows and below some key levels.


The Dow closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Dec. 1. The S&P 500 undercut its December low. The Nasdaq undercut its October low and tumbled further below its 200-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP012022-300x297.jpg)Rising yields are among the factors hurting stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield inched above 1.83%. On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit a two-year high, topping out above 1.87% before closing below 1.83%.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 2.1%. The ETF of top growth stocks extended a losing streak to three sessions and is nearly 9% down for the week.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but appeared to be slightly lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


With the [stock market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) in a correction, investors should mostly, if not entirely, be on the sidelines and in cash. Avoid making new purchases and prepare for the next uptrend by building your watchlist with stocks that have strong relative strength lines and sound fundamentals.


For now, investors are still waiting for an elusive Day 1 of a new rally attempt — the first day off index lows. Then, be on the lookout for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), which is when a major index posts strong gains in volume heavier than the prior day. Follow-throughs occur as early as Day 4 of the attempted rally.

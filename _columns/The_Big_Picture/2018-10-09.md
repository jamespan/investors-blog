  Small Caps, Growth Stocks Slump Again As These Sectors Flex More Strength

The market failed to rebound with vigor on Tuesday, but the Nasdaq composite technically halted a three-day selling streak. Small caps underperformed. Top stocks mostly struggled.




When an IBD reader sees tiny changes by the major indexes for the day, the analysis should not stop there. Tuesday's trading session hinted at a change in the parade of money flowing on Wall Street.


For months, software, business services and retail sectors simply dominated. You could see that in IBD's rankings of 33 broad sectors in the research tables of Nasdaq and NYSE stocks.


However, business software stocks have taken a pretty hard hit lately. (Just take a look at the [current ranks within the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).) Expect the best companies to try to slow their slides. At the very least, some will form brand-new bases.

The Nasdaq has now given up support at the 50-day moving average and fallen as much as 5.9% from its all-time peak. Meanwhile, some oil and gas, railroad and health care companies are trying to elbow into the leadership ranks.


**CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)), new [Sector Leaders stock list member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) and Medicaid plan provider **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), highlighted on Monday in the [new feature IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), have started out fairly well in the new quarter.


That's actually good for the market's long-term health. Sector rotation helps keep a bull run going.


A Seesaw Session
----------------


The Nasdaq composite eked out a gain of just 2 points after sinking 288 points in the prior three sessions. The S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower in a mostly seesaw session. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Since the loss by the S&P 500 was tiny, it narrowly avoided a fresh distribution day. (The Nasdaq's Sept. 4 distribution day was removed because of time.)


Small caps and many leading stocks fared worse. The small-cap S&P 600 fell 0.4%, marking a fourth straight decline. At 1015, the index has now corrected 7.7% from an Aug. 27 peak of 1100. This marks the second biggest sell-off for the S&P 600 in 2018, following a 10.5% bloodletting from Jan. 24 to Feb. 9.


Another sharp drop on the order of 1.5% and more, and the S&P 600 could make its first test of long-term support at the 200-day line since early February.


A Near Test Of The 200-Day Line
-------------------------------


The S&P MidCap 400 came within 3 to 4 points of doing just that on Tuesday after a 0.6% drop. Ditto for the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which slumped nearly 0.8% in turnover 31% higher than usual.


At 34.96, the exchange traded fund is now up just 5.3% year to date. It rallied 34% last year. The S&P 500, at 2880, holds a 7.7% gain since Jan. 1.


Market internals are certainly showing darker hues lately. On the Nasdaq, falling stocks topped winners by just a slim margin, roughly 8-to-7. However, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has now sloped lower for more than five weeks in a row. In other words, fewer stocks have been moving higher.


That makes it tougher for growth stock pickers to make money in brand-new buys.


Small Caps Hurt The Stock Market Internals
------------------------------------------


The NYSE's advance-decline line also peaked five weeks ago. Meanwhile, the total number of stocks making 52-week or all-time lows that passed IBD's screening criteria has surpassed new highs in 11 of the past 12 sessions, including Wednesday.


This means fewer stocks are positioning themselves for leadership with breakouts to 52-week or all-time highs.


Such market behavior is completely natural.


Wall Street is adjusting to a number of ever-changing scenarios. They include the sudden pole-vault in yields for the U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year note, the increasing murkiness of the Chinese economy amid a tariff dispute that is not improving, and the relatively high level of optimism among newsletter editors [polled weekly by Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears).


Last week, the bullish ratio climbed to 61.8%, the highest level since early February. Expectations of further market gains are quite high. But the market likes to fool the crowd. Just when practically everyone thinks the market will go a certain direction, stocks take the opposite path.


Meanwhile, negative surprises or outlooks by companies usually result in price corrections in any industry. On Tuesday, **PPG Industries** ([PPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPG)) announced that it's seeing higher costs and slowing demand. The giant in coatings, glass and chemicals for numerous markets gapped down hard, falling 10% to 98.56 in the highest volume for a single session since March 2017.


The market faces uncertainty over the outlook on future earnings. The Street already expects a strong double-digit rise in earnings per share among S&P 500 firms. But rising rates and the trade war seem to make it a real challenge for high-growth companies to overdeliver.


Plus, many strategists see a deceleration in overall growth as the positive effects of the Trump tax cuts fade over time.


One Silver Lining
-----------------


The plus side of the market? Some sectors are still doing pretty well.


In the latest IBD Weekly, IBD's U.S. Defense Index showed a year-to-date gain of 14.3%.Â **Huntington Ingalls** ([HII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HII)), **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) and other defense stocks showed decent price action in the third quarter.


Some traders feared another big spike in long-term Treasury yields on Tuesday, one day after the Columbus Day holiday. Instead, buying returned and the benchmark 10-year note showed a 2-basis-point drop in yield to 3.21%.

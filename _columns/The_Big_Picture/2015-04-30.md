Sellers got out the big knives Thursday as the indexes lost chunks and leading stocks were slashed.

  

The Nasdaq dropped for a fourth session in a row, lopping off 1.6%. The S&P 500 sliced off 1%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 axed 2.2%.

  

The IBD 50 carved off 2%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The action slapped the Nasdaq and S&P 500 with distribution days, even as the March 25 distribution day fell off the count.

  

Distribution involves a significant loss in a major index in rising volume. Such action points to institutional selling.

  

Both major indexes closed under their 50-day lines, and IBD's market outlook switched to uptrend under pressure.

  

The Market Pulse, at right, understates Thursday's pain. Only stocks moving in double their usual volume or more are listed. There were too many to list otherwise.

  

Among top-rated stocks, the damage over the past few days has been selectively vicious.

  

On Monday, **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) dived 22%. On Tuesday, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) chopped off 18%. On Wednesday, **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) swooned 9%. On Thursday, **Harman International** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)) slammed 7% lower; **On Assignment** ([ASGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASGN)) 11%; and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) 2% in the regular session and more than 20% in after-hours trade following a weak outlook.

  

With the exception of Akorn's slide on news of a restatement, the damage came on quarterly results. Extreme reactions can be unnerving, even to people who don't own the stocks.

  

Witnessing a one-day loss of 10% or 20% can make investors wonder what kind of market they are in. In this pressured environment, keeping plenty of cash on the sidelines is prudent.

  

Meanwhile, some sector rotation could be underway.

  

The market-leading biotechs are starting to leave ugly marks on the charts. The biotech industry group has dived 10% so far this week.

  

Where is the money going?

  

A look at the industry groups while biotechs have been falling shows big ups mostly in oil stocks, then less so in mining and construction â€” with a smattering in software security and apparel-shoes.

  

Generally, it looks like some fund money is coming back into the low-rated oil stocks as crude prices rise and settle.

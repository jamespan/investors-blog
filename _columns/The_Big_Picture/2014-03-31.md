Stocks put in a rally Monday and closed out the first quarter of 2014 with modest gains.


The Nasdaq climbed 1% and neared its 50-day moving average, where it faces a test of resistance. The tech-heavy index was up as much as 1.4%. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%. It's only about 11 points off its March 21 record high and has erased last week's 0.5% loss.


The Dow Jones industrial average also rose 0.8%. Small-cap stocks outperformed, as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.8% and regained its 50-day line. The IBD 50 rallied 1.5%.


Reassurances from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen that the easy-money policy will continue ([see story on Page A1](http://news.investors.com/economy/033114-695309-yellen-pledges-more-economic-support.htm)), along with stimulus hopes in the eurozone and China helped stocks to a second straight gain Monday.


The major indexes held onto the bulk of the day's gains, unlike the prior three sessions, when Nasdaq gains faded into the close.


Breadth was solid in the market Monday, with winners topping losers by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Volume ended higher across the board. Trading was tracking lower for most of Monday's session, but ultimately finished higher. Turnover spiked in the final hour, likely due to window dressing â€” when fund managers sell losers and buy recent market winners to make their portfolios look better.


The major indexes ended the first quarter with gains, as the S&P 500 climbed 1.3% and the Nasdaq 0.5%. For March, the S&P 500 grabbed a 0.7% gain, while the Nasdaq slumped 2.5%.


Software, Internet and biotech were some of the worst-performing industry groups for the month.


Many leading stocks rose along with the general market Monday. In the IBD 50, 46 issues rose. **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)), **WuXi Pharmatech** ([WX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WX)) and **Avis Budget Group** ([CAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAR)) climbed 4% to 7%. But all had below-average volume.


On the contrary, **HollySys Automation Technologies** ([HOLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLI)) jumped 5% to a record high in heavy trading. It's now 10% past a 19.53 buy point from a cup base.


**KapStone Paper & Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) also rose in higher volume, but remains below its 50-day line. The stock slumped more than 8% below a 29.26 buy point from a flat base last week.


Even though Monday's action was a step in the right direction, the market is still in a correction.


The focus should be on defense and not on new buys.


Protecting hard-earned gains is key. Sell any stocks down 7% or 8% from your purchase price. On winning trades, watch out for any stocks threatening to erase gains after rising more than 10%.


During a correction, continue to pay attention to the market and see which industry groups and individual stocks are holding up better than others.


This is also the time to work on your watch list. Always be ready with top-notch names to buy when a new market uptrend emerges.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a day of volatile trading in the red Monday as the S&P 500 hit bear territory in intraday trades then bounced off those levels as frantic investors tried to weigh President Donald Trump's ever-evolving tariff plans. Meanwhile the Cboe volatility index hit an eight-month high in [Monday's stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Needless to say, it was a day of high volatility, proving that investors feared tariffs would hurt corporate balance sheets just as earnings season kicks into gear.




But somehow **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reversed higher and broke a two-day losing streak. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), however, fell on analyst price target downgrades.


Here's how it went down: The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,600 points at the opening bell Monday but swung violently, jumping nearly 600 points ahead before falling again. Blue chips finished the day 0.9% lower — just shy of a 350-point loss.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 swayed by more than 400 points before finishing the day down 0.2%. The Nasdaq was no exception, as its price range spanned nearly 700 points, yet it managed to finish the day in positive territory with a 0.1% gain. The tech-dominated index also ended in the upper half of its [true range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/average-true-range-growth-stocks-analysis/) Monday.


Has The Stock Market Hit A Bottom?
----------------------------------


But the jury is still out on whether the stock market has put in a bottom. As long as indexes remain below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), risks abound. Tariff wars and upcoming earnings compound those risks and it is best to proceed with utmost caution.

One good indicator is the fear gauge, as the Cboe volatility index spiked to an eight-month high on Monday before retreating. The last time the gauge hit those levels was on Aug. 5 when the Nasdaq fell to its 200-day moving average before rebounding.


Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was lower, but higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time on Friday. Advancers lagged decliners by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE and 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Small caps on the Russell 2000 outperformed in the early going, rising 2.6%, but fell 0.9% at the closing bell. The index remains in bear territory after its 9.7% drop last week. Simply put, growth stocks continued to lag.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund dipped 0.9% on Monday. Among the S&P sectors, technology and communication services outperformed while others fell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.15%.


Up Next: Now Comes Earnings Season
----------------------------------


Earnings season kicks off this week with **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) reporting their first-quarter earnings on Friday.


Inflation data for March could move stocks on Thursday with more economic news due on Friday when the labor department is expected to release the producer's price index data. Inflation is seen cooling off to a 0.1% increase from February's 0.2%, and to 2.6% from 2.8% on an annual basis while economists expect the PPI index also to increase 0.2% month-on-month.


Also on Friday, the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment is expected to come in at 55 for April, down from 57 in March.


Monday's Gainers; Why Apple Fell
--------------------------------


**AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) and **Grail** ([GRAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRAL)) were among Monday's gainers on the Nasdaq as shares of both stocks rebounded from their 200-day moving averages. **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) were the best performers in the S&P 500.



Positive news was to be found among some quantum stocks. **Rigetti** ([RGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGTI)) and **IonQ** ([IONQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IONQ)) rose on Monday after news that the Department of Defense had selected the two companies among 15 others to test if quantum computing could reach "utility-scale operation" by 2033.


Elsewhere, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) reversed higher. They were Monday's additions to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) pared early losses and led the Dow with a 3.5% gain. Among other Magnificent Seven stocks in the Dow, **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Meta** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) ended higher.


Among the losers was **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which fell 2.6% after it got a [price target downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-price-target-slashed-43-trump-tariffs-apple-pt-sliced-23/) to 315 from 550. Shares remain below their [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Meanwhile, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) plummeted 3.7% amid fears the iPhone maker may be at high risk from President Trump's tariffs. Roughly [90% of iPhones are made and assembled in China](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-stung-trump-tariff-armageddon/), prompting Wedbush analyst Dan Ives to slash his price target to 250 from 325 while maintaining an outperform rating.

The stock market finished lower Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit fresh 2022 lows after **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) reported weak guidance. Thursday's losses further heightened the negative sentiment in an already-struggling stock market rally.




The 10-year Treasury yield closed at 2.85%, falling seven of the last nine trading days. Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield traded as high as 3.16%, its highest level since November 2018.


Early Thursday, a disappointing reading in the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for May and higher-than-expected initial jobless claims sent the indexes lower at the market open.


On the earnings front, Cisco led the declines among Dow Jones stocks, plunging nearly 14% on a [disappointing earnings outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/csco-stock-cisco-earnings-fiscalq32022/). **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)), **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) and **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) were also earnings movers. BJ's shares jumped more than 7%. Kohl's reversed higher more than 4% even after [saying its first-quarter sales dropped 5.2%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kohls-first-quarter-sales-fall-as-retailers-struggle-with-inflation-11652964306) as it struggles with inflation. [Synopsys stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snps-stock-synopsys-easily-tops-quarterly-sales-earnings-targets/) surged more than 10%.


Struggling Stock Market Rally
-----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared losses to 0.8% Thursday, but still hit a fresh 2022 low. The S&P 500 trimmed its loss to 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 inched higher.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP051922-274x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq, adding [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) to the index. The Nasdaq received its first day of institutional selling. NYSE volume rose modestly, which gave the S&P 500 its second distribution day.


The S&P sectors finished mostly lower, with consumer staples and technology falling 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively. Materials was the best performer, gaining 0.7%.


Growth stocks ended slightly lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) declined 0.2%. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **New Fortress Energy** ([NFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFE)) rose 1.1%. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock is building a consolidation with a 49.40 buy point, as it holds above its 50-day moving average.


On Tuesday, the stock market trend was upgraded from a "market in correction" to "confirmed uptrend" after the [session's powerful follow-through.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-this-positive-turn-5-keys-to-a-vigorous-rebound/) Just one day later, the [stock market's dive](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-mauled-as-bears-pounce-amid-these-fears-retail-savaged-on-target-earnings/) placed the nascent uptrend under pressure.


Although the underlying uptrend remains intact, it is time to play defense and maintain a cautious stance. Be careful about new purchases by focusing on the stocks with the best fundamentals and price action. To be sure, there are few good setups among leading stocks.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO))'s recent action underscores the danger in the current stock market. On Tuesday, AVGO shares jumped more than 4% to retake the 50-day moving average and break out past a [downward-sloping trend line](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=8bdbfceb6bdf520ab36887e27160621282bbb0669bfa92580c93c5d2600b45d7dfc017824c8fcc75187f187f8273ef982d7ca772aa8e9d9193b4f6857d57bdb7), which triggered an early [buy signal](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=8bdbfceb6bdf520a83c6eee9653474ad0fea2dccc0000f14c6d0c1ff45c949785469cf186fb8e0f06f8c23972fa4942dcddea027b6e9638b8806e47136bee017). One day later, however, the stock dived more than 6% to break down through the 50-day line. On Thursday, the stock broke its long-term 200-day line, falling more than 4%.

WWE A Market Leader To Watch
----------------------------



If the market were to continue its uptrend, **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)), for example, is one of the top stocks to watch after closing Thursday right above its 50-day line. A decisive retake of this level would be bullish for the stock's immediate prospects. WWE shares are forming a flat base with a 63.81 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [WWE stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-world-wrestling-entmnt-wwe.aspx) shows a solid 96 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Meanwhile, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit more new highs this week. WWE is featured in this week's [The New America](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/wwe-stock-stays-firm-gets-ready-to-rumble/) and is on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist.


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock and Dow Jones leader **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) continues to act well in the wake of a recent breakout. Shares are the 5% buy area past a 89.58 buy point. The buy zone goes up to 94.06.


Remember that the current market conditions aren't particularly conducive to new purchases, so be more cautious until the market gives better signals.

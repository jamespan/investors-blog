Did the action in [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) feel a bit twitchy?




Judging by the relatively mild closes among various key indexes, some might agree. Yet most would nod at the assertion that earnings season can make even the most veteran investor a little anxious.


And big drops after the closing bell in stocks today by **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) — which [dived sharply on its weaker-than-expected outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-slides-despite-q1-earnings-sales-beat/) — and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) offer the latest proof.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq outperformed other benchmarks. But surely its 0.3% rise wasn't much to crow about. The composite index's intraday range extended 1.3% from low to high; at the session high of 15,838, the Nasdaq advanced as much as 0.9%. The Nasdaq 100 closed 0.3% higher. In contrast, the S&P 500 closed the session up 1 point. The Russell 2000 sank 0.4% despite a generally positive session for regional banking stocks today.


The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) exchange traded fund rose 0.6%. **Synchrony Financial** ([SYF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYF)), highlighted in the accompanying Market Pulse, rallied 5% in the heaviest turnover in seven weeks.


The member of IBD's savings and loan industry group broke out of a nearly [six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 43.84 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) goes up to 46.03.


Stocks Today: Synchrony's Rare Breakout
---------------------------------------



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP042424-234x300.jpg)A [MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) shows Synchrony triggering the [relative strength line blue dot](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/winning-stocks-and-bullish-blue-dots/), which highlights true outperformance vs. the S&P 500 among stocks today.


On the downside, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1%. Midcap stocks traded flat. Again, these indexes posted mild finishes. Yet none of these moves compares with the 2.3% thrashing seen in the Dow Jones transportation average. **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) slid 11% to 195.06. Volume surged 255% above its 50-day moving average, making Wednesday's session the heaviest trading day in 2024 so far. It was the [latest blow for trucking stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/trucking-companies-jbhunt-saia-odfl-stock-earnings/).


Old Dominion reported a 4% rise in earnings to $1.34 a share on a 1% sales increase to $1.46 billion. The company's fundamentals have stayed muted for four quarters in a row.


In a news release, CEO Marty Freeman remarked that the company's financial results improved "despite continued softness in the domestic economy." Old Dominion also saw a 3.2% decline in LTL (less than truckload) tons of shipments per day that "reflects a 2.7% decrease in LTL weight per shipment and a 0.5% decrease in LTL shipments per day."


The stock hadn't exactly gotten thrown under the bus by investors. Since crossing a trendline buy point near 72 during the week ended May 1, 2020, Old Dominion has traversed 216% higher. However, shares on Wednesday slid below the key [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


For now, the outlook for stocks today remains in a highly vulnerable state. And big waves of quarterly results over the next several weeks might lead to even more challenging trading conditions.


All in all, the rebound has not shown a lot of oomph since Friday, when IBD counted a 10th [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) over a 25-day time frame on the S&P 500 and determined that the correct amount of exposure in stocks today sits between zero and 20%.


Only four days earlier, on April 15, the recommended exposure sat at 20%-40%, which is obviously low. One day before that, on April 12, the suggested level stood at 40%-60%.


Elsewhere, the yield on the key 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 5 basis points to 4.65%, according to Cboe data. The yield in this symbolic cost of money has hovered between 4.56% and 4.69% over the past seven trading sessions.

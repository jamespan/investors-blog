The stock market dived Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell's comments reignited inflation fears.




Wall Street opened lower amid rising concerns about the omicron Covid variant. But the stock market had been paring losses until Powell's midday comments to the Senate Banking Committee, which sent key indexes sharply lower.


"At this point the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high and it is therefore appropriate, in my view, to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at the November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner, and I expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting in a couple of weeks," Powell said.


He also said it is "probably a good time to retire" the term "transitory" when referring to inflation.

His comments sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average diving as many as 711 points intraday before finishing off 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite reversed from a small gain to a 1.6% loss. The S&P 500 lost 1.9%. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain above their 50-day moving average.


The two indexes added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), thanks to higher volume. The Nasdaq now has logged three days over a 25-trading-day period, while the S&P 500's count swelled to six. But not all six days are serious cases of institutional selling in the current stock market uptrend. The S&P 500 sank 2.3% on Nov. 26, and gave up 0.8% on Nov. 10. Until today, the rest were dips of 0.5% or less.


Still, with the distribution day count rising, the market outlook has downshifted to [uptrend under pressure](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/action-plans/). During Tuesday's session, the Nasdaq fell below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and undercut Friday's low, a bearish sign.


Sell-Off Hits Stock Market Broadly
----------------------------------


There were few places to hide in the stock market. All 11 S&P sectors suffered losses, with communication services, utilities, consumer staples, industrials and energy each down more than 2.5%. Crude oil prices slumped more than 4% to $66.94 a barrel, as omicron fears spread to travel-related stocks.



The technology sector performed best, down less than 1%.


Among big-cap techs, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) led the Dow with a 3.2% gain in heavy trade to a new closing high. AAPL stock is now extended from a 153.27 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares rallied amid news that Apple is China's top smartphone maker, based on November sales.


But over in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **ZoomInfo Technologies** ([ZI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZI)) dived 12%. Other big losers included **Confluent** ([CFLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFLT)), **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)), down more than 6% each.


**Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) pared its loss to 4% by the close. Shares dropped early Tuesday, after CEO Stephane Bancel said in a [Financial Times interview](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f) that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new omicron variant. But the stock closed near session highs and remains above its 50-day line.


What To Do Now
--------------



With the market uptrend now under pressure, it's crucial to heed all sell rules — on the upside and downside.


Don't hesitate to lock in gains if your winners reach the [20%-25% profit-taking goal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/). Now is not the time to let it ride and hope for the best.


Review all downside sell rules, such as a sharp breach in heavy volume of the [50-day line or the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/). ZoomInfo's action Tuesday showed a stark change in character as the stock tumbled well below its 50-day line in huge trade.


It also triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) as ZoomInfo fell 9% below a 67.73 buy point of a [prior flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/).


Last week, the stock also tripped the [round-trip sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/) by erasing its double-digit gain from the entry. So it had already flashed a warning before Tuesday's big drop.



On a positive note, two IBD 50 stocks showed strong action on Tuesday.


China electric-vehicle maker **XPeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) surged 7% in fast turnover to a 10-month high. **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)) rallied more than 6% in huge volume to a new closing high. Both stocks are well-extended from recent breakouts.

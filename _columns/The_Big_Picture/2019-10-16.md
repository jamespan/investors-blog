Stock market bulls were generally in a good mood for a third straight session Wednesday despite another sell-off in software stocks. Meanwhile, a weak reading onÂ [September retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-unexpectedly-fell-september-2019-dow-jones-slips/) raised the chances of another quarter-point rate hike at the Oct. 31 Federal Reserve meeting.




The Nasdaq marked a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), falling 0.3% in slightly higher volume. Still, it was a resilient performance considering that IBD's enterprise software group slumped more than 4%. Sentiment was negative in the sector after Morgan Stanley suggested that a recent pullback in software stocks could have more to go.


Selling was also muted in the Dow Jones and S&P 500 as both indexes fell 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. Small caps hung in there, with the Russell 2000 up 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE appeared to be lower than Tuesday's level.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP_7x7_101619-238x300.jpg)Before the [retail sales data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-unexpectedly-fell-september-2019-dow-jones-slips/), the chances were around 76% for an interest-rate cut later this month. But the chances rose to 87% after the data. Futures traders aren't so sure about an additional quarter-point cut in December, with the chances recently around 23%.


Stock Market Today: Retailers Pack Punch
----------------------------------------


The weak economic data didn't have much impact on leading retail stocks in the stock market today as [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) and **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) outperformed. Burlington Stores is working on a well-formed [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 209.46 entry. Costco was resilient despite a downgrade from Northcoast Research to neutral from buy.



Price action in the stock market this week has been mostly positive after a weak close Friday raised some eyebrows. The Nasdaq gapped up Friday and rose as much as 2%, but the gain faded to 1.3% by the close as heavy-volume selling during the final hour of trading marred an otherwise bullish session. But the selling didn't spill over into Monday, as major stock indexes ended with tiny losses. And Tuesday's bullish gains put the [stock market back in a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-surprising-gains-market-outlook-shifts/).


Stock Market Movers: Software Stocks Hit
----------------------------------------


The software sector got hit with another round of institutional selling Wednesday, hurt by [negative analyst commentary](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/software-stocks-fall-bearish-views-corporate-spending/). IShares Expanded Tech-Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) gapped below its 50-day moving average, falling 2.3%, after reclaiming the line Friday.


**Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) shares slumped 11% on the heels of the company's analyst day on Tuesday. RBC Capital maintained an outperform rating but lowered its price target to 212 from 225. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) fell more than 2% on a [Citi downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-cracks-after-analyst-downgrade-to-neutral/) to neutral from buy. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) tumbled 7% on a Morgan Stanley downgrade to equal-weight from overweight.



Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gave back 1.2%, hurt by weakness in **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), which ended with losses of around 4%. Results from Atlassian are due Thursday after the close.


Homebuilders Rise Again
-----------------------


Homebuilders outperformed on news [U.S. homebuilder sentiment hit its highest level since February 2018](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/housing-market-stocks-hit-new-highs/). But the big leaders in the group like **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) and **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) are all well-extended from proper entry points. Another top performer in the group, **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), is still in buy range after reclaiming an alternate entry of 31.33.


In other stock market news, [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) stock **Tech Data** ([TECD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECD)) soared nearly 12%. Reuters reported that private equity firm Apollo Global Management is interesting in buying the company for $5 billion, or $130 a share.


China-based **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) extended gains after topping a 282.33 entry Tuesday. Shares rose another 3% to 294.77.


Meanwhile, drug distributors **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)), **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)) and **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) rallied sharply on news the three are in talks to [pay $18 billion to settle opioid litigation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/opioid-epidemic-settlement-could-be-underway-mckesson-amerisourcebergen-cardinal/).

In other news, the latest reading on newsletter writer sentiment from Investors Intelligence still favors the bulls. It rose to 49.1% after plunging to 47.6% last week. Decidedly bullish readings over 55% call for defensive measures. That's because extreme bullishness has been seen near several market tops in the past.

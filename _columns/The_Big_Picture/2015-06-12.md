Stocks ended the week on a down note Friday, but the selling pressure never got intense. After two straight closes above its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 lost 0.7% and ended below the line. The Nasdaq fell 0.6%. Small caps fared the best as the Russell 2000 gave up just 0.3%. The IBD 50 also held up well, down 0.3%, helped by **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), which jumped more than 6.5%. The chipmaker has made an impressive move but is also showing some signs of a climax top.

  

Market breadth wasn't too bad as declining stocks outnumber advancers by less than 2-to-1 on both main exchanges.

  

The market is jittery because of the Greece stalemate, but its focus is also on the U.S. economy, a recent surge in bond yields and of course, the Fed. Although not set in stone, a rate hike at the September meeting is possible. The Fed is scheduled to meet this week, and the policy statement is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

  

Despite Friday's selling, the put/call volume ratio came in at 0.97, up from a reading of 0.85 on Thursday and 0.70 on Wednesday. Not only are investors getting more fearful, but the bull camp is getting smaller.

  

Earlier in the week, the latest data from Investors Intelligence showed bullish newsletter writers dropping to 47.4%, down from 51.5% last week. It was the third reading below 50 since January. This reading, along with the put/call ratio, are contrarian indicators and potentially good news for the bulls.

  

Friday's weak performance underscored how difficult the current market environment is for investors. A market constantly giving mixed signals is an uncertain market â€” a market not sure of which direction it wants to take.

  

What we know right now is that we're in the later stages of a bull market. We know that the distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is a bit elevated, and we know the overall action in top-rated growth names has been suspect.

  

Successful growth investors share many common traits, including the realization that they don't have to be in the market all the time.

  

They know that with the sluggish performance of most leaders, it is not the time to be aggressively buying stocks. The time to make big money in growth stocks is after a meaningful pullback, when sellers get flushed out of the market and fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines. We're not in that place now.

  

The best argument the bull camp has at this point is that even though growth names are generally having problems making headway, seriously broken charts are few and far between. In the chip space, just because recent breakouts from the likes of **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) have stalled doesn't mean the market's about to roll over.

  

Bright spots were few in Friday's session but **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) was one. The stock priced at 19 and closed at 30.59 on its first day of trading. Group peer **Papa Murphy's** ([FRSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRSH)) jumped 7% as it approached a buy point of 20.10.

  

**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) was another one. The small cap and new issue isn't profitable yet but shows nice sales growth in recent quarters. The stock blasted out of an IPO base Friday, surging 9%.

  

Other charts to watch include **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)) and **Luxoft** ([LXFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LXFT)).

Stocks ended mixed in a back-and-forth session Monday, continuing a pattern of mildly choppy action.


Despite weakness in energy stocks, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% to a new closing high after bouncing back from a 0.3% loss. After an intraday tug-of-war, the index closed little changed for the fifth straight session.


The Nasdaq trimmed a 0.7% deficit to 0.4%. But it still ended a five-day win streak amid weakness in software stocks.


The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1%. Small caps fared the worst, as the Russell 2000 dropped 0.8%.


The IBD 50 lost 0.7% as **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) slid 4% and 3%, respectively. Jazz tried to break out Nov. 5 but has since been trading sideways.


Stocks got off to a weak start Monday as news of Japan falling into recession offset news of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. Oilfield services giant **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) agreed to buy rival **Baker Hughes** ([BHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHI)) for $34.6 billion.


Drugmaker **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) announced that it's buying **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) for $66 billion in cash and stock. Actavis beat a rival bid from **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) for the Botox maker.


Volume ended lower on both major exchanges. Trade fell on both exchanges from Friday's already light pace. Volume was again below average on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Winners beat losers by 5-to-4 on the NYSE and nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Though nothing drastic, the market is showing a few chinks in the armor.


The advance/decline lines of the NYSE and Nasdaq have lagged as the major indexes recently hit record or multiyear highs. This makes it more of a stock picker's market.


A few leaders are taking some heat. Last week, **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) were some of the high-rated stocks that fell in heavy trading.


On Monday, **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) dropped nearly 5% in fast trade and closed back below its 232.38 buy point. Reports that **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) may enter into social networking for professionals pretty much erased last week's gains for LinkedIn.


On the positive side, the overall level of distribution in the market remains low and breakouts continue to take place.


**Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)) and **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) both cleared buy points on Monday. Volume, however, wasn't great for either stock.

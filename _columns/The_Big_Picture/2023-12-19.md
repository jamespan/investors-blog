Buyers pushed the stock market higher again Tuesday as Wall Street weighed a better-than-expected reading on November housing starts. Falling bond yields and more weakness in the U.S. dollar also brought buyers in the from the sidelines with the Santa Claus rally in full effect.




Small caps outperformed again, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) up 1.9%. The ETF closed above the 200 level for the first time since August 2022, as it appears to clear resistance at that level. Looking at its weekly chart, it's still in the early stages of breaking out of a cup base that started in August.


November housing starts came in at 1.56 million units, well above the 1.36 million consensus estimate. The strong data fueled a 1.8% gain for IBD's homebuilder group. But the leaders in the group like **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) have already tacked on big gains from buy points. DHI joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on Nov. 14 before clearing a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) on Dec. 1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP121923_2-248x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite, up 0.7%, marked its ninth straight gain and closed just above 15,000 level. It's a round number and a potential resistance level to watch, although the Nasdaq didn't have any trouble moving above the 14,000 level last month.


But that move came when the Nasdaq was still in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend after the index marked a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) on Nov. 1. The Nasdaq has rallied more than 14% since then, meaning the 15,000 level could be a tougher nut to crack.


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. The Dow Jones marked its fifth straight record close, the first time it's done that since the five days ending Aug. 16, 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Breadth was strong again Tuesday. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by just over 4-to-1. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 positive on the Nasdaq.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is also starting to show some outperformance. After rising nearly 4% last week, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is up close to 2% so far this week.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) rallied 4% Tuesday. The provider of offshore vessels and support services to the oil and gas industry is back above its 50-day moving average as it forms a new base. But it's a [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-tell-if-a-growth-stocks-run-is-getting-too-old/).

Market breadth has expanded bullishly beyond the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/), which drove a lot of the market's gains this year. According to data from Barchart.com, 87% of all stocks in the Nasdaq composite are trading above their 50-day lines. For the S&P 500, it's around 89%.


Be Patient, Don't Chase
-----------------------


While it's still OK to look for stocks breaking out of bases, it's also a good idea to be patient and wait for pullbacks in some of the big leaders. Base breakouts were plentiful when the stock market uptrend was confirmed in early November, but they're getting harder to find now. And some stocks forming bases now could end being laggards in their groups.


A stock like **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) is near the top of a cup base, but **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) has emerged as the big leader in the group.


In the financial sector, a name like **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) might look attractive as it holds in a buy zone from a 68.80 entry. But a lot of leading financial stocks have been showing better relative strength than Schwab.



Putting a financial stock like **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) on the watchlist makes perfect sense after a bullish breakout in heavy volume. Or a regional bank like **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)), which hasn't looked back after its Nov. 29 breakout.


Several stocks in the construction products group should also be watched for alternate entries after bullish price gains. They include **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)), **Azek** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)) and **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)), among others.


Watching Biotech
----------------


Even biotechs have started to show some signs of life. After soaring above its 200-day moving average last week, the iShares Biotech ETF ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) has been stubborn about giving back gains.


**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is back in a buy zone from a 387.42 entry after a two-day pullback. It's the highest-weighted holding in the biotech ETF at just over 9%. Shares soared more than 17% last week after Vertex said its experimental nonopioid painkiller significantly decreased pain in diabetics suffering from chronic nerve pain. The drug is also being looked at to treat acute pain, with the next batch of data due in the first quarter of 2024.


Above all else, avoid the pitfall of chasing extended stocks in an extended market.

  Dow Jones, Nasdaq Keep Bullish Spirit Alive; Will These 7 Growth Stocks Make Investors More Thankful?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surely isn't the leading stock market index lately. Yet its action over the past few weeks indicates that bullish action is widening across the spectrum.




Thus, even the blue chip index should not get ignored when taking a holistic view of U.S. stocks.


An early 0.5% lift by the 30-stock Dow Jones industrials had trailed a bigger intraday rise by the Nasdaq composite. By session's close, the two finished up 0.5%. Both indexes lagged a 0.7% rise by the Russell 2000 and a gain of almost 0.6% by SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)).


Other sector indexes lagged. The Dow transportation average rose 0.2%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index marched 0.3% ahead, but VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) eased 0.2%.


The S&P 500 ambled 0.4% ahead, keeping chances alive that the large-cap benchmark will rise for a fourth week in a row.


At 4556, the 500 is now a 1.1% rally away from taking out its year-to-date high of 4607. The index stands 5.5% below its all-time peak, set in the first week of 2022, of 4818.


Breadth continued to improve on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Early data showed winners exceeded losers on the Nasdaq by more than 1,000 issues and by a 9-5 margin on the NYSE.


Teflon Response
---------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP112223-285x300.jpg)The stock market shrugged off two key pieces of economic data.


One, durable goods orders in October fell 5.4% vs. the prior month, more than the [Econoday estimate](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a 3.2% decline. In September, orders rose by a downwardly revised 4%. Excluding transportation equipment, orders came in flat vs. September, down from a revised 0.2% gain in the prior month.


Also, the monthly Conference Board's consumer sentiment survey found that one-year inflation expectations ticked up to 4.5%, above economists' forecast of 4.4%.


Reports of a possible terrorist explosion at the Rainbow Bridge on the U.S.-Canada border in Niagara Falls, N.Y., failed to disrupt traders' bullish mood.


The U.S. Treasury 10-year government note traded flat, leaving the yield at 4.41%.


Dow Jones Vs. Nasdaq
--------------------


Wednesday's mild advance hoisted the Dow industrials up 6.4% for the year. That pales against a 36.3% rally by the Nasdaq composite. Yet, is any comparison between the two benchmarks really fair at all?


One could make an argument that it's not. One, the Dow Jones, is price-weighted. The other is market value-weighted. Take a look at the 10 largest components of the Nasdaq composite, right above the daily chart found in the General Market Indicators PDF page (found as a link at the bottom of each Big Picture column).


Besides, the Dow Jones is, at least in one way, mirroring the growing breadth of the stock market's fledgling uptrend.


For sure, some of its components are having an awful year. **Walgreens Boot Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) is the worst name within the bunch, at least in this metric: WBA shares are trading 51% below the 52-week high. Put another way, the stock would need to rally more than 100% just to reach its old high.


**3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) and oil and gas integrated major player **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) have fallen sharply off their peaks, too. However, the median Dow Jones stock trades just 10% off its 52-week high.


That's a bullish change.


It implies that even blue chip stocks are getting more in position to complete a good base, then break out to new highs.


Volume cooled off on both main exchanges vs. the prior session ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The S&P 500 lost its sole remaining [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to the strength of its current advance.


On Friday, the stock market will open at the usual time but close at 1 p.m. ET.

Commodities Still Take A Back Seat
----------------------------------


The gain in equities actually deserves more credit when you consider what's been going in other markets, such as commodities.


Crude oil futures cannot catch a break.


Light sweet crude oil slid 1.1% to $76.88 a barrel on the NYMEX. Market observers are wondering what OPEC+ will do when it meets at the end of this month.


"I expect when OPEC+ meets that they want to 'shock' world crude oil markets with a slightly larger production cut," veteran fund manager Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates wrote in an email comment sent to IBD.


Could future OPEC+ cuts, however, counter bulging U.S. oil inventories?

Give Thanks To These Stocks?
----------------------------


Nobody knows how long the current confirmed uptrend will last. So many factors come into play that determine the length and strength of a new market rally.


Here's what every IBD reader can do now:


Keep a focused list of high-quality growth stocks and watch them like a hawk. Then, muster the confidence and courage to buy shares at the right moment, even though one's peers or friends are dismissing the indexes' newfound strength. Remember, the biggest gains are typically made in the beginning stages of a rally, not in the late stages.



The following seven stocks have not only appeared in IBD stock lists, indicating they are leading the market, but also show potential for further gains:


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) (92 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), 95 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/)): CEO Lisa Su has commanded well-deserved respect in Silicon Valley since she took over the reins in October 2014.


Since then, the MIT graduate with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and former manager at **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and Freescale Semiconductor has overseen a push to create new products that have focused on excellence in data processing and performance in mission critical markets such as the data center. From the October 2014 high of 3.46 — not adjusted for stock splits — AMD stock has vaulted more than 35-fold.


AMD is attempting a fresh breakout past a 122.11 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a long [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


**ARM** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) (80 Composite, 43 RS): The 2023 IPO actually traded earlier in this millennium under the ticker ARMHY before getting acquired by Softbank. The leader in semiconductor designs is working on a [first-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). Shares are up sharply since debuting on the Nasdaq two months ago at 51 a share. ARM also joined the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist).



**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) (99 Composite, 94 RS): The large-cap cloud applications-monitoring expert is outperforming major indexes, including the Dow Jones and even the Nasdaq 100, since the Nov. 1 follow-through day. DDOG has pole-vaulted 40% since the Nov. 1 close, due in large part to an earnings-inspired gap-up in price.


Wall Street sees and earnings boost of 53% to $1.50 a share this year and up another 20% in 2024 to $1.80. Datadog turned profitable in 2020, earning 22 cents a share that year. Sales totaled $2.01 billion in the past four quarters. DDOG makes the William J. O'Neil screen for top stocks in [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). It holds a [quarter-size position in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Dow Jones Leader Up 188% From Covid Pandemic Low
------------------------------------------------


**UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) (89 Composite, 84 RS): The managed care firm expanded into data analytics with its Optum unit, which has helped sustain steady growth. On Oct. 13, management boosted the range of the company's 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to $24.85-$25 a share. Wall Street sees earnings rising 9% this year to $24.20 a share — quadrupling from $8.05 a share in 2016 — and accelerating 12% to $27.03 in 2024.


**Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) (96 Composite, 95 RS): The homebuilder focuses on the luxury end of the residential home market. Earnings grew 400% from $2.18 a share in fiscal 2016 to $10.90 in fiscal 2022. But is the weak earnings estimate for the current fiscal year 2024 ($11.91, down 1%) a concern?


So far, institutional investors seem to continue accumulating shares. Mutual funds owning shares rose to 815 at the end of the third quarter vs. 707 in the fourth quarter of 2022, 745 in Q1 and 778 in Q2. In total, funds own 58% of all 107.5 million shares outstanding. The stock has traded tightly since it cleared a nine-week cup with handle at 82.39.


Perhaps value investors are still salivating over Toll's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7 times its annual EPS estimate of $12.05.


Industry compatriot **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) has grabbed a spot in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).



**Immunogen** ([IMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMGN)) (89 Composite Rating, 99 Relative Strength): This stock made Wednesday's biggest percentage gain within the IBD 50. So far unprofitable, the stock gets a weaker 76 Earnings Per Share Rating. But sales have exploded in recent quarters, up 67%, 47%, 31%, 487% and 638% vs. year-ago levels over the past five quarters. Total revenue over that period for the developer of cytotoxic agents to attack cancer cells topped $300 million.


**Carpenter Technology** ([CRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRS)) (99 Composite, 96 RS). The stock got written up in Wednesday's [MarketDiem daily e-newsletter](https://get.investors.com/marketdiem/?intcode=lgnv%7Clgnv%7Cprdmcst%7C2022%7C10%7Cmkdm%7Cna%7C%7C832881&src=A00653).


Don't Break This Rule
---------------------


Be sure never to chase any of these seven potential big winners past a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


Always consider how far a stock has rallied past key technical levels, including the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


For instance, DDOG is currently trading 11% above its 21-day line. When the stock market pulls back, expect leaders to do the same. Datadog could essentially pull back 11% to this key moving average and knock out new buyers with the 7% loss sell rule, even though its near-term uptrend would remain in place.

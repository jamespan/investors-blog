Stocks Stall, But Here Are 4 Bold Items
========================================

Stock indexes took small steps backward Friday. Meanwhile, the week presented some bold possibilities for investors who knew where to look.




The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each slipped 0.1% Friday, while the Dow Jones industrial average was flat. The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE. Friday involved options expirations, which often boosts trade.


Weekly action in the major indexes was essentially flat, but four areas communicated confidence.


* Select blue chips: Two stocks in the Dow are on the verge of breaking out.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP072018-264x300.jpg)Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose for a fourth week in a row. The stock is closing in on a 194.30 buy point in a very shallow pattern.


Apple reset its base count in February when it undercut the low of the previous base.


Fellow Dow component **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) edged above a 201.70 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. But strong volume was missing.


Apple and Home Depot each have a 92 Composite Rating. A rating of 92 means the stock is in the top 8% of all the stocks in IBD's database.


* Money centers: This was the week the big banks finally got some respect. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) rose 5.4% for the week; **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), 4.6%; **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), 4.5%; **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), 3.3%; and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), 2.3%.


Yet the weekly gains drew no comment in much of the financial media, other than earnings news, which is often a good contrarian sign.

* Tariff threats: On Friday, President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on all Chinese goods. The stock market shrugged. The market apparently is convinced that Trump is playing a bluffing game.
* Treasuries: The yield on the 30-year bond rose 6.3 basis points Friday to 3.03%, according to preliminary data. The 10-year yield gained 4.2 basis points to 2.89%. The 2-year yield edged up 1 basis point to 2.61%.


The action eased fears that a yield-curve inversion is near, which is regarded as bearish.


Coming Up
---------

  Nasdaq Leads Still-Undecided Market; This Divergence Hasn't Happened Since 1995

The major indexes closed higher Wednesday, although the stock market remained unclear about its intentions.




Bulls and bears seem to be at an impasse, with neither side committing itself. For now, the market is holding up as selling in some tech leaders subsides. Yet, a narrow set of pillars is propping up stocks. Will more solid investments arrive to shore up the market?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP062624-233x300.jpg)The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.2%. It was the sixth straight day the index moved less than 0.5%. The dull action is not necessarily bad. Remember that the major indexes had become stretched and The Big Picture noted that some moderation would be welcome.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.5% Wednesday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up less than 0.1%. The fact both closed higher may not seem like much. But Wednesday ended a streak in which the two indexes moved in opposite directions eight of the previous 10 sessions — something that hadn't happened since April 1995, according to Dow Jones Market Data. A rotation away from techs contributed to that.


Small caps continued to flounder, with the Russell 2000 off 0.2% Wednesday after meeting resistance at the 50-day moving average this week.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and edged lower on the New York Stock Exchange.


Stock Market Rotation Continues
-------------------------------


When sellers hit the technology sector last week — including the armada of artificial intelligence stocks — alarm bells went off for bulls.


Since the Nasdaq made its last closing high on June 18, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) has fallen 2.2%. This has been the stock market's strongest sector year to date, so its sudden weakness is no small matter.


Investors aren't moving money into many other sectors, however. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) and Communications Services Select Sector SPDR ([XLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLC))  — comprised largely of **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) — are up more than 2% in the past week.


The consumer discretionary index is up more than 1% and health care is barely higher. But all other S&P sector indexes are down.



Another issue for the stock market is the paucity of breakouts among high-rated stocks. In the MarketSurge 250 index, fewer than a dozen stocks topped buy points the past two weeks. And most of those breakouts are lackluster.


For example, **Hess Midstream** ([HESM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HESM)), **Hartford Financial** ([HIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIG)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) have ducked back into their bases.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is doing better, however, now 7% above its 199.62 buy point. Shares found support at the [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/).


And it was a landmark day for **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which [topped a $2 trillion market cap](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-price-target-hike-retail-effeciency/) for the first time. It is the fifth company to achieve that distinction. To boot, Amazon stock broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) with a 191.70 buy point.


Magnificent Seven Still Lord Over Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


That's important for the broad market, because the Magnificent Seven still account for much of the major indexes' performance.


Meta is close to breaking out of a cup-with-handle base. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rallied 3.8% Wednesday and is near a breakout around 200. Stifel initiated coverage on the electric-vehicle maker with a buy rating, and Tesla shareholders [shrugged off news of a major investment](https://www.investors.com/news/rivian-stock-volkswagen-partnership-will-it-work/) by **Volkswagen** ([VWAGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)) in rival **Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)).


After a [three-day, 16% rout](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-now/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) bounced off its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) Tuesday and edged higher Wednesday.


Of course, the stock market cannot live off the Magnificent Seven forever, and Wednesday was another day of unconvincing breadth.


Decliners outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq and NYSE Wednesday. The number of 52-week lows is roughly even with new highs, based on Investor's Business Daily's tally of stocks with an Earnings Per Share Rating above 60.


Equal-weighted indexes — which blunt the impact of the few megacap stocks — look more bearish than the cap-weighted indexes.


Market Breadth A Question Mark
------------------------------


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) exchange traded fund fell 0.4% Wednesday, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since June 14. By comparison, the S&P 500 is more than 4% above its 50-day line.


Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight Index ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) lost 0.5%. It's up 2.3% so far this month, compared with a 6.6% rise in the Nasdaq 100 index.


IBD is keeping its recommended stock market exposure at 80% to 100%. Because there's no new blood coming into the market leadership — i.e., little in the way of new breakouts — a proper target is closer to 80%. In other words, many leaders are worth holding, but it's hard to add new stocks.


Further, the IBD 50 index fell 0.4% Wednesday, another sign that stock market fortunes are selective.

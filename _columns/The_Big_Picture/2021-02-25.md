Conditions worsened for the stock market Thursday, a day of heavy losses that took the Nasdaq composite below a critical price level.




The Nasdaq slid under its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and closed below it, just two days after it made a stand at that key price level. In fact, the Nasdaq has now failed expectations sparked by Tuesday's positive reversal, and that leaves the stock market with new doubts.


The Nasdaq's 3.5% pummeling was its worst day since Sept. 9 and it led the stock market's broad retreat. Declining stocks led advancers by more than 6-to-1 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


The S&P 500 was tossed for a 2.4% loss but barely held above its 50-day line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8%. Small caps, a leading sector in 2020, were rattled as well. The Russell 2000 index plunged 3.7%.

The steep index losses in higher volume meant another [distribution da](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/)y for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The heavy selling marked a change in character for the stock market, and so [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) was lowered today to "uptrend under pressure."


Aside from a two-day period of uncertainty, on Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, the market outlook had been in "confirmed uptrend" since Nov. 4. The bulls look tired from that long advance, and the stock market could use a pause right now.


How To Trade In A Changed Stock Market
--------------------------------------


It's impossible to know how long or how deep the market will contract. But while the outlook remains in doubt, investors must take appropriate steps.


First, be sure to [sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Second, take at least some profits to raise cash. In a bad market, there's no better safe harbor than cash. Third, avoid buying stocks unless there's an [exceptional breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).



The technology and consumer discretionary sectors are taking the brunt of this week's selling. But energy and cyclical stocks are performing better. Many of the breakouts in the past week came from those sectors and others such as financials. If the market can make a quick recovery, those areas may furnish early opportunities.


Leading stocks offered no solace Thursday. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) tumbled 4.3%. Earnings reports got a cool reception on Wall Street, even when they exceeded expectations.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), for example, [beat fourth-quarter estimates and gave bullish guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-q4-2021-earnings-nvda-stock/). Yet, the graphics-chip leader sold off more than 8%. **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) was routed for a 14% loss that sent shares below the 50-day line in heavy trading. The cannabis-focused REIT missed profit targets.


Rising Yields Hurt Stock Market
-------------------------------


A surge in Treasury yields on the long end of the yield curve appears to be frightening the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit 1.49%, the highest level in a year. It has shot up from 0.92% at the start of 2021.


Rates have been climbing largely on expectations of an economic rebound as coronavirus cases drop and social distancing restrictions start falling. But while that's generally a positive trend for the market, the sudden rise in yields presents a number of challenges for stocks. For one, it makes borrowing costs higher, especially for many growth companies. It also indicates that inflation is on the move. Higher yields also make bonds more appealing compared with stocks.

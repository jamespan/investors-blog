title: Stocks Mixed As A Key Piece Of The Nasdaq Shows Unusual Weakness

Indexes were mixed Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite uncharacteristically lagged while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 stretched to record highs.




 The Dow added 0.5% thanks to leading gains by **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), the two stocks with highest weightings in the Dow average.


Goldman is still in buy range from a 247.17 buy point. Banking stocks rallied on expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise the fed funds rate by a quarter point at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday. Boeing made a new high after it announced late Monday an [$18 billion stock buyback and a 20% dividend hike](https://www.investors.com/news/top-performing-dow-stock-boeing-unloads-billions-more-on-investors/).


**Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), another Dow component, climbed 2.6% as it followed through on a breakout past a 51.28 buy point.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP121217-250x300.png)The S&P 500 faded in the final hour and added less than 0.2%. A combination of relative strength in financials, energy, health care and industrial stocks gave the S&P 500 some lift. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


But the Nasdaq erased a meager gain to close 0.2% lower, after the index sought direction through the day. The composite — up 27.5% in 2017 — is still on track to finish the year well ahead of the S&P 500's 19% gain. But major elements of the index such as chip and software stocks are winding down the year with uncertainties.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index has closed below the 50-day moving average for seven straight days, the longest such streak this year. IBD's chipmaker, chip equipment and chip design industry groups have fallen 4.2% to 9.8% in the past four weeks — among the seven worst declines of 197 groups.


A raft of software stocks tumbled Tuesday after a [JPMorgan analyst downgraded a slew of companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-servicenow-security-stocks-fall-on-jpmorgan-outlook/) to neutral from overweight, saying the stocks are unlikely to continue outperforming.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), one of the downgraded stocks, fell 1.7% in active trading. It is one of many techs that remain below their 50-day moving averages since a broad sell-off in late November. To be sure, others such as **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) and **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) have held support at that level. Earnings from Adobe are due Thursday after the close.


Biotech are trending better, but lagged Tuesday with a 1.4% drop. Utilities, which are more concentrated in the S&P 500, also have been weak performers over the past four weeks.


Despite its weak spots, the market is not in any great danger. With window-dressing nearing, it's hard to imagine institutional investors divesting themselves of 2017's winners.


The Nasdaq has five [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) compared with only one on the S&P 500. But a couple will be expiring soon, which will bring the distribution count closer to the S&P's. As they've done other times this year, indexes have shaken off bouts of distribution. Thus, a buildup of distribution days has not served as a good topping indicator as it has in other years.


The stock market is finishing 2017 much in the same way it's behaved all year — making record highs amid low volatility. The main indexes have maintained a remarkable uptrend all year, suffering nothing worse than a 4.4% pullback. Not since June 2016 has the Nasdaq fallen more than 10%, the traditional definition of a market correction.


Those are enviable conditions for investors, and they owe much of it to a healthy amount of sector rotation. An improving U.S. and world economy, the Fed's easy-touch approach to rising interest rates and a great year for corporate profits have served as a solid foundation for the year's success.


Automakers were Tuesday's top industry group. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) almost single-handedly took the group higher after climbing 3.7%. The electric-car maker has risen back above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and is forming a new [base](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/). Because Tesla undercut its prior base, the current pattern can be regarded as a lower-risk first-stage base.

The Nasdaq suffered another distribution Tuesday, as investors gave a thumbs down to earnings reports from Dow components **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)). A weaker-than-expected durable goods report also weighed on sentiment.


Major averages rallied nicely off lows in early afternoon trading but sellers came back into the market late. The Nasdaq took the hardest hit, falling 1.9%. It gapped down at the open and closed below its 50-day moving average. The Dow lost 1.7% and the S&P 500 gave up 1.3%. Small caps fared better, with the Russell 2000 down just 0.5%. The IBD 50 snapped a six-session win streak, falling 0.8%.


Curiously, market breadth wasn't all that bad. Declining stocks topped advancers by less than 2-to-1 on both exchanges.


NYSE volume fell slightly from Monday's levels. Nasdaq volume rose 11%, giving the tech index its second distribution day since the Jan. 8 follow-through.


The distribution-day count may be light, and the market may still be in a confirmed uptrend, but that doesn't mean it's an easy environment to make money in stocks.


**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) is an example of how challenging the market is when it comes to breakouts. Illumina cleared a 196.10 buy point in heavy volume in early January but triggered a sell signal when it fell more than 8% below the buy point. It regained its footing last week, rising 7%. Late Tuesday, the provider of gene-sequencing technology reported another quarter of solid growth. Shares rose in the after-hours session.


When it comes to blue-chip names, it's hard to be optimistic about Q4 earnings season in light of a [strong U.S. dollar](http://news.investors.com/business/012715-736509-strong-dollar-flexes-despite-flabby-outlook.htm).


When the dollar is strong, it hurts earnings at large-cap companies with a lot of overseas sales. (See story [here](http://news.investors.com/business/012715-736583-strong-dollar-flexes-despite-flabby-outlook.htm).) Those hoping for the strong dollar-weak euro story line to flip might have to wait a while, especially in light of the European Central Bank's new stimulus.


The dollar weakened considerably after the Fed launched its QE program, helping the U.S. stock market.


The dollar fell for the second straight session Tuesday, helping oil to a 2.4% gain. March crude added $1.08 to $46.23 a barrel. On Monday, OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah el-Badri said oil may have bottomed after a seven-month sell-off.


In economic news, orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell 3.4% in December, well below expectations for a gain of 0.7%. The decline was led by a 55.5% plunge in orders for commercial aircraft. Excluding transportation, orders fell 0.8% vs. estimates for a 0.8% gain. November orders were revised lower to -2.1% from -0.9%.


In Tuesday's after-hours session,**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) jumped 5% after the technology bellwether reported strong earnings. It's the highest weighted stock in the **Powershares QQQ** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100. It rose 1.1% in after hours, giving bulls some hope for a solid open Wednesday.


Software leader **Open Text** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)) wasn't so lucky. Shares fell in after-hours trading after fiscal Q2 sales missed expectations.

Stocks rebounded after a poor start Wednesday and the major indexes closed near session highs.

  

But leading growth stocks struggled as a whole. The IBD 50 dropped more than 1.2%.

  

In contrast, the day's biggest gainers were concentrated among oil exploration and defensive groups, including candy makers, electric utilities and health insurers.

  

The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, a positive reversal from an initial 0.4% decline. The Dow Jones industrials rallied 0.7%. The Nasdaq sliced an early 1.5% loss to 0.3%.

  

Eight of the Dow's 30 stocks gained 1 point or more, including **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). The managed care titan jumped 2.65 to 77.91. It recently snapped a three-quarter streak of earnings-per-share gains with a 5% drop in the first quarter. It holds a mediocre Composite Rating of 74.

  

Fresh data released Wednesday showed that the U.S. economy, although growing, remains under a cloud. First-quarter nonfarm productivity sank 1.7%, much deeper than what economists on consensus had forecast. On top of that, unit labor costs grew 4.2%, much higher than expected.

  

Yet traders seemed to focus more on testimony from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen to Congress. During Wednesday's remarks, she stressed that a flattening housing market and strife in Ukraine are serious risks to the American economy. Yellen hinted that there would be no change in the central bank's strategy of keeping the cost of money ultracheap for an extended period of time.

  

IBD's Market Indexes table (on Page B11) has shown that defensive stocks have been leading the upside so far in 2014. For the growth investor, that's a bad sign. Breakouts by companies that show above-average top- and bottom-line growth are the avenue to portfolio outperformance. These days, outside the oil and gas patch, such rallies have been rare.

  

Instead, the market is witnessing numerous growth stocks either digging deeper bottoms (see **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) and **Zulily** ([ZU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZU)) or making feeble breakouts (**Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)).

  

The persistently high ratio of bullish newsletter writers (see the Investors Intelligence charts on B11) may partially be explained by the fact that the S&P 500 is merely 1% below its high. However, Hays Advisory notes that stocks in the S&P 1500 index, a broad gauge, are on average down 13.9% from their 52-week highs. Hays calls it an "internal correction."

  

Among S&P 500 stocks as of Tuesday's close, the average stock was 9.3% off its peak. What accounts for this? A few megacaps in the index, such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), are trading just below 52-week highs.

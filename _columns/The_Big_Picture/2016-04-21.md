Stocks struggled Thursday with unexpectedly bad economic data and the second day of an aggressive sell-off in utility stocks.


![MP042216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP042216-1-136x300.jpg)The Nasdaq fell fractionally, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. The IBD 50 retreated 0.5%.


Volume slipped on both major exchanges, though barely on the NYSE.


The action was bad enough to bring the uptrend under pressure, even if it wasn't quite bad enough to slap the indexes with a distribution day.


Recent distribution has had an odd tilt. For instance, the stalling form of distribution suffered Wednesday on the S&P 500 probably would've been avoided if not for utility stocks. All 29 utilities in the S&P 500 dived in the past two sessions, with many suffering sharp losses.


**Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)) dropped 6.5% over the two sessions and **Southern Company** ([SO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SO)), 4%.


Traders have various explanations for what's going on in utilities. Some are convinced that oil has bottomed and that inflation is coming. Others say the selling is only profit-taking.


The clear reality is that funds are selling utilities. That money will eventually go somewhere, which bulls hope will help the growth camp.


Meanwhile, the world of economic news dumped its own problems on the market.


Although first-time jobless claims were about 7% fewer than expected, other economic reports were discouraging. Leading indicators for March came in at 0.2% vs. views for 0.5%. Home prices for February could only match expectations, and the Chicago Fed National Activity index for March dug further south.


The most disturbing piece of news, though, came from the Philadelphia Fed's business outlook survey for April. The Street expected a 9.0 reading. Instead, the gauge came in at -1.6.


Worse yet, the Philadelphia Fed said that manufacturers are now spending more money on regulatory compliance than they do on data and network security, or on equipment and workers.


The tepid U.S. economic recovery has drawn fire over the regulatory burden on business, but such talk can sound like political honk. However, the Philadelphia Fed’s first-ever survey on regulatory costs confirms that something is wrong.


After the close, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) lost 4% and 5% in after-hours trade. Both companies served up unsatisfying quarterly results. A few other big-cap stocks were falling on earnings news after the close, and their losses figure to weigh on the market Friday.

The stock market ended mixed Thursday, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell concluded his testimony before Congress with no major surprises. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes bounced Thursday, ending their three-day losing streaks.




As the stock market uptrend pulls back from its 2023 highs, these four stock market leaders are exhibiting signs of strength: [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)), recent [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)).


Ahead of Thursday's open, first-time jobless claims rose to 264,000, above estimates. They were expected to ease to 261,000 vs. 262,000 in the previous week, per Econoday estimates. Further, May existing home sales numbers from the National Association of Realtors unexpectedly rose to 4.3 million. They were expected to dip slightly to an annualized rate of 4.25 million vs. April's 4.28 million.


**Darden Restaurants** ([DRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRI)) and **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) were key earnings movers Thursday. Darden shares sold off 2.6%, while KBH stock declined almost 1% after trimming a larger loss.


Powell Testimony
----------------


Powell concluded his testimony Thursday in front of the Senate Banking Committee, after he addressed a House committee Wednesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP062223-263x300.jpg)On Wednesday, [Powell reiterated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-says-interest-rate-pause-is-expected-to-be-temporary-576d1f64) that more interest rate increases are likely needed to bring down inflation, saying "Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year."


Investors now see a nearly 77% chance of a quarter-point hike at the Fed's July meeting, per [CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) That's up from 67% one week ago.


Meanwhile, the [Bank of England raised its key interest rate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-interest-rates-fb6332a6) by a half-percentage point, upping the lending rate to 5%, its highest level since April 2008.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average cut losses to close essentially flat. In the Dow 30, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) triggered the 7% loss rule from a 221.33 buy point. BA stock fell more than 3% to extend a losing streak to three sessions.


Market performance varied by index. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite advanced nearly 1%. But the small-cap Russell 2000 moved down 0.8%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE from the prior session. Declining stocks topped advancers by an 8-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 2-to-1 on the NYSE. New lows led new highs by about 8-5 on the Nasdaq, too. The weaker volume and breadth put a damper on the S&P and Nasdaq gains.


The [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remains at two apiece.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.4% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) rallied 5.3% Thursday, nearing a new high. Its advance from a 122.24 buy point is large enough that investors who bought near that entry can take some profits.


Despite the stock market pullback, IBD's recommended market exposure still sits at 60%-80%. So far, the market pullback is normal, but keep an eye out for more signs of institutional selling. If distribution days start to pile up, then it would be prudent to methodically reduce exposure.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Chipotle, McKesson, Meritage, MongoDB
--------------------------------------------------------------------



Chipotle is rebounding from its 10-week line and approaching a flat base's 2,139.88 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Chipotle was [Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chipotle-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-rebounds-toward-record-highs/).


McKesson is in buy range past a 401.53 cup-with-handle entry. The 5% buy zone goes up to 421.61. Shares tacked on 0.6% Thursday.


The company is the biggest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S., leading **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) and **AmerisourceBergen** ([ABC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABC)), according to JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill. She estimates McKesson controls 37% of U.S. pharmaceutical drug sales. Further, the company is moving deeper into specialty medicines.


Meritage Homes finished Thursday in the 5% buy zone above a 130.68 buy point of a flat base. The buy area runs up to 137.21. [The strong rebound in new home construction in May](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/housing-rebound-lifts-meritage-homes-stock-to-buy-point/) gave a further boost to one of the stock market's [hottest industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jun-16-2023/).


[MongoDB is trading tightly](https://www.investors.com/research/ai-stock-mongodb-eyes-buy-point-after-mdb-stock-surges-on-earnings/) after its recent earnings-fueled gap-up, offering a new entry, per [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The three-weeks-tight formation shows a buy point at 398.89, while aggressive investors could use a trendline-entry around 386.

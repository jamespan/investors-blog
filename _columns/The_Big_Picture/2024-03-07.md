The stock market rallied Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched more record highs. Up next, Wall Street will shift its attention to the February jobs report.




Meanwhile, stock market leaders **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)), **Block** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) and **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) are in or near buy zones on the stock market today.


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims rose to 217,000, still indicating no slowing in the labor market. Claims were expected to remain unchanged at 215,000 from the previous week.


Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Thursday. On Wednesday, Powell told a House panel that it's too soon to lower interest rates but that reductions are likely sometime this year.


Friday, the [February jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-key-for-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/) is expected to show job growth of 190,000. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7%. The employment report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.


Revisions to January's surprising 353,000 payrolls gain, including 317,000 private-sector jobs, could be an important factor. The initially reported gain of 443,000 private-sector jobs in January 2023 was eventually revised down to 359,000.


After the market closed Thursday, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) reported their earnings results.


[Broadcom shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-stock-avgo-stock-fiscal-q1-2024-earnings-report/) tumbled more than 3% in extended trade, while [Costco stock](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-q4-2023-earnings-ross-abercrombie-costco-dicks/) was down 4.7% in the after-hours session. **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) sold off 13% after the close following its earnings report.

What To Do Now
--------------


After Thursday's gains, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are back to setting new highs, rebounding nicely from Tuesday's sell-off. IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%, keeping in mind that a pullback now would not be surprising. The overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend."


While the stock market rally continues to show strength, there still aren't very many actionable ideas. That's because most of the best stocks are weeks into their price advances and aren't near follow-on buy areas. For example, [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list showed zero stocks.


Instead, be patient and wait for new opportunities to put your capital to work. Keep an eye out for rebounds from the 10-week line. A breather in the major stock indexes would lead to new base formations among leading stocks.


Keep track of emerging bases with the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks. For example, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) has a 73.91 cup-with-handle entry.

Stock Market Leaders: ArcBest, Square
-------------------------------------



Meanwhile, market leaders ArcBest, Block, Fifth Third and Tidewater are in or near buy zones Thursday.


[ArcBest](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/arcbest-ibd-stock-of-the-day-buy-point-trucking/)is clearing a [four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) pattern that started after the trucking company's early-February earnings report. The current pattern has a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 146.24, according to [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/) charts. Aggressive investors could use the 145.10 Feb. 12 high as an early entry opportunity. ArcBest is the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/arcbest-ibd-stock-of-the-day-buy-point-trucking/).


[Square parent Block](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/square-stock-square-expands-cash-app-consumer-banking/) is adding a high handle to a cup base, taking the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) to 83.29. A short-lived breakout past an 80.29 entry failed on Tuesday when the stock fell 7% from the buy trigger.


[Fifth Third](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/fifth-third-bancorp-breaks-out-amid-banking-stocks-rally/) is in buy range from a 35.73 buy point following this week's sharp gains.

Indexes Climb But S&P 500 Stalls
=================================

The stock market continued its advance Tuesday, but some subtle institutional selling surfaced.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, closing near session highs and at the highest level since March 2000.

  

But the S&P 500 added just 0.1% after giving up what had been a 0.4% gain early on.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The S&P 500 closed above 2000 for the first time ever, although that achievement didn't stop it from suffering a setback on its chart.

  

Stalling behavior indicated that institutional investors sold into strength, a pattern that investors should regard as a distribution day. It was the first distribution day for the market since the day before the Nasdaq's follow-through two weeks ago.

  

A blemish it may be, but the indexes have little to complain about as they continue rising from their early-August lows.

  

There is some slack in the indexes, though. While they've been elevating, volume has been limp, causing bearish Accumulation/Distribution Ratings for the indexes.

  

The market has been able to climb this year despite weak accumulation at times. The traditional summertime trading slowdown is a factor to consider.

  

Leading stocks have remained in good shape. The IBD 50 climbed 0.7%, easily outpacing the broad market. About 10 of the 50 stocks made new highs.

  

A lot of the breakouts that occurred in May have stopped advancing. But new consolidations are resulting in base-on-base patterns. The base on base is now one of the most common patterns among top-rated stocks. Watch for those bullish formations to provide new entries.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.9%. It was a solid day for the index, which corrected nearly 9% from its July peak — far deeper than the 3.6% and 4.3% declines of the Nasdaq and S&P 500, respectively.

  

It was unusual to see the Nasdaq and S&P 500 diverge Tuesday, but sector performance was at least partly the reason.

  

Weakness in utilities and transportation dragged the S&P 500, while software, telecom and biotechs gave the Nasdaq a boost.

  

The biotech industry had one of the day's best outings.

  

A Deutsche Bank analyst made bullish comments about **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), citing the potential for positive developments.

  

Several economic reports early Tuesday helped put the market on the right foot.

  

U.S. consumer confidence rose in August to the highest level since October 2007.

  

Durable-goods orders soared 22.6% in July — a record increase, the U.S. Department of Commerce says.

  

But the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index missed expectations. It rose 8.1% in June vs. a year earlier, the seventh month in a row of slowing growth.

  

But the market wasn't much bothered by the housing data. Building stocks were mixed.

  

Some progress was possible in the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which has spooked the market. Russian President Vladimir Putin met Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko for talks Tuesday.

title: Stock Market Climbs Off The Canvas After Pounding; These Challenges Await

The stock market managed to climb off the canvas after taking a pounding for a while on a hotter-than-expected jobs report Friday. But it remains well behind in points heading into another pivotal week.




Indexes were volatile after the report, at one point erasing a 2% gain.


The Nasdaq turned in the best gain of the major averages as it punched its way 1.3% higher. But this is hardly impressive given it was clubbed 5.7% lower for the week. It is now firmly back below [the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tool-50-day-moving-average/).


The S&P 500 also showed grit by turning in a 1.4% gain. Nevertheless, it suffered a body blow after falling 3.3% for the week due to the hawkish tone of Fed Chair Jerome Powell at Wednesday's FOMC meeting. Still, the 50-day line remains in striking distance for now.


Blue chip stocks also did well, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1.3%. Despite falling for the week it remains close to the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/). **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Dow** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) were among the strongest stocks here.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to rise on the NYSE also. Breadth was not particularly impressive, with advancers outnumbering decliners just over 2-1 on the NYSE and not even reaching this level on the Nasdaq.

But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) was on the ropes as it fell 0.7%, near the 50-day line.


Bulls, Bears Battle Over Jobs Report
------------------------------------


The sparring between the bulls and the bears came after another hotter-than-expected jobs report that showed U.S. payrolls surged by 261,000 in October. This was higher than expected.


But Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said there are silver linings emerging.


"There are a lot of signs that support the labor market will continue to soften here," he said in a note to clients. "Service sector hiring has some cracks and that should weaken going forward."


While the market is now over the painful Fed meeting speed bump, yet more challenges are ahead for the coming week. On Thursday, the latest Consumer Price Index data is due. This will cover the October period.


In addition, the [midterm elections are set to take place](https://www.investors.com/research/worried-about-the-midterms-heres-why-it-doesnt-spell-disaster-for-the-dow-jones-president-joe-biden-popularity/). With President Joe Biden suffering from poor approval ratings, a split Congress or even a red wave where the Republicans seize both chambers could be in the offing. Markets tend to rally following the midterms.

Dark Day For Solar Stocks As Gold Miners Shine
----------------------------------------------


As ever, the performance of the industry groups was an illuminating light on the stock market internals. On Friday, it showed materials stocks in favor.



Periodicals, gold miners, metal producers, and specialty steel stocks were shining stars. Oil & gas realty trusts also do well.


Cable stocks, specialty industrial machinery stocks and enterprise software companies struggled. Solar plays also suffered a dark day.


In addition, toys and games plays were hit. This was largely due to the performance of **Funko** ([FNKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNKO)), which plunged 59.4% on earnings and outlook woes.

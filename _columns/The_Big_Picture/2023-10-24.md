The stock market climbed Tuesday as stocks got buoyed by positive earnings reports and economic data. But action remains treacherous for investors, with plenty of pivotal reports due in coming days.




The Nasdaq composite fared best out of the major indexes as it popped 0.9%. It continues to make a stand at the 13,000 level. The tech-heavy index pulled further away from its 200-day moving average but remains firmly below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The Nasdaq is now up 1.2% for the week and nearly 27% for the year.


The S&P 500 also managed to rally, gaining 0.7%. The fact it closed back above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) is a key positive for the bulls but it needs to make the move stick. The benchmark index is up 0.6% for the week so far and is up about 11% in 2023.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by almost 2-1 on the Nasdaq. But the number of issues at 52-week lows exceeded the number at new highs on both exchanges by an order of magnitude.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in a solid gain of 0.6% but remained stuck below its major moving averages. **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) outperformed in the Dow with a mammoth 9.3% gain on a [Q3 earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vz-stock-verizon-earnings-q32023/). Verizon contributed 19 points to the Dow's 205-point gain and was the best performer in the S&P 500.


Small caps also made progress, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.8%. But growth stocks gave bears the bloodiest nose, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) surged 1.9%.


Economic Data, Earnings Boost Stock Market
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP102423-232x300.jpg)The Purchasing Managers' Index gave the stock market a boost when it was released Tuesday morning. The manufacturing index rose to 50.0 in October, above views for 49.5. It was also slightly higher than September's 49.8 reading. The services index rose to 50.9 in October compared to September's 50.1.


There was also positive news on the earnings front, with the likes of **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) popping on quarterly results. The fact that nontech earnings are showing strength is encouraging.


But **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) had mixed fortunes after hours following their earnings reports, with [Microsoft rising](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/msft-stock-microsoft-trounces-fiscal-q1-goals/) and [Alphabet skidding](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-beat-shares-fall-as-cloud-computing-growth-misses/). More Big Tech earnings loom, with **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) reporting late Wednesday and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) posting results Thursday.


And there is some economic data set to drop that could potentially spark a rally or send the stock market lower. The first reading of Q3 GDP is set to drop Thursday while the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is released Friday. The latter includes the core PCE reading, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation.

These Industry Groups Shine
---------------------------


The S&P 500 [sectors nearly all closed in the green](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Utilities and communication services turned in the most impressive gains. Energy was the only area to close lower.


As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered a more refined look at the day's action in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Integrated computer system stocks, dairy products plays, steel producers, shipping firms and database software stocks were among the top performers.


On the flip side, foreign banks, financial software firms, office supply companies, financial software companies and auto retailers all struggled. The hospitals group also had a tough session, driven by **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)) plunging 4.5% in high volume after Q3 earnings missed Wall Street views.

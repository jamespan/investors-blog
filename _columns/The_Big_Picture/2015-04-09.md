Stocks patched morning losses Thursday, as the indexes finished modestly higher. The Nasdaq rose 0.5% after being down as much as 0.5%. The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, but the small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.4%.

  

The IBD 50 added 0.3%.

  

Volume edged up on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE. Volume on the Nasdaq has been below average in each of the past nine sessions.

  

At this juncture, individual investors should stay focused on the market itself. Without a bullish tailwind, breakouts will have trouble building gains.

  

What are the chief characteristics of the current market?

  

• So far the market appears to be repeating a familiar pattern — moderate gains in the major indexes followed by small pullbacks that prepare the way for additional gains.

  

• Since July, pullbacks have lasted about five weeks. The current trouble dates to early March.

  

• The distribution-day count remains disturbingly high. While time has removed some days from the list, the load remains at seven apiece for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. (The S&P 500 shed its March 4 distribution day at Thursday's close because of time.)

  

• Volume generally has been stronger on the down days than on the up days, the opposite of what bulls prefer.

  

• Since the end of February, the best performers have been the IBD 50, up 4%; the Big Cap 20 Index, up 3%; and the small-cap S&P 600, up 1%. The S&P 500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq is flat in the same period.

  

• Breakouts in March and April haven't led to big gains. Of the three dozen breakouts among highly rated stocks, 36% are now below the buy point, 33% are still in the 5% buy zone, and 31% are extended.

  

Perhaps more telling, only 1 of every 7 breakouts is up 10% or more from the buy point.

  

Overall, the market doesn't inspire confidence.

  

Ideally, a more definite correction in the 10% to 20% range might leave stocks better positioned for substantial gains.

  

Yet bulls don't always get what they want. This market could continue to frustrate those looking for a tailwind.

  

Until things change, IBD-style investors should proceed with caution as they wait for a higher-percentage setup to develop.

  

In economic news Thursday, first-time jobless claims came in about 1% less than expected.

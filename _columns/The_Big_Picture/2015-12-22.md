Indexes Rise For 2nd Day, Seek To Extend Rebound
=================================================

The stock market climbed Tuesday, making another tentative step to bounce back from last week's two-day rout. The Nasdaq added more than 0.6%, closing just above 5000. That's a level of significance because the composite has managed to bounce back each time that it fell below it the past month.


The S&P 500 rose 0.9%. Thus far, it is holding above the 2,000 price level. But both indexes are trending downward, at least in the short term.


It was the second-straight moderate advance for the market, which is trying to regain its balance from Thursday's and Friday's beatings.


Indexes closed near session highs the past two sessions. That tends to be a positive sign, indicating that buyers didn't get their fill and will continue buying the next day. But last week, three straight days of bullish gains failed to sustain the market's advance.


The energy sector led the market as the price of crude oil came off an 11-year low. It was a minuscule bounce on the oil chart, but the broad indexes largely have shadowed crude prices. That helped explain the gains on Wall Street, which has come to view crude as a proxy for economic strength.


Volume fell across the board.


The IBD 50 lagged noticeably. It rose only 0.2%. There were no major sell-offs among the 50 stocks, but 20 closed lower.


It's hard to analyze the market in a week that will be cut short by the Christmas holiday, and a half session on Christmas Eve. Trading slows down this time of year although, near year-end, money managers get busy making last-minute portfolio adjustments.


Indexes may be trying to bounce back, but the charts so far have little to offer than just a starting point. The market remains under pressure; investors need to keep watching over their shoulders and avoid the dark alleys.

Even **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the prom queen of the technology sector, is bogged down in the lows of a 5-month-old consolidation.


Breakouts are struggling or up only a few percentage points from entries. A screen of recent breakouts shows that about 40% are below buy points and in many cases the breakouts were tentative â€” price and volume moves were unimpressive to begin with.


There are other indications that should not make investors fearful, but maybe a bit uncomfortable.


The Russell 2000 kept pace with the market Tuesday, rising 0.9%. But small caps in general have lagged for months. That leads to another uncomfortable indicator: Breadth is thinning. The advance-decline lines of the NYSE and Nasdaq are lagging the indexes.


For a higher day in the market, there were few leaders up in volume. In a positive sign, **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) managed to climb back above the buy point of last week's breakout.


Solar stocks sank. **SolarCity** ([SCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCTY)) and **Vivint Solar** ([VSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VSLR)) threatened to exit the Nevada market if the state cuts net-metering payments. Meanwhile, **SunEdison** ([SUNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUNE)) plunged 21% after its buyout bid for Vivint faced new challenges from an activist investor.

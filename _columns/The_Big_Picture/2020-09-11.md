  Will These Growth Stocks Outside Tech Take Over The Stock Market Leadership?

The most significant pullback in stocks in months continued for a second straight week as major indexes finished Friday's seesaw session with mixed results. Volume fell.




The Nasdaq has marked a rapid 11% correction from its all-time high. For now, IBD's outlook for stocks remains at "uptrend under pressure," something short of full correction status.


While the S&P 500 ended with a tiny gain of less than 0.1% on Friday, it still finished down more than 2.5% for the week. That exceeded a 2.3% drubbing in the prior week. The Nasdaq, as the leading index, has tripped harder. A 0.6% drop capped a 4.1% sell-off for the week.


A look at Friday's performance at an industry-group level reaffirmed the market's rotation. While shoe, homebuilding, metal ores, aerospace and railroad groups enjoyed bullish gains in the 1.7% to 2.6% range, at least 11 other industries toppled 2% or more. They included gaming, internet retail, enterprise software, automobile retail and medical software.


![MP091120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP091120.jpg)A weekly chart of the S&P 500 shows the large-cap benchmark finished the week mildly above its 10-week moving average. As seen in the final two weeks of June, the 10-week line can offer support when stocks need to take a break. A clear break of the 10-week line, just like what was witnessed in the final week of February as the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded, would tell a different story.


The Nasdaq finished Friday less than 1% below its 10-week moving average.


These Growth Stocks Pull Back Hard
----------------------------------


Meanwhile, all five of the FAANG stocks recently undercut their [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). IBD research has found that when this happens after the breakout has provided a fruitful advance, a leading stock is ready to take a break or form a new base. This is especially the case when the stock has also undercut the 50-day moving average and refuses to rebound quickly. Three of the FAANG firms have done just that: **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


**Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) finished the week further below their respective 50-day moving averages, a bearish character change. In a weaker market, breakouts usually fail. **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), unfortunately, demonstrated this. Shares in the database software titan and true market leader during the 1990s ended the week up 2%. But its move past what appears to be a long saucer did not last long.


That said, the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) exhibited newfound strength in nontech sectors. Roughly a dozen companies waged gains of 2% or more for the week. They included consumer spending and retail plays such as **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), deep-discount chain **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) and homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)). Coronavirus plays **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)), **West Pharmaceutical** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)) and **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) also rallied sharply for the week.


The Economy
-----------


The consumer price index rose 0.4% in August, beating the Econoday forecast of 0.3% month-on-month growth. This follows a 0.3% monthly gain in producer-level prices reported on Thursday. A bump up in inflation is likely encouraging for the Federal Reserve. However, yields on long-dated U.S. Treasuries edged lower Friday. That indicates Wall Street wants to see how the economy handles the ongoing health crisis.


The Dow Jones transportation average has held firmly in recent weeks and outperformed Friday, rising 0.9%. It marked a new 52-week high of 11,488 last week and trades less than 2% below that peak.

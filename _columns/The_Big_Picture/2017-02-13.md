Stocks Run Higher; Who Will Win The 2017 Derby? Apple, Cyclicals, Or Techs?

Are you in a betting mood? If yes, then which sector will take the crown in 2017?


![MP021317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP021317-149x300.png)Will it be the blue chips in the Dow Jones industrial average, led by its current powerhouse, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))? Or the ever-growing batch of tech companies that help keep Apple at the top of the global wireless and internet revolution?


Or will it be the "Make America Great" companies? You know, the ones that line the heavily cliched Rust Belt, as President Trump continues to meet with executives, issue executive orders and deal with Congress in an effort to boost manufacturing inside America's borders?


Or will it be foreign equity markets? The Dow Jones industrials are off to a fine start in 2017, up more than 3% since Jan. 1 and the Nasdaq composite is up 7%.


Yet Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark index is up 7.7% through Monday's action. The iShares MSCI Brazil ([EWZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWZ)) exchange traded fund is smoking hot, a 15.5% gainer since the start of the year.



In a nutshell, if the market continues to act the way it has since early November — that is, stage an advance by a large swath of equities in terms of industry, geography and market cap — then equities stand a good chance of pointing out that the U.S. financial and economic recovery since the Great Recession of 2008-2009 isn't dead yet.


Sure, numerous measures of investor sentiment still point to an above-average level of optimism. But rallies can last longer than anyone thinks. Doubting bears stand the highest chance of getting trampled.


On Monday, the Dow Jones industrials led the key indexes, thanks in large part to Apple and financial plays **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) (up 1.5%) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) (up 0.6%). The blue-chip average rallied 0.7% as seven Dow stocks were up 1 point or more.


Apple is up the most year to date among the blue chips, higher by more than 15%. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and Visa are each up more than 10%.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and NYSE composite each rallied around 0.5%. The Russell 2000 lagged, up less than 0.3%. Volume fell slightly from Friday's totals.


Indeed, the financial sector cannot be ignored. Wall Street firms, superregional banks, S&Ls and insurers rose decently Monday. Their gains have helped keep the NYSE advance-decline line on an upward path. (See the market indicator on the daily chart of the S&P 500 via the General Market Indicators page by clicking on the link at the end of this column.)


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line, meanwhile, has spiked into new high ground. Winners beat losers by a nearly 3-to-2 margin on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The raw number of stocks making new highs likely surpassed 550 stocks on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, and IBD's screened new high list (see the latest one via the [IBD Data Tables section,](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) underneath "Stock Lists" at Investors.com) will likely show a similarly high number.


The major indexes all continue to ride a nice air cushion over their 50-day moving averages, which in turn are leading their 200-day moving averages. This is classic bull-market character. Meanwhile, breakout failures remain few in number, and more stocks appear to be setting up potential breakouts. Big pullbacks in price by leading stocks have not been overly menacing.


Case in point: Commodity plays such as **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) and **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) are rallying back fiercely after testing the 50-day moving average. Steel makers in the U.S. got a boost by headlines hinting that Beijing is serious about clamping down on factory output in order to clean up its dirty air.


 On Feb. 2, U.S. Steel offered a secondary buy opportunity as it crossed back above the 50-day line near 34 in massive turnover, and on Monday broke out past a 39.24 buy point. Nucor cruised back above its 50-day line Monday. So long as a confirmed market uptrend remains intact, the flexible trader is willing to jump back into a stock a second or even third time if the first round trip was not so satisfying.
One piece of economic data that may have boosted the banks: the New York Fed said that its survey of inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 3.0% in January, up from 2.8% in December and 2.5% in November. The data further solidifies the Federal Reserve's changing stance on interest rate policy. Higher rates generally help most banks' margin on interest-rate-sensitive products.


Meanwhile, equity analysts at Birmingham, Ala., superregional lender **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) hold a bullish view on the tech sector.


"As earnings season comes to a close, our focus shifts toward the nation's capital, as corporate tax reform could potentially provide an additional tailwind for the technology sector," Brandon Thurber, research manager at Regions Asset Management, wrote in a note to clients.


"Broadly speaking, tax reform (lowering the corporate tax rate and the rate on repatriated earnings) could lead to an uptick in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a resurgence in share buybacks (least preferred given current valuations), and hopefully rising capital expenditures for technology companies."


Yet **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) gives investors ample warning to avoid chasing big winners. The stock was getting smoked again, showing the importance of looking for early-stage bases.


Monday, shares dropped 4.6% to 108.38, the biggest decline since Nvidia's wild reversal off a new all-time high of 119.93 on Dec. 28.
The emerging giant in semiconductors for the self-driving vehicle, data center and artificial intelligence markets is still above its 50-day moving average, and the stock is not really showing many telltale signs that its long-term uptrend is finished.


But its action in the final week of 2016, resembling a climax run, gave a big clue that a significant, healthy correction was long overdue.

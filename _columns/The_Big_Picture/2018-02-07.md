title: Techs Drag Nasdaq Down; Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?

The good news about Wednesday's session? We didn't see another swing of 1,200 to 1,400 points on the Dow, or a 4% move from intraday low to high on the Nasdaq.




 Yet stocks continued to flash signals of how the stock market of 2018 has already shaped up to be a completely different animal from 2017.


The Nasdaq composite gave up an intraday gain of more than 0.7% and ended the session 0.9% lower. Such price action is consistent with a market uptrend under serious selling pressure. IBD changed the outlook (as noted in the accompanying Market Pulse table) to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend" on Thursday last week, soon after the Nasdaq suffered two straight distribution days and its fourth such intense sell-off within the past 25 sessions.


Today, the distribution count stands at a lofty six days, and the average size of these declines is 1.4%.


The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.3%. No doubt, the Nasdaq indexes fell on the back of sharp drops in FAANG stocks, includingÂ **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), as well as renewed selling in former tech highfliers such as **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)).


IPG remains on the IBD 50 (No. 7 as of Tuesday's close) while Coherent and Lam have fallen off the [list of high growth companies](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Lately, more members of the IBD 50 have triggered sell signals.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.5%, a fraction of the 2.1% and 4.1% declines it suffered on Friday and Monday. However, go to a daily chart and you'll see that the large-cap benchmark turned tail after trying to rise back above the 50-day moving average Wednesday. Such resistance is not ideal. The Nasdaq composite suffered a similar negative reversal on Wednesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP020718-203x300.png)The Dow Jones industrial average edged less than 0.1% lower as some of its industrial and financial components advanced. In the broader market, strong gains by toy, RV, automaker, clothing, mortgage, retail apparel and cement stocks helped limit the indexes' declines. The Dow Jones transportation average gained 0.3%.


Another curious divergence within the market: more stocks actually gained than fell. Winners led by a roughly 15-14 margin on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Volume fell on both exchanges, but overall turnover was still well above average. Translation: selling is still heavy.


It's going to take time for investors to lick their wounds and for stocks to muster the strength to potentially make new highs. Only the Dow Jones utility average, nearly 16% off its high of 778, is currently in danger of going into a full blown technical bear market. The Dow transports has fallen 11% below its all-time peak of 11,423.


All in all, a correction at this juncture is very healthy for the long-term health of the market. A 9% decline for many of the major indexes is just what the market needed. The intensity of the sell-off was a great wake-up call. Sell signals need to be obeyed.


The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or the VIX, briefly pole-vaulted over 50 on Tuesday, its biggest spike since 2011. That year, coincidentally, was the last time we saw a 20% correction in the major market indexes, including the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


Back then, the global economic environment was totally different. The 10-year Treasury yield raced up from an intermediate-term low of 2.41% in October 2010 to as high as 3.75% by February 2011, before the Federal Reserve engaged in new strategies, including massive buys of Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities, to keep the cost of money at historic lows. But shaky finances and weak economic outlooks for Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Greece were high on investors' radar weighed heavily on U.S. stocks.


Today, the front burner issue is whether inflation will in fact accelerate sharply enough for the Fed to go faster than initially thought to raise short-term interest rates. A sudden rise would no doubt impact the U.S. economy in terms of borrowing and real estate values. Already in 2018, homebuilders have corrected sharply en masse.


The Dow Jones utility average, at 657, has now fallen 15.7% below its all-time peak. Today, just two companies make IBD's [Utility Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/utility-leaders-feb-07-2018/). All of the 12 names making the [REIT Leaders screen](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/reit-leaders-feb-07-2018/) currently trade beneath their 50-day lines. Almost all of them are struggling to keep their heads above their respective 200-day moving averages.


Rate-sensitive stocks are clearly lagging.


On Wednesday, Chicago Federal Reserve chief Charles Evans downplayed the need to urgently push the fed funds rate higher at least until mid-2018. "If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted," Evans, who was a member of FOMC interest-rate policy board last year, told Reuters.


Perhaps Evans' comments helped slow down the sharp rise in long-term rates. But on Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond still stood at 2.83%, up 78 basis points from the 2017 low of 2.05% and more than double from the multiyear low of 1.37% set in July 2016. Some observers believe that a rally past 3% in the 10-year yield would officially mark the start of a new bear market in bonds, following a three decade-long rise in bond prices going back to 1981.


Currently, the CME Fed Watch tool shows futures traders pricing in three quarter-point hikes in the fed funds rate by December. The current fed funds interest rate target range is at 1.25%-1.5%, and there's a 77.5% probability that the U.S. central bank will push the range to 1.5%-1.75% at the March 21 meeting under new Fed chief Jerome Powell.


Without surprise, optimism dropped sharply on the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter editors. At 54.4%, it's the lowest level since late September. The new reading also halted a streak of 16 consecutive weeks with bulls hitting the 60% level or higher.

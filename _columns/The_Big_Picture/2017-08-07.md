  Nasdaq Leads As Top China Names Flourish

With second-quarter earnings season winding down, some on Wall Street are wondering where the market's attention will turn next.




Clearly, the focus was on China Monday. The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising 0.5%, but there were plenty of explosive movers below the surface, particularly from China, ahead of busy week of earnings from several top-rated China names.


Gains in the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were more subdued at around 0.1% to 0.2% each, although the Dow managed to extend its winning streak to 10 sessions. Volume dropped 11% on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, turnover fell 10%.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) outperformed, rising 1.2%, while IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) portfolio at Investors.com outperformed the S&P 500 by around 200 basis points.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP080717.png)Headed into Monday, the IBD 50 was home to seven Chinese companies. Many were among the day's best percentage gainers, including **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), which jumped 4% to 100.33 ahead of its earnings report Wednesday before the open. It ended Monday's session still in buy range from a 97.89 entry and from a handle entry at 95.59.


**TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) and **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) were other top gainers in the IBD 50, rising 5% and 4%, respectively. YY reports earnings Thursday before the open.


Outside of the IBD 50, **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) tried to clear a 79.08 cup-with-handle buy point Friday but came up short due to light volume. Shares jumped 9.5% to 86.26 Monday in heavy volume. It also reports Wednesday before the open.


Elsewhere, **Bitauto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) soared 17% to 37.71. On a daily chart, Bitauto closed just above a 32.43 cup-with-handle buy point Friday. The weekly chart shows an alternate entry of 34.28. Whichever buy point is used, the stock is extended at this point.


In M&A news, **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) gapped down more than 2% on news that it's in talks to acquire **Rockwell Collins** ([COL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COL)). Shares of Rockwell soared 7% on the news, extending a rally that started last week. In April, Rockwell closed its acquisition of B/E Aerospace.


Headed into Monday, the Nasdaq showed four distribution days over a short period of time. The first one was on July 26 and the latest one on Aug. 3. When distribution days start to cluster in the indexes, it's a yellow flag to heed, but also remember that none of the four days had the feel of heavy institutional selling; far from it actually, because the worst percentage decline out of the four was 0.6%. Another day was a stalling session in which the Nasdaq edged higher. Stalling in an index occurs when volume is heavy but the index has problems making headway.


With second-quarter earnings season mostly in the rear-view mirror, the stock market's attention will likely turn elsewhere. The question is where? Back to North Korea, Russia and other areas of geopolitical risk? The Trump administration? Or back to the Fed, which appears ready to start unwinding its bloated balance sheet?


Wherever the market's attention turns, the major stock indexes don't appear to be worried about much at this point. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to trade tightly near highs and technical damage to leading growth stocks has been minimal. Still, complacency and excessive exuberance are worth monitoring because both have been seen in the past ahead of market pullbacks.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) looked like it was ready to take a breather in early July when it breached the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, but the stock quickly righted itself, and Tesla gapped above the 50-day line last week on strong earnings. Shares were unfazed by news of a $1.5 billion debt offering, falling 0.5% in light volume.

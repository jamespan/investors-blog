Stock Market Rally Missing Key Element; 3 Top Growth Stocks To Watch
=====================================================================

The major stock indexes rallied sharply Thursday, as Congress averted — at least temporarily — a showdown over the debt ceiling. Top growth stocks **Advanced Micro** **Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) traded near new buy zones as a rally attempt gathers steam.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market got off to a strong start Thursday, as Senate Republicans — headed by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell — offered to compromise on a short-term [debt-limit extension](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-seek-path-forward-on-debt-ceiling-around-republican-resistance-11633533425?mod=article_inline), pushing out a possible showdown over the debt ceiling until December.


"We have reached agreement to extend the debt ceiling through early December, and it's our hope that we can get this done as soon as today," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer commented midday Thursday. The Senate was set to vote on the deal late Thursday.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied 1% after surging as much as 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1% and the S&P 500 added 0.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP100721-269x300.jpg)Leading growth stocks sharply climbed as well, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.1%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)) raced 6% higher, breaking out past a 33.45 buy point in a choppy cup with handle. The 5% buy area goes up to 35.12.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 soon may be testing their 50-day moving averages as they continue to rebound from Monday's correction lows. Meanwhile, the Dow is already testing, but unable to claim, its own 50-day line.


That's a possible sign of resistance, and the way indexes pared gains also took away from an otherwise bullish session.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 could soon be making a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), which would be a bullish sign for the stock market. Watch for that signal. If it comes, higher volume will be a crucial element.


What To Do Now
--------------


As [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) has been discussing, investors need to be ready for the stock market to switch back to a confirmed uptrend, which would give investors the necessary green light to start buying stocks again. Make sure your watchlist is updated and you're ready to pull the trigger on potential breakouts.


Most importantly, be patient. If a new uptrend is real and meaningful, there will be plenty of time to make money.

Stocks Post Nice Gains, Regain Some Bullish Glow
=================================================

U.S. stock indexes returned to their upward path Thursday, ending three days of hesitant action.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%. All three marked new, all-time closing highs. The IBD 50 edged up 0.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the situation would be discussed at an informal OPEC meeting Sept. 26-28. Some market watchers remain skeptical because similar hints in the past have led to nothing.


Still, the oil explorer-producer industry group popped about 2.5% Thursday. Several climbed above buy points -- **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)), **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) and **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) -- but volume was pathetic in each case. A valid breakout comes in volume at least 40% above average.


The second factor Thursday was bullish action in the retail sector. Although price gains and volume were strong, most of the retail stocks were neither clearing bases nor close to highs. They have work to do on the right side of the charts.


For the session, the six biggest gainers in the S&P 500 were from the retail and apparel sectors. **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) jumped 17%; **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)), 16%; **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)), 7%; **Ralph Lauren** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)), 5%; **PVH Corp.** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)), 5%; and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), 5%.


Here again, these damaged stocks were not breaking out and aren't elite earners.


After hours, Nordstrom reported quarterly earnings that were about 20% better than expected. Revenue was slightly short of the mark, but apparently good enough for Wall Street's taste. Nordstrom zoomed 11% in after hours trade.


On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of the Census will release the July figures for retail sales. The Street is expecting a 0.4% increase, which would be the fourth improvement in a row. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge also will be reported. The Street is looking for a consensus reading of 91.


The current stock market looks different than it did nearly seven weeks ago. When the indexes bottomed on June 27, the leading sectors included gold and silver miners; utilities; food and beverage; and building.


Since then, utilities have dropped from No. 3 among 33 sectors to No. 9. The chip sector has climbed from No. 11 to No. 2. Software surged from No. 19 to No. 6. Meanwhile, gold and silver miners and building have kept their grips on No. 1 and No. 5, respectively.


Many individual investors are either fully invested now or at least have as much exposure as they want in this market. Yet, for investors hoping to add a stock or two, the leading sectors and industry groups are a good place to look.

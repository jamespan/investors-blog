  Stock Market Bulls Fight Off Bear Attack; These Groups Lead Charge

A late bull charge rallied to the aid of the stock market Friday, with most indexes finishing higher. But the bears did get their pound of flesh, mauling the Dow Jones Industrial Average.




The Nasdaq rallied out of the red to post a gain of 0.6%. This helped it avoid adding another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The S&P 500 also powered into positive territory, closing the day with a modest gain of 0.1%. It now sits just below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said a raft of negative economic data, including weakening manufacturing production and a drop in U.S. retail spending in December, had taken a toll on securities.


"Risk appetite did not get any favors from a raft of U.S. economic data that missed expectations, raising fears that the underlying recovery is vulnerable," Moya said in a note to clients. "The great cyclical rotation was reversed today and even though Treasury yields soared higher, tech stocks caught a bid."

The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ended up six basis points at 1.77%. The yield on the two-year note rose seven basis points.


Growth Stocks Flex Muscles
--------------------------


Growth stocks managed to finish the week with a flourish. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF turned in a gain of 0.8%. This helped it rise more than 1.2% for the week.


The index has work to do as it trades below its 50-day and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/) though. Look to see if the relative strength line can bend higher after coming under pressure.


Small caps also managed to squeeze out a marginal profit. The Russell 2000 ended the day up 0.1%, but a weekly drop of 0.8% leaves it languishing under its major moving averages.


Mixed Luck For Bank Stocks
--------------------------


A big reason for the Dow Jones' bad fortunes was the performance of **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), which ended the day down more than 6%, taking out the 21-day, 50-day and 200-day lines in the process.



It was hammered despite reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Friday.


"JPMorgan shares dropped sharply over fears that surging expenses and wage inflation may lead to a greater profit miss over the next couple of years," Oanda's Moya said.


Its fortunes contrasted with those of **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)). It managed to finish the session up 3.7% after posting better-than-expected earnings early Friday. It is currently extended from a 52.76 flat-base buy point.


The coming week is now key, as a raft of [banks and other financial companies are reporting](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/key-financial-firms-set-to-report-q4-earnings-as-sector-heats-up/) Q4 results as earnings season gets underway.


These Industry Groups Shine Brightest
-------------------------------------


A key detail for investors is the best performing industry groups on a given day.


On Friday it was oil & gas drilling as well as oil exploration & production stocks that stood out. Chip equipment stocks were also showing noteworthy strength.


On the flip side, consumer electronics retailers and wholesale jeweler retailers were given a beating. Health care commercial services stocks also suffered.

  Stock Market Dives Amid Surging 10-Year Yield; Nasdaq Battles Near 13,000

Sellers hit the stock market hard Tuesday, hurt by another surge in the 10-year Treasury yield, which hit a session high of 4.81%, the highest since 2007.




[Bond yields have been surging](https://www.investors.com/news/10-year-treasury-yield-surged-to-16-year-high-four-reasons/) as Wall Street frets about a resilient U.S. economy and the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. Rising interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar are two big impediments for the stock market currently.


Futures were fractionally lower just after 4:45 p.m. ET after the House voted to remove Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.9% and looks poised for another test of the 13,000 level. The Nasdaq undercut 13,000 last week but rallied off lows in higher volume, resulting in the first day of a rally attempt for the index. As long as the Sept. 27 low holds, the Nasdaq's rally attempt is still intact.

But it's a different story for the S&P 500, which fell 1.4% and undercut the Sept. 27 low, killing its rally attempt. The S&P 500 closed just above the 4,200 level, which happens to coincide with its 200-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 1.3% and closed 2 points above the 33,000 level. Small caps lagged again, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) down another 1.7%.


Market breadth was terrible again. Losers swamped winners on the NYSE by 5 to 1. The ratio was about 7-2 negative on the Nasdaq.


Weak breadth was on full display Monday even as major stock indexes pared early losses and closed near highs. The market-cap weighted S&P 500 rallied off lows Monday, ending mostly flat. But the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fared much worse, down 1.1%. The ETF lost another 1.2% Tuesday.


Still, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 oversold, along with the bond market, a stock market rally could happen at any time. Tuesday marked the fifth day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq. While a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) seems unlikely for the Nasdaq, they often happen when they're least expected.


For now, keep working on your watchlist while the selling runs its course. Buyers pushed **BellRing Brands** ([BRBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRBR)) higher during the final half-hour of trading. After hitting a high of 42, the maker of protein shakes has been showing uncanny strength, trading sideways while holding support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).



Selling picked up the pace Tuesday after the Labor Department's JOLTS report showed that job openings soared to 9.61 million in August. That was well above the 8.75 million consensus forecast. The Federal Reserve has made it clear it wants to see softness in the labor market to help it fight inflation. The job-openings data didn't help matters.


As it stands now, traders think there's a 31% chance that the Fed will hike the fed funds by another 25 basis points at the November meeting to a range of 5.50% to 5.75%. That's up from a projected 18% chance Friday. Even if the Fed stands pat in November, the chances for a December quarter-point hike are 45%, up from 35% Friday.

The next potentially market-moving piece of economic news will be Friday's jobs report. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls of 160,000, down from 187,000 in August. The Fed will be watching the report closely and does not want to see a number well above expectations.


Market Movers
-------------


The stock market seems to be going after every stock at this point, even those that had been holding up well.


Insurers tend to do well in a higher interest rate environment. But **Arch Capital Group** ([ACGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACGL)) lost ground for the third straight session and now tests support at the 50-day line. IBD 50 insurer **Goosehead Insurance** ([GSHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSHD)) lost ground for the eighth time in nine sessions. GSHD fell below its 21-day line and a 73.85 handle buy point.


Among oil refiners, **PBF Energy** ([PBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBF)) slid below its 50-day line, falling 5.5% in higher volume. It erased a double-digit percentage gain from a 48.52 double-bottom entry, good for [a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/amazon-stock-amzn-triggered-key-profit-taking-rule-before-flashing-sell-signals/). Fellow oil refiners **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) and **HF Sinclair** ([DINO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DINO)) also fell sharply.


**Dorian LPG** ([LPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPG)) flashed a sell signal by plunging through its 50-day moving average in busy trading, dropping 7.1% for the day. The breakout looked fine on Sept. 22. But sellers were in the stock Monday as LPG pared a 5.3% intraday gain to nearly nothing.


After a heavy-volume drop to the 50-day line, **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) plunged through last week's lows. In recent days, CELH had been rallying in light volume as it tried to retake the 50-day line. But it never made meaningful progress above the line, a sign that buying demand was drying up.


Meanwhile, after seven straight gains and a move above the 50-day line, **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) slumped 6.5% and closed below the line. Super Micro is in the IBD 50, which lost 2.1% Tuesday.

It was a good day for the bulls Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite recouped more than half of Monday's 1.4% decline. The stock market shrugged off news of fresh 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. It also looked past sluggish earnings reports from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)).




So why did the stock market rally? While the tariffs might have been less harsh than expected, the answer has more to do with market technicals. The Nasdaq has been getting support at its 50-day moving average since late June, and it showed supporting action again Tuesday, rising 0.8%. Volume on the Nasdaq came in slightly higher than Monday's level.


The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7%, marking its best closing high since late January. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) were top gainers, rising around 2% each. The S&P 500 picked up 0.5%. It's only 12 points from the all-time high of 2,916 hit last month. Growth stocks turned in a solid showing, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 1.3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP091818-201x300.jpg)Bond outflows also contributed to stock market strength Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked 7 basis points to 3.05%. The 10-year yield topped 3% in early August before backing off. Now that it's back above 3%, a move toward its mid-May high of 3.11% could be in the cards.


The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its key lending rate by another quarter point later this month to a range of 2% to 2.25%. According to [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/), there's an 82% chance of another quarter-point hike at the December meeting.


Nasdaq 100 Gainers
------------------


The Nasdaq 100 also served up plenty of winners, including **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Shares vaulted nearly 5% after the company showed well at Monday night's Emmy awards. Netflix tied with HBO for the most Emmy awards with 23. Netflix stock has been consolidating since June. There's no immediate entry for now as the stock sits 13% off its recent high.



Other top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 were from stocks that have been beaten down pretty hard in recent weeks. **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) jumped 4% ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. **Symantec** ([SYMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYMC)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) also outperformed, but both stocks are damaged good from a technical perspective.


The Nasdaq suffered a harsh distribution day Monday, falling 1.4% in higher volume. It was the index's fourth higher-volume decline since Sept. 4. That's noteworthy, but the market's resilience has also been impressive Also notable Monday was the weak action in leading growth stocks, particularly in the software sector. More than half of Monday's 10 worst-performing industry groups were software related.


But the selling in software stocks Monday did little to damage the charts of leading stocks. The charts of [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) remain very much intact. Plenty of other leading software stocks find themselves in the same boat. So it's too early to say that software stocks are on the verge of sharp pullbacks.


The price action of enterprise software name **Ceridian HCM** ([CDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDAY)) has been particularly impressive the past three sessions. The stock was featured in [IBD's Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-ceridian/) column just ahead of Friday's breakout. The stock followed through nicely Monday and extended gains Tuesday.


Railroad stocks outperformed Tuesday, but strength in **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) and **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)) wasn't much help to the Dow Jones Transportation index, which could only muster a gain of 0.4%. Union Pacific spiked 4.5% to a new high, helped by an upgrade from Loop Capital to buy from hold. Shares of Norfolk Southern rose 4%.


Several stocks in the energy sector got a lift amid rising oil prices. In the exploration and production group, **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) scored a new high and cleared the 40.58 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern. **Energen** ([EGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGN)) and **Centennial Resource Development** ([CDEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDEV)) also have been acting well.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude oil futures for October delivery settled at $69.85 a barrel, up 1.4%.

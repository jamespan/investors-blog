The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied more than 460 points Thursday, but tech stocks lagged. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) ended moderately higher after the artificial intelligence giant's earnings report, while **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) dived on a Department of Justice request for the tech giant to sell its Chrome browser.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the main indexes with a 1.1% advance, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lagged with a less-than 0.1% rise. But small caps outperformed as the Russell 2000 index jumped 1.7%.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with utilities, financials and consumer staples leading the upside. The technology, industrials, real estate and consumer discretionary sectors ended lower by modest amounts.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) were the clear winners Thursday, with gains of 3.6% and 3.1%, respectively. Sherwin-Williams alone gave the Dow 71 of its 461 points.


On the downside, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) sold off 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively.


All but one of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) dropped 1.1%. Late Wednesday, Nvidia [reported better-than-expected results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-wall-street-reactions-q3-earnings/) for its fiscal third quarter but its sales guidance for the current period was only modestly above views. Nvidia shares ended a volatile session with a 0.5% climb.


Alphabet shares dived 4.7% Thursday after the [Justice Department asked a federal judge](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-justice-department-chrome-sale-apple-search-payments/) to force the company to sell its Chrome browser and end payments to Apple in the companies' internet search deal, as part of antitrust legal remedies. Alphabet shares gave up their 50-day moving average line and the weakness spread to other tech stocks.


Meanwhile, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund advanced 3.1%. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), there were a number of big winners on the session, including **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)), which surged to new highs Thursday.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MP112124-217x300.jpg)


As the major stock indexes rebounded from their recent losses, IBD maintain its recommended exposure level at 80%-100%. So far, the indexes have successfully defended their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which are shorter-term support levels to watch.


As the stock market recovers, the environment continues to require diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). Make sure you monitor your positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured one new stock, **Procore Technologies** ([PCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCOR)), which broke out past a 74.11 handle buy point. Meanwhile, the Near Pivot list has only two stock ideas on it, and one is **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)).

Dow Jones Tech Titan Shows New Buy Point
----------------------------------------


Leaders to watch include Dow Jones giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and fintech leader **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)).



Apple stock moved down 0.2% Thursday and is 4% from a new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 237.49 as a result of a flat base. Shares are back above their 50-day line. A lagging relative strength line is an ominous technical indicator to watch.


Cybersecurity leader Cloudflare jumped 8% Thursday, breaking out past a 99.17 buy point in a cup with handle. It was the [IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cloudflare-stock-artificial-intelligence-crypto-bitcoin-developers/)


Tradeweb is attempting to break out past a 136.13 buy point in a flat base, but shares were turned away Wednesday.

Bulls Stay Long And Strong As Dow, S&P 500 Extend Win Streaks
==============================================================

It was another orderly day of trading in the major stock indexes Monday, a perfectly fine performance for the bulls after the Nasdaq composite jumped 3.4% last week in higher volume.




 The so-called FANG names  — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) **—** outperformed with gains ranging from 0.4% to 1.4%. Facebook and Amazon benefited from more positive analyst chatter. Amazon fared the best, rising 1.4% to 1,246.87, although it's important to note that the stock's breakout over a 1,213.51 buy point has come in mostly light volume.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 haven't closed lower yet in 2018. The Nasdaq added 0.3%, the S&P 500 gained nearly 0.2% and the Russell picked up 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Nasdaq volume rose and preliminary data showed volume on the  NYSE close to Friday's levels.


[A low distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) continues to work in the bulls' favor, with two on the Nasdaq and one on the S&P 500. It stands to reason that the less institutional selling there is in the market, the easier it is for stocks to move higher. As always, pay attention if the count starts to rise again and watch the price and volume action in leading growth stocks. For now, the market's message is crystal clear: It's OK to look for fresh buys.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP_010818-209x300.png)The Nadaq 100 performed in line with the composite, helped by strength in **Seagate** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Tesla jumped 6% to 336.41, closing just above the 200-day moving average around 332. The electric-car maker could be breaking out over a descending trend line, found by connecting the stock's recent highs. Breakouts over trend lines can present early entry points for aggressive traders.


Intuitive Surgical rose 3.4% to 391.86 as it works on a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) with a 415.15 buy point.


The market landscape is filled with no shortage of bullish stock charts, but the devil is in the details when it comes to separating healthy bases from ones that are flawed.


[IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), for example, broke out powerfully from a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 218.77 buy point. Shares jumped 3% to 222, but the breakout came from a later-stage base after a huge move already. Another flaw is that Nvidia's weekly chart shows a relative strength line that has yet to make a new high. It's good to see the relative strength line in new high ground at the breakout.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) and **Arista Neworks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) were big percentage gainers in the IBD 50, with gains of 9% and 6%, respectively. Universal Display cleared a risky late-stage consolidation with a 192.85 entry. Meanwhile, Arista's weekly chart might look like a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 buy point, but the base is only six weeks old — too short for a proper cup-with-handle pattern. Thus, it needs to be viewed as a cup without handle, with a 245.75 entry.


**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) rose 2.4% to 55.92 as it works on a cup-shaped base with a 60.99 buy point, but it's a late-stage base as well.


The IBD 50 turned in another solid showing Monday, rising 0.9%, after a stellar 2017.


In other news, the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference got underway in San Francisco Monday. Headline flow was busy, but it wasn't a good day for iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)), which ended at 108.37, down 1.3%. Health-care-related groups generally lagged Monday.


Biotechs were some of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100, with names like **Alexion** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) showing losses ranging from 2.5% to 5%.


Shares of **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) ended off lows but still lost 0.8% on news that it's planning to acquire San Diego-based Impact Biomedicines for up to $7 billion if certain milestones are hit. Impact is working on an experimental drug for a type of blood cancer called myelofibrosis.


Among the bright spots, shares of **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) gapped out of a flat base, jumping nearly 14% to 78.12. The midcap name has shown solid sales growth in recent quarters, but it's not profitable yet. The company's specialty is tubeless insulin pump technology.

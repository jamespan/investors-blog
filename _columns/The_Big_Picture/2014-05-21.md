Nasdaq Shows More Oomph, But Volume Still Bone Dry
===================================================

The major indexes posted their third gain in four sessions Wednesday, but trading remained lackadaisical on the whole.

  

Leading stocks joined the rally. The IBD 50 rose 1%. But only a few stocks have attempted breakouts. So far, they do not have much gains to show for. Rather, a larger contingent of names continues to build new base patterns.

  

Institutional-quality names, ranging from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) to **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) to **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) are all nowhere near proper IBD-style buy points. The silver lining for the bulls: It's nice to see companies that are posting solid growth and are excelling in exciting new industries to keep their declines relatively mild.

  

The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.8% Wednesday and finished nearly at its session high.

  

The S&P 500 also advanced 0.8%. Outsized gains by oil and gas, ethical drug, meat product, transportation gear, cement and automaker stocks helped boost the large-cap benchmark. All of these groups are ranked within the top 40.

  

On a weekly chart of the Nasdaq, you'll see the index making a genuine attempt to rally back above the 10-week moving average. Remember, the 10-week line is not exactly the same as the 50-day moving average on the daily chart on this page, but their functions are nearly identical.

  

During the 2013 uptrend, the Nasdaq had spent barely a week or two underneath the 10-week line. This year has been different. After suffering a 2.8% slide the week ended March 28, the key index continued to slump and eventually tested its 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average). It's now been eight weeks since the Nasdaq made that late-March drop.

  

Other aspects of the technical picture improved, at least for a day.

  

On the Nasdaq, winners edged losers by a roughly 3-2 margin. However, if the Nasdaq were to resume its place as the leading index of growth companies, it's going to have to end the diverging trend of rising while its advance-decline line continues to sink lower.

  

On the NYSE, winners beat losers by nearly a 2-1 ratio.

  

What else is running in the NYSE's favor? The fact that it's hosting more stocks that make 52-week highs vs. the Nasdaq. Take the IBD New High list in Wednesday's paper. On the NYSE, stocks making new highs totaled 49 while 35 hit new lows. On the Nasdaq, more stocks made new lows than new highs, 62 vs. 27. (See Page B5 for today's list.)

  

Investor sentiment remains robustly optimistic, at least among the pundits. The latest survey by Investors Intelligence shows bullishness rising to 57.2%. That's shy of this year's highest reading of 61.6%, yet still at a level where it's hard to conceive of a market posting a sharp upside follow-through and roaring gains in the near term.

  

Psychological indicators remain mixed, though. The CBOE volatility index is still at low levels, while the put-call volume ratio hasn't shown extreme movement lately.

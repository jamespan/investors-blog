  Nasdaq Leads Patchy Rebound As Crude Oil Nose Dives 5%; Is The Rally In The Magnificent Seven Over?

If you thought the Nasdaq and the rest of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) drew a mixed picture for a rebound, then you might even be more surprised — for better or worse — by a motley performance at the sector and industry-group levels.




On the bullish end, the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.4%. Ditto for the Nasdaq 100-linked Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF. You really don't expect such a gain when the stock market lies in correction status. Nonetheless, for an index that is desperately trying to hold the 13,000 level, Wednesday's rise after testing that level was a win.


Stocks got off on the right foot following a surprise on the jobs front. ADP reported that private-sector payrolls grew by 89,000 jobs in September. That missed the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 150,000. Some market observers have complained that the report can vary widely with government figures, which come out on Friday. Nonetheless, the increase even missed the lowest economist estimate of 102,000 net new jobs.


The rally also came amid some bargain hunting by bond investors.


Jobs, Bonds And Stocks
----------------------


After a harsh two-day sell-off, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 6 basis points to 4.73%. This is more significant than what your non-IBD-reading neighbor down the street may think.


As the payout for risk-free Treasuries has grown sharply since mid-July, so has the competition for investors' money in terms of equities. Even short-duration Treasury paper offers the healthiest returns in decades. On Wednesday, the 3-month T-bill presented a yield of 5.61%, according to U.S. Treasury data.


[(MarketSmith subscribers](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and Investors.com readers can view a chart of the 10-year bond yield by punching in zero-TNX.)


The Nasdaq's gain easily exceeded advances of 0.8% for the S&P 500 and 0.4% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Small caps, meanwhile, were listless. The Russell 2000 added just 0.1%. Yet to be fair, the index's reversal off an intraday low of 1709.59, in which it was down 1%, certainly added a bullish stroke to its chart.


Elsewhere, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) did not participate in Wednesday's Nasdaq-led rally. Yet after it made a similarly bullish reversal on Tuesday, rising 1.2% in volume that vaulted 252% above average in the highest trading so far this year, a 0.1% dip on Wednesday seemed acceptable.


Volume fell on both main exchanges vs. the prior session. Treat that as one disappointing checkmark on Wednesday's up session.

Underperforming The Nasdaq
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP100423-230x300.jpg)Another checkmark that would likely make you question the strength of the buying?


For starters, let's consider the day's leading industry groups.


Data as of 4 p.m. ET showed the minuscule dairy products industry group, with two members, leading the charge, up 5.8%. Meanwhile, just 13 additional industries beat the Nasdaq on Wednesday with gains of 1.5% or more. And what a mixed portrait of leadership. In the growthy area of the market, you have automakers (thanks to a revolutionary new product in electric vehicles) and semiconductor equipment. But cyclicals such as airlines, lodging, paint and cement and concrete outperformed as well. Super and mini market stocks also reinforced the defensive nature of the rally.


[IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) shows the final daily performance figures for all 197 industries tracked.


In the meantime, oil and gas stocks performed terribly.


Light sweet crude oil futures on the NYMEX dived 5.6% to $84.22 a barrel. That marked the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 30, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The sell-off also trimmed oil's year-to-date gain to 4.9%. An OPEC decision not to further cut production perhaps sparked the sell-off.


As the accompanying Market Pulse table shows, quite a few energy stocks have dropped hard enough to trigger profit-taking sell signals.


One example: refinery giant **PBF Energy** ([PBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBF)). The stock fell 7.5% in accelerating volume and [plunged further below the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/). That's sell signal No. 1.


Sell signal No. 2? After a decent run past a 48.52 buy point in an elongated double bottom, PBF has not only lost all of its 16% gain. The midcap stock has now fallen 7% below that buy point, triggering [the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Perhaps the drop in both crude oil futures and related stocks may be a blessing for both the economy and growth-stock pickers. While the Federal Reserve has shown laserlike focus on the path of wage and services-led inflation, it no doubt is also watching closely for any signs that above-normal increases in energy prices could upset the progress made in getting overall inflation under control.


On Wednesday, gasoline futures dropped 6.8% to $2.20, the lowest close since Dec. 19. Data from the EIA (Energy Information Administration) showed gasoline inventories soared by 6.5 million barrels in the latest report, vs. a 1 million barrel jump in the prior week.

Nasdaq's Future: Whither Go The Magnificent Seven?
--------------------------------------------------


Adding to the mixed picture of the Nasdaq-led rally? Few stocks are making new highs. This means that breakouts are still thin.


[According to MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the 10-day moving average of Nasdaq-listed stocks reaching new 52-week or all-time highs has fallen to 26. That's a terrible number compared with the 10-day average of new lows, which has lifted to 325, the highest level since last October. (Use the symbol NASDQ to see this graph, as well as NYEXG for the same data on NYSE-listed issues.)


Meanwhile, the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap techs did a lot of the day's heavy lifting. The average gain among this elite group of stocks on Wednesday was 2.1%. Could they help bring the stock market out of its funk?


Upcoming earnings and corporate outlooks will be a factor. So too will be what the market believes to be an acceptable premium to pay for high-growth stocks.



At 4263, the S&P 500 currently trades 17.2 times analysts' consensus 2024 earnings forecast of $247.49, according to data released Monday by Yardeni Research. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), meanwhile, at 305.58, is currently priced at 16.6 times its full-year 2023 earnings outlook of $18.33 a share and 14 times the 2024 EPS estimate of $21.76.


Meta remains a [half size position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


For sure, a strong future bull run rides the back of an expanding number of rising stocks. So, on the bright side, breadth in Wednesday's advance improved.


Data around the market close showed winners edging losers on the Nasdaq by a 4-3 margin. On the NYSE, advancing issues outmatched decliners 1,858 to 1,772, according to Thinkorswim.

Beyond Nasdaq: Bulls Vs. Bears
------------------------------


Among investor sentiment indicators, bullishness among market pundits fell again. The bullish ratio presented in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey sank to 42.3% vs. 43.7% a week earlier.


"This is now the fewest bulls since late winter, when they dipped just below 40% to signal a buying chance as the S&P (500) broke 3900," John Gray of Investors Intelligence wrote in Wednesday's report.


Bearishness among newsletter writers held unchanged at 23.9%. Gray notes that this is still higher than in late August, "when market strength trimmed them to just 18.6%. These editors hold lots of cash, generally still projecting a U.S. recession and issuing negative comments regarding the quality of the economic data."


[Friday's nonfarm payrolls report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) hopefully will provide more clarity on the economic picture for both the Federal Reserve and the stock market.

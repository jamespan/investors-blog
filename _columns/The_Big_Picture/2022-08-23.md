The stock market remains in an uptrend but pressure is building ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's key Jackson Hole speech on Friday.




The Nasdaq composite actually fared best out of the major indexes. While it disappointingly gave up slight ground after spending much of the session in positive territory, it still managed to close virtually flat. The key index remains down almost 22% so far in 2022 after ceding some of its recent gains after a blockbuster run.


The S&P 500 briefly flirted with a gain but ultimately gave up 0.2%. Early data suggests it may have avoided [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower NYSE volume.

Overhead supply seems to be an issue as both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have fallen away after approaching or touching their downward-sloping [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). Indeed both are now struggling to hold onto their 21-day lines.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was mixed, with a slight majority closing negative. Energy and materials were the best-performing areas. Health and real estate were the worst.

Oil major **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) fared best with a 3.2% gain while **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) lagged with a 1.9% dip.


Small Caps Gains But IBD 50 Leads Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


Tuesday was a day for small caps to shine. The Russell 2000 closed just below its 21-day exponential moving average after gaining 0.2%.


But it was left in the shade by the performance of the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which gained a meaty 1.6%. This helped the fund move above its 21-day line.


A healthy smattering of energy names helped the growth-oriented ETF outperform. In addition **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), its second-largest holding, roared more than 9% to an all-time high.


New Data Gives Powell Food For Thought
--------------------------------------


Powell's forthcoming speech is looming large over the performance of the stock market. New economic data added weight to the thesis the economy is slowing. Traders will be looking for signs Powell is willing to dial back on interest rate hikes, which would be a balm for underperforming growth stocks.


S&P Global's flash reading of manufacturing conditions fell to 51.3 in August from 52.2 in July. This was well below analyst expectations. The services measure fell to 44.1, the worst reading since May 2020.


In addition, new-home sales slowed to a 511,000 annual rate in July from a downwardly revised 585,000 in June. This was also well under expectations. Home sales were down almost 30% year-over-year.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya believes Powell has a tricky balancing act ahead.


"He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession," he said in a note to clients. "The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy."

Warren Buffett Stock Helps This Industry Group Shine
----------------------------------------------------


As ever, the performance of the 197 industry groups told an important tale.


On Tuesday, a periodical stocks, miners and security software stocks were among the brightest areas. A pop in oil prices also saw oil and gas plays flourish.



One of the top stocks of the day was **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)), a stock that has found fame as a new favorite of legendary investor Warren Buffett.


The stock staged a monster move for such a $69 billion-market cap stock Tuesday, jumping 6.9% in heavy volume. It is now extended past a cup with handle buy point of 66.26, [according to MarketSmith analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/). This still counted as a second-stage pattern, so further rich gains are possible.


On the other side of the coin, auto parts, telecom services, movies and water utilities all struggled.

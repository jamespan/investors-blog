Bears Crank Up The Pain, But Gold ETF Rises
============================================

Bears woke up, stood up and swatted stocks down Thursday, knocking the major indexes back under their 50-day moving averages.




The Nasdaq dumped 1.9%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.5%. Both closed below their 50-day lines. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, which is still above its 50-day line, and the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Gold was the only hiding place. The iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) rose 0.5%. The conservative utility stocks outperformed the market by losing less. The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.7%.


Market watchers blamed the carnage on political uncertainties in Washington, D.C., as President Trump and the Republican Congress seem incapable of avoiding distractions. The latest problem was a rumor thatÂ Gary Cohn, President Trump's pro-business advisor and director of the National Economic Council, was considering resigning.

The disbanding of two presidential business councils got plenty of attention Wednesday and Thursday, but it's unlikely it means anything beyond wounded egos.


A better way to look at Thursday's carnage is in the context of fund buying or selling.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, only two pegged slight gains. Confectionery foods and Canadian oil explorers inched up 0.2% each, according to preliminary data.


On the downside, the day's worst performers included airlines, data storage, dairy, steel and chip stocks.


This suggests that funds are doing some across the board lightening. Is it the beginning of more consistent selling and perhaps a market top?


Historically, market tops take longer to sketch than market bottoms. A top can take months. Take a look at the 10 charts on pages 214 to 217 in the fourth edition of "How to Make Money in Stocks." In most cases, the charts show resistance that is spread out over several months.


How should IBD-style investors play the current situation? Rules will guide the investor.


If an investor has a concentrated portfolio of five stocks, then exposure can be adjusted quickly. An investor might sell a stock or two to either cut losses or take profits. This puts more cash on the sidelines. From that position, the action of stocks in the portfolio and the action of the market can dictate the next step. Either it means ratcheting down exposure further or jumping back in on market strength.


Meanwhile, the diversified investor has a tougher time making decisions because one sale won't make that much difference to the portfolio. One additional advantage for the concentrated investor is that the trip toward the sidelines can feel much calmer than trying to adjust a complicated portfolio.


The key for the IBD investor is to let the market guide the investor's exposure.


Even though Thursday's action was ugly, few leaders dropped in strong volume. Among top-rated stocks, the show mainly involved China-based stocks. Retail internet play **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) gapped up 3% in strong volume on strong quarterly results. **China Lodging Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) gapped up 9% on earnings 20% higher than expected. Internet content provider **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) fell 0.8% as it continues to pull off a recent high.

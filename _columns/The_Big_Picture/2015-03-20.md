Stocks shifted into a higher gear Friday as the Nasdaq scored a new high.

  

The Nasdaq popped 0.7%, while the S&P 500 beat that with a 0.9% gain. The IBD 50 led with a 1.5% surge.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges compared to Thursday's pace. Friday was a quadruple witching day, which tends to inflate volume.

  

IBD's Market Pulse shifted to 'uptrend resumes.' Despite that, individual investors would be wise to be selective in their buying.

  

Questions linger because the S&P 500 failed to make a new high, and because the distribution-day count remains high.

  

Also, quite a few stocks notched new highs Friday and then retreated to close low in the day's range. They included **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) and **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)).

  

On the bullish side, far more stocks were acting confidently Friday. Take a look at the daily charts of **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)), **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)).

  

Each stock shows a nice gain, a high close and strong volume. It doesn't get much better than that.

  

Meanwhile, European worries appear to be on the back burner, but Greece hasn't disappeared.

  

As for international worries, most uptrends climb a wall of worries. Too much good news is when euphoria develops and becomes dangerous.

  

Still, with the distribution-day count remaining at five for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, reasonable people will wonder how this resumed uptrend will be able to stay on track. That's a valid concern. There are only three possible remedies.

  

First, time can erase distribution days. Yet, most of the distribution days are fairly recent. They won't even begin to expire until April.

  

Second, price gains can erase distribution. A strong rally would be needed, however, for that to develop.

  

Third, the indexes might grunt their way to higher ground despite the distribution. Earlier this year, the count reached as high as eight distribution days before the market rolled over.

  

To some extent, there is one more step that individual investors could take â€” search among foreign stocks trading on U.S. exchanges.

  

Last week, analysts at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based think tank, said that India is replacing China as the fastest-growing major economy. OECD said India will grow its economy 7.7% this year and 8% next year. Meanwhile, China is expected to slow to 7% growth in both years.

  

India has a more growth-friendly leader in Prime Minister Narendra Modi than is found in many Western countries. Also, India is dependent on oil imports. The drop in oil prices is helping the economy.

  

Among India stocks trading on U.S. exchanges, an India bank might be one way to play the trend. **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) has a best-possible 99 in EPS Rating, and the stock has pulled back close to its 10-week moving average.

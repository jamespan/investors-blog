The stock market rallied sharply Thursday after first-time jobless claims came in higher than expected. Amid a brutal year for tech stocks, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are set to finish 2022 with record yearly losses.




Meanwhile, three leaders to watch include Dow Jones stock **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) in the new stock market correction.


Jobless Claims, Earnings
------------------------


The Labor Department said weekly unemployment figures showed first-time claims rose to 225,000 vs. 216,000 in the previous week, higher than Econoday's consensus estimate for a rise to 222,000. Claims have been up and down in recent weeks, but generally trending lower since a mid-November high of 241,000.


The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.83%, snapping a three-day win streak. Despite Thursday's losses, the 10-year yield is still up sharply from its early December lows around 3.4%.


In a slow earnings front, chicken egg distribution giant **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) dived more than 14% in huge volume after reporting mixed fiscal Q2 results. The stock triggered the [7%-8% loss rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 62.74 buy point and broke down below its 50- and 200-day lines, underscoring the amount of risk in the current market.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP122922-300x262.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied more than 1% and the S&P 500 rose nearly 1.8%. The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 both advanced 2.6% each. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


Despite Thursday's gains, IBD's stock [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains at ["market in correction"](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bear-market-rally-loses-more-traction-coal-stocks-burned/) due to the amount of weakness in recent weeks. That means investors should primarily be on the sidelines in preparation for a new confirmed uptrend. Thursday was Day 1 of a new rally attempt, so a [potential follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom-this-signal-marks-all-major-lows/) could occur as soon as next week (Day 4 or later of the rally attempt).


For now, IBD readers should be diligently creating and maintaining watchlists. You can find many of the stock market's future leaders while the indexes are still weak, so now is the perfect time to find stocks separating themselves from the pack.


The best way to find emerging stock market leadership is by using theÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock lags the market, the line will point lower.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 1.1% Thursday as the ETF holds near its 52-week low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), payments leader **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) jumped 5.6% to reach its highest level since April, while **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) lagged sharply, falling 0.4%.



Notable 2022 Declines For Large-Cap Stocks
------------------------------------------


Large-cap stocks, especially technology names, were hit hard in 2022. Notably, Meta Platforms and Tesla are on pace for their worst yearly performances on record, while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is set to finish with its worst year since the 2000 dot-com bubble, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Other notable performances include tech titans **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which are on pace for their worst yearly performances since the 2008 financial crisis.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Caterpillar, Juniper Networks, Tenaris,
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Dow Jones leader Caterpillar is back above a flat base's 239.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) following Thursday's 0.3% rise. Bullishly, the RS line hit a new high this week.


Juniper Networks is adding a handle to a cup base that spans back to March, taking the buy point down from 38.24 to 34.05, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Juniper is a maker of computer network gear it sells to telecom service providers, large companies and cloud computing firms.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Tenaris is trying to break out past a 35.15 flat-base entry. Shares rose 1.4% Thursday to retake the entry. The RS line hit a new high this week. Keep in mind the weak stock market outlook means investors should avoid new stock buys.


Tenaris is the biggest provider of steel tubing for oil and gas wells, controlling nearly half the global market on almost every continent. It is also pursuing capacity expansions in North America and the Middle East. Full-year earnings are seen popping 130% to $4.27 per share in 2022, before slowing to 8% growth in 2023.

  Growth Stocks Take Charge In Bullish Week, Small Caps Energized By Jobs Report

Growth stocks retook center stage in a solid week for the stock market. And [Friday's monthly jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-solid-hiring-as-unemployment-jumps-sp-500-rises/) gave the latest evidence that monetary tightening has been working to cool inflation.




The mighty mites on Wall Street prevailed on Friday. The small-cap Russell 2000, up 1.1%, outperformed a 0.3% rise by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a gain of nearly 0.2% by the S&P 500. The Nasdaq lagged, which has been an unusual occurrence for most of 2023 after dreadful performance last year. On Friday, the composite index began the day higher but finished off 3 points, or way less than 0.1%.


Yet its weekly rise of nearly 3.3% turned out as the strongest weekly performance since a 3.4% lift in the last week of March.


A weekly chart also showed the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing neatly above its 10-week moving average for the first time in four weeks. The S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for the week, the Dow Jones was up 1.4%.


Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges vs. Thursday, heading into the three-day Labor Day Weekend.


So, while the 500 pulled off its intraday high on Friday, the lighter turnover indicated a lack of heavy institutional selling. On Thursday, the Nasdaq recorded a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/), a rare form of distribution, or pronounced profit-taking by fund managers; hence, the accompanying Market Pulse notched one distribution day.


A Better Environment For Growth Stocks
--------------------------------------


Longtime IBD readers know that when the major averages trade above their 10-week lines — or [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) on the daily charts — then individual investors stand a much better chance of making money in growth stocks.


[![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP_1x_090123-288x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP_1x_090123.jpg)The gain by small caps certainly was not without reason. Friday's jobs report showed an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 3.8% vs. 3.5% in July. Payrolls grew more than expected, rising by a net 187,000 jobs. But July's figure got a downward revision. Plus, average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 0.2% month on month (below the Econoday prediction of a 0.3% increase) and up 4.3% year over year (vs. an expected 4.4%).


Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist for Paris-based banking giant BNP Paribas, noted the payrolls report contained positive elements for the economy — namely, aggregate work hours went up, while more U.S. workers entered the workforce. However, other economic data released earlier in the week, such as a bigger-than-expected 0.8% monthly rise in consumer spending in July, still gives hawkish members of the Federal Reserve more ammunition to keep pressing for a higher cost to borrow.


Riccadonna thinks the Fed will pause on hiking the fed funds rate at its Sept. 20 meeting. How about one in November? "It's no sure thing, but the debate will certainly continue," Riccadonna told CNBC. He also pointed out that spending trends could hit "some headwinds in the fall," including the resumption of required college loan monthly payments.


Bond Yields Rise
----------------


On Friday, investors sold long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the key 10-year bond rose 8 basis points to 4.17%. That ended a four-session slide.


However, that did not stop the market from enjoying an excellent week of gains amid a Day 7 follow-through day that took place Tuesday.


Even among small caps, growth stocks led for the week. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) exchange traded fund rose 3.5%, significantly higher than a 2% bounce by iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)). IWF's 85 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) is superior vs. a 61 for IWD, too.


China equities also enjoyed weekly gains. SPDR S&P China ([GXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GXC)) has been a lagging ETF for more than two years. And its 4.7% gain for the week does not mean the bear market in China equities is over. However, [even the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) has included a few growth stocks from the world's No. 2 economy that exhibit virtually all of the fundamental, technical and fund ownership metrics typically seen in big market winners.



**Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)), [covered on IBD Live on Friday](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), is perhaps the best example among growth stocks in China lately. The EV innovator, up 7.8% for the week, is surviving a test of support at the 10-week moving average after a robust breakout past a trendline entry near 26 during the week ended May 12.

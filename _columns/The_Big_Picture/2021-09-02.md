The Nasdaq and S&P 500 eased from record highs Thursday but still closed higher in the wake of pandemic-low jobless claims. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a mild three-day losing streak.




Even though they closed off session highs, **Mercado Libre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) traded at or near new buy zones.


The stock market was higher out of the gate following the latest report on jobless claims. The Labor Department [reported jobless claims](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-09-02-2021-11630527461?mod=hp_lead_pos3) fell 14,000 to 340,000 in the week ended Aug. 28. That was the lowest level since the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March 2020. The [Econoday consensus forecasts](https://us.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.asp?fid=522818&cust=us&year=2021&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) called for initial claims of 350,000.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq slashed gains to 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.3% and closed in the middle of the day's price range. Both indexes hit new highs. The Dow climbed 0.4% and remains just off new highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 outpaced the other indexes, advancing 0.7% and moving further above its 50-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP090221-225x300.jpg)With a modest amount of institutional selling, investors should remain confident in the current uptrend. [Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-fades-this-industry-may-be-rotating-into-leadership/) cautioned the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at or close to touching their respective upper channel lines. A normal pullback would not be a surprise, and Thursday's uneven trading keeps that possibility alive.


Leading growth stocks showed strong gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.6%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)Â stock **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) jumped 5.7%. Shares are about 25% above a cup base's 191.99 buy point.


Elsewhere among market leaders, **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) traded right at buy points. **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) moved further past a new buy point and is in buy range. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) remains in buy range. **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) extended recent gains and is out of buy range. On the downside, **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) tumbled 5.4% despite [handily beating second-quarter forecasts Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/veev-stock-veeva-earnings-q2-2022/).


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Mercado Libre, Shopify
-----------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/leaderboard-10-year/) stock Mercado Libre decisively rose above its [cup-with-handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) 1,899.43 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) Thursday, rallying almost 2% even after paring gains. Leaderboard's analysis noted that continued improvement in both the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) and the relative strength line would bolster the chances of a successful breakout.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [MELI stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-mercadolibre-inc-meli.aspx) shows a modest 69 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Shopify is rapidly approaching a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) 1,650.10 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares cut gains to 0.2% Thursday. Positively, the stock's relative strength line is also on the upswing. The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day, confirming the stock as a market leader.

After two straight bullish gains for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, it wouldn't have been surprising to see some profit-taking Wednesday. That turned out to be the case, as sellers came into the stock market during the final hour trading. The main stock indexes closed with minor changes.




Small caps led the stock market Wednesday, with the Russell 2000 closing near its session high, up 0.4%. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 eked out 0.1% gains, while the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1%.


Wednesday's session had the feel of [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), but the S&P 500 avoided this type of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower volume. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but the index's modest decline prevented it from being a stalling session. Still, Wednesday's performance was a reminder that sellers are still lurking.


The Nasdaq got an early lift, helped by a strong showing from Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Shares gapped up and rose 7% after a breakout over an 1,843.93 buy point on Jan. 20.


![MP020321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP020321-229x300.jpg)But **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) reversed sharply lower despite strong Q4 results. Investors might've been spooked by news that CEO Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO later this year. But he's handing over the reins to Andy Jassy, who has led Amazon Web Services, the company's booming cloud computing business, since 2003. Amazon's chart is still intact despite a lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). It's above its 10-week moving average and only 7% off its high in a 23-week consolidation.


Stock Market Sentiment
----------------------


The bulls got a bit of good news from the weekly Investors Intelligence sentiment survey. Bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers fell to 57.8% after a small increase to 61.2% the prior week. Falling bullish sentiment is actually good for the confirmed market uptrend because excessively bullish readings above 60% have been seen near market tops in the past. The latest reading ended nine straight readings above 60%.


After two straight bullish gains for the major stock indexes Monday and Tuesday, the stock market is back in a confirmed uptrend, as the market shook off a rough week for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. IBD's market outlook on Friday was lowered a notch when the Nasdaq closed below its 21-day exponential moving average for the first time since the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on Nov. 5.


But the lowered outlook came amid a very light distribution-day count for the Nasdaq. The only distribution in the count at this point was on Jan. 27, when the index plunged 2.5% in higher volume. Three distribution days were removed from the Nasdaq's count on Jan. 20 (the declines on Dec. 23, Jan. 4 and Jan. 6) because the Nasdaq rallied 5% from the closing prices on those days.


Energy Stocks Lead Stock Market
-------------------------------


Oil and gas stocks were standout performers as the price of oil hit its highest level since January 2020. March crude oil futures settled at $55.69 a barrel, up 1.7%. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) added 4% as it finds support at the 50-day moving average. Another oil ETF, United States Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), is breaking out. After a series of tight weekly closes, it's up 6% so far this week.



Semiconductor stocks were notable laggards. After rising 5.3% on Monday and Tuesday, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave back 1.9%. The ETF softened more in extended trading, hurt by earnings sell-offs for Apple suppliers **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)).


After-hours earnings winners included Leaderboard stock **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), along with **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)).


Playing Offense And Defense
---------------------------


Wednesday's price action in the stock indexes means that a defensive posture still makes sense, despite the positive market outlook. The Nasdaq rose as much as 7% above its 50-day moving average. It closed 6.2% above the line, but it's still at a level where a pullback wouldn't be surprising.

With the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend, playing offense makes sense to some extent. Playing offense and defense in the current market environment isn't as hard as it might sound. Continue to look for actionable charts, and nibble when new buys present themselves. The market will tell you pretty quickly if you're timing was right.


But it also makes sense to watch profitable positions in your portfolio and look for sell signals. It might be a decisive break of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) or a move below the 50-day line.


Two Breakouts
-------------


After bullish breakouts Tuesday for **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Farfetch** ([FTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTCH)) joined the breakout ranks Wednesday. Shares rose 6.5% to 67, ending the day still in the 5% buy zone from the 65.64 buy point.



Farfetch made a nice stand at its 10-week moving average last week. Shares fell nearly 3% for the week, but the stock closed near its weekly high. The weekly loss at one point was 15%, but buyers came in and lifted the stock off lows.


At first blush, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 24 and [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 74 isn't the stuff of a [CAN SLIM stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/), but what Farfetch has going it for is big sales growth, along with outstanding fund sponsorship. An up/down volume ratio of 2.1 indicates strong demand for shares.


New issue **Yatsen Holding** ([YSG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YSG)) soared 17% to 22.20. It cleared an alternate entry of 21.76. But the Goldman Sachs IPO is prone to volatile swings, even with a large float of 291 million shares and average daily dollar volume of more than $80 million. The initial breakout for Yatsen came on Jan. 14, when it cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 21.10 buy point. But sellers smacked the stock lower the next day.

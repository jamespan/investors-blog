U.S. stock indexes posted notable gains Thursday, despite vigorous selling in the last hour of trade.




Gains in the past three days flirted with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/).


In rare instances, a follow-through day can come in just three days — when all three days have sharp gains — rather than the usual minimum of four.


The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% Tuesday and Wednesday and for a time seemed poised to deliver a much bigger gain Thursday. But it closed with a gain of only 1% after being up 1.6%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.9% Thursday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%.

Bears Crushed
-------------


The bears had nothing to cheer about in Thursday's session. They suffered a crushing disappointment in the past three sessions. The pessimistic camp once again failed to convince the stock market that the end is near.


Instead, the bulls added more conviction to their case.


This is especially surprising in light of the standoff with China. The current stock market is news-driven, but the indexes posted gains without any discernible change in the China situation.


What's going on?


New Secular Bull
----------------


Some market watchers are convinced that what's going on is a new, bullish secular trend.


O'Neil Capital Management's Senior Vice President and portfolio manager Mike Webster recently said the current market is "similar to June 1949, when the Dow began a 16-year major bull market." O'Neil Capital is a related company of IBD.


Such long trends are called secular bull markets. They can last many years. IBD and growth investors focus on playable rallies and periods to raise cash — all within shorter time periods.


In the May 6 IBD Weekly cover story, Webster said a [bull market that could last 12 to 16 years](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-outlook-2019-new-bull-market/) began in July 2016. It also could be pegged with the June 30, 2016 follow-through day.


Surviving Tariffs
-----------------


Yet, the current challenge for the bulls is how the market will survive President Donald Trump's tariff policies.


Since Trump's first tariff shot Jan. 23, 2018 — at washing machines and solar panels — the U.S. stock indexes have had trouble making progress.


Draw a horizontal line from Jan. 23, 2018 to the present on the S&P 500. The index shows no occasions when it rose significantly above the line and stayed there. The Nasdaq did better but still spent much of its time below the line.


Bull markets are known for climbing a wall of worry, and the current stock market has no shortage of bricks. Many market watchers are aware of the worry part but they wonder how and when the climbing part will resume.


Leading stocks were acting well Thursday, with software groups claiming six of the day's top nine industry groups. The highly rated software stocks seem to be saying their act isn't over. Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks took a beating. The chip sector was a leader not too long ago. But the sector has dropped to middle of the pack.


In a good sign for the stock market, new highs outnumbered new lows for the second day in a row, according to preliminary data.


Economic Data
-------------


Economic reports Thursday were generally above expectations.


First-time jobless claims came in at 212,000 vs. the consensus view for 219,000. Housing starts in April were about 3% better than expected. The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook gauge hit 16.6 in May vs. estimates for 9.3.


The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 1.6% Thursday. Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) added 1.4%. For the week, the two funds are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively.

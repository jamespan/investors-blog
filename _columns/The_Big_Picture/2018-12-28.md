Stock indexes found momentum in the afternoon Friday, but a last-hour reversal left the market narrowly mixed.




The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3% after being up 1%. The large-cap S&P 500 slipped 0.1%. Small caps in the S&P 600 gauge poked 0.6% higher, and the Nasdaq pegged a 0.1% gain.


Volume declined on both major exchanges.


For the past two sessions, the indexes have protected Wednesday's 5% to 6% dash.

Niche indexes were mixed. According to preliminary weekly data, the Dow Jones Utility Average fell 1.4%. But the Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 4.2%.


Light sweet crude oil dropped 2.1% for the week. Crude has fallen in 10 of the past 12 weeks.


Dow Jones Battered
------------------


Blue-chip losers in the Dow Jones outnumbered winners by about a 10-3 ratio Friday. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) posted a 0.8% gain. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fell 1.4%.


Top gainers in the S&P 500 included chip-equipment maker **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), up 2.6%; **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), up 2.3%; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), up 1.1%; and **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)), up 1%.


With the semiconductor equipment group 38% off its high, chipmakers 25% off and chip designers 19% off, the chip groups have plenty of chart repair to do.


Former market leader Amazon.com is in a 27% deep hole. Amazon's last breakout was in April. Although the base was sixth stage, the breakout worked — rising about 27%.


Amazon's base count is back to first stage. The chart, though, has work to do on the right side.


Chipotle Mexican Grill is an ex-leader that could be ready to lead again. The Street expects earnings to rise 29% in 2018 and 40% in 2019. Chipotle could be working on a double-bottom base.


Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett vehicle, is 9% off its high. The relative strength line for the diversified operations stock is at a high, which is bullish.


How To Play A No-Breakout Uptrend
---------------------------------


The kind of stocks Buffett favors haven't escaped damage. Top holdings **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) have taken hits.


IBD-style investors should stay alert for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). Given the scarcity of breakouts, bulls might lack stocks to buy.


If breakouts are scarce in a new uptrend, one way around it is [IBD's ETF Market Strategy](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/market/etfmarketstrategy), which involves indexes. A bull could buy an index ETF and then exit the ETF when breakouts start to appear.

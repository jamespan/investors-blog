Stock Market Rallies As Fed Strikes Dovish Tone; Breakout For Adobe
====================================================================

The stock market ended with modest gains Wednesday, a good performance for the bulls, as the [Federal Reserve's policy statement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-cuts-ready-to-act-dow-jones-rises/) didn't contain any surprises. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) was one of the leaders in the Dow Jones, up 1.2% to 140.92, but it's still below a 142.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




As expected, the Fed kept its key lending rate unchanged at 2.25% to 2.50%, but a quarter-point cut at the July 30-31 meeting is now baked into the market. Traders see an 84% chance of another quarter-point cut at the September meeting, with possibly one more before the end of the year. A dovish Fed statement came on the heels of comments from European Central Bank Chief Mario Draghi Tuesday, who said that more stimulus is a possibility for the eurozone economy.


The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 2.09%, up three basis points before the statement was released, but fell to 2.03% as of 5 p.m. ET.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP061919-243x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of 0.4%, the S&P 500 added 0.3%, and the Dow Jones industrials inched up 0.1%. Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed NYSE volume higher than Tuesday's levels.


Bearish talk is still out there, mostly due to uncertainty about China trade talks and a worldwide economic slowdown. But the stock market's message is clear: It's still too early to give up on the market uptrend that was confirmed by the Nasdaq on June 7.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The stock market's reaction to the Fed policy statement was just what the bulls wanted after solid gains Tuesday.


Stock market bulls got a nice surprise Tuesday when a fresh round of institutional buying sent the Nasdaq composite to a 1.4% gain. The index showed bullish action, with a gap above the 50-day moving average. It briefly topped the 8000 level but backed off, closing in the bottom half of Tuesday's range. Overall, it was a good session for the bulls amid a big rally in [semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news).


The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 4.3% Tuesday, and edged higher Wednesday, but bullish charts in the group are hard to find. The exceptions are [Leaderboard](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=Leaderboard_FreeAccess2019&intcode=Skin|skn|LBFree|2019|06|lb|na|625082&src=A00541A) stock **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Brooks Automation** ([BRKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKS)).


The Nasdaq is up 20% year to date, helped by continued strength in [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/). When the stock market pulled back last month, many software names came down to their 10-week moving averages and found support.



Shares of **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) jumped 5.2% to 291.21. It's trying to clear a flat base with a 291.80 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Late Tuesday, the software giant reported its 16th straight quarter of 20%-plus sales growth. CEO Shantanu Narayen said Adobe's recent acquisitions of Marketo and Magento are helping the company attract new customers.


In the enterprise software group, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is still in the 5% buy zone after a breakout from a flat base with a 281.84 buy point. Meanwhile, other leaders in the group like **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) are finding support at their 10-week moving averages.


The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) ended near its session high, up 1.5% to 218.29.


In the health care space, **Iqvia** ([IQV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IQV)) broke out of a cup-shaped base, jumping nearly 6% to 154.24. The buy point was 146.20.


ETFs On The Move
----------------


Meanwhile, two interest-rate-sensitive ETFs went in opposite directions Wednesday.



The iShares Russell 1000 Finance ETF ([IWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWB)) ended at 162.08, up 0.3% in the stock market today. But iShares U.S. Home Construction ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) slumped 1.1% as it tests support at the 50-day moving average.


China Stocks Perk Up
--------------------


**New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) is just above a 92.95 entry, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far. Group peer **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) has been working its way higher as it carves the right side of a cup-shaped base with a 39.60 entry.

**Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) is also in position for a breakout try over a 49.20 buy point, while **JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) is holding above a 21.90 entry after a breakout from a 14-week consolidation.

It's still within the 5% buy zone. **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), meanwhile, continues to show bullish action after a breakout from an IPO base with a 91.56 buy point.

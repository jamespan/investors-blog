  Stock Market Enjoys Further Gains As Beaten Down Sectors Rally; Has Correlation Between Stocks And Bonds Broken?

The stock market has generally treaded water in recent days, with some indexes showing the muscle to hit all-time highs and others staying in the back seat. Overall, the confirmed market uptrend remains healthy, with IBD's recommended exposure at the highest 80%-100% level.




That exposure was at 60%-80% before IBD made the upgrade last week.


Meanwhile, certain correlations continued to get warped.


The S&P 500 rose mildly, up 0.3%, lagging a nearly 0.4% gain in the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed just 0.2%. It masked the rally of at least 10 of the 30 components that advanced 1 point or more and the drop of at least 2 points by **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) (a [short sale position in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/shortsales)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), [which held its annual developers' conference](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-aapl-wwdc-2024-ai-strategy/) with new product and technology announcements.


Volume was mixed in the stock market. On the Nasdaq, trading picked up more than 9% vs. Friday. But NYSE turnover cooled.


Stock Market Today
------------------


While the major stock market benchmarks rose mildly, so too did the yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond. In recent years, stocks and safe-haven bond yields tended to move in opposite direction. The period from July to October 2023 is a fine example. The Nasdaq suffered three waves lower of selling. Amid this stock market sell-off, bonds sold off too. The yield on the 10-year bond lifted from a July 20, 2023 low of 3.73% to a significant peak of 4.99% on Oct. 19.


How about now?


From a Feb. 1 low of 3.81%, the 10-year note's yield jacked up to as high as 4.73% on April 25. True, yields have faded some since then. Yet that sharp rise in yield of course cannot be ignored. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) managed to advance 3% over the same time frame.


Plus, since late April the ETF has tacked on nice gains. At 535, it's trading nearly 31% above the Oct. 27 low.

Other sector indexes did much better. Utilities Select SPDR ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) rallied 1.2%. Again, this appeared odd in light of a very strong gain in the energy market. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures ramped up more than 3% on Monday to $77.86 a barrel, less than a week after OPEC+ nations decided to extended existing production cuts.


Elliott Letter Boosts This Sector
---------------------------------


Transport firms went up despite a strong day for oil. Fuel makes up a large part of their operating costs.


The Dow Jones transportation average rallied 0.8%. This in part got sparked by **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), a laggard in the stock market over the past few years. Southwest received a critical letter from activist firm Elliott Investment Management that reportedly [owns $1.9 billion worth of shares](https://www.investors.com/news/southwest-airlines-stock-elliott-management-stake/) in the discount airline. Elliott called out Southwest CEO Bob Jordan for being in the helm amid seven negative revisions in sales and earnings guidance over a 17-month span.


Elliott also made suggestions in its letter to the Southwest board that it says could boost the stock by 77% over a year.



Southwest shares gapped up at the open and sprinted as much as 9% ahead. It made a three-month high. No new buy point is apparent yet. A 26 Composite Rating out of 99 headed into Monday's stock market open means it has plenty of room for improvement.

Beyond The Stock Market
-----------------------


Metals also performed very well following some rough action in recent weeks.


Copper futures jumped 1.5%, while silver rebounded 1.4%. Gold futures limped just 0.2% ahead.


These instruments should also move after the Federal Reserve releases its latest decision on monetary policy on Wednesday. While the central bank is not expected to change the fed funds rate from its current range of 5.25%-5.5%, keep an eye on [May U.S. consumer prices on Wednesday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and the producer prices index on Thursday. Both come out before the stock market opens each day.

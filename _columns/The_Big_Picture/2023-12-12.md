The stock market showed no quit Tuesday, as the major indexes climbed to their highest levels in at least 20 months. Big caps and the IBD 50 outperformed.




With friendly inflation data at their back, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 climbed for the third straight day. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to its highest level since January 2022. The Nasdaq added 0.7% and reached its highest since April 2022.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% Tuesday and is just 221 points from a record high.


Indexes initially had a sober response to the November consumer price index, which was in line with expectations. It was one of the last pieces of inflation data before the Federal Reserve announces its policy at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday.


Stock market investors expect the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged. More important will be Chair Jerome Powell's outlook and the Fed's own [projections for 2024 interest rates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-may-throw-this-curveball-for-the-sp-500-10-year-treasury-yield/). Investors know all too well, a single quote from him can turn the market sharply.


One reason for the stock market's heady uptrend since late October is the growing feeling that interest rates aren't going any higher, and rate cuts may start as early as next spring. The Fed has repeatedly said it won't consider rate cuts until it sees a sustained drop in inflation.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP121223-246x300.jpg)The 10-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 4.2% Tuesday.


Volume fell on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from Monday's totals. Declining stocks beat out advancers on both major exchanges.


The IBD 50 index rallied nearly 1%, outperforming the major indexes on the stock market. **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) and **GitLab** ([GTLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLB)) rose more than 3%.


Small Caps Lag The Market
-------------------------


If there was a weak spot Wednesday, it was small caps. The Russell 2000 fell 0.1%. Also, the S&P Midcap 400 index eased 0.2%, as buyers favored large caps. As proof, the Vanguard MegaCap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) jumped nearly 0.6%.


Meanwhile, most Magnificent Seven stocks contributed to Tuesday's gains.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) regained the 192.93 buy point of last week's breakout. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is finding support at a rising 12-day exponential moving average. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) jumped nearly 3% with continued support at its 50-day line. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) added more than 2%.


But **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) fell 0.6% after a jury ruled that [Google holds a monopoly](https://www.barrons.com/articles/google-epic-games-apple-big-tech-stocks-5b0aa49e?mod=hp_DAY_Theme_1_1) in its app store's distribution and payments market. The stock spent a second straight day below the 50-day average.


When Will Stock Market Pull Back?
---------------------------------


The major indexes have already climbed six straight weeks, and with each week the question of when the next pullback is coming grows larger. Yet, the stock market uptrend continues unabated.


For weeks, the stock market has made a mockery of resistance levels, overbought indicators and other reasons to believe indexes are headed for a pullback. But far from making an act of contrition, the market just keeps partying.


It's led to an interesting time in stock market psychology, with investor sentiment in full holiday cheer.


The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX for short, fell to 12.07 Tuesday. The so-called fear gauge made its lowest close since January 2020. It almost dipped below 12.0, which would have marked its first move below that level since Nov. 27, 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Breadth continues to improve, buttressing stock market gains. The NYSE advance-decline line is nearing the year's best level. The Nasdaq A-D line still lags, however.


In index funds,Â ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF ([NOBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOBL)), known for high-quality holdings, broke out of a cup-with-handle base.

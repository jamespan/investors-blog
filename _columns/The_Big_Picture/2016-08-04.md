Quiet Day For Bulls, But Chip Index Is Bright Spot
===================================================

Stock indexes stayed close to the break-even line Thursday as volume cooled.


The Nasdaq crept 0.1% higher while the S&P 500 rose even less. The Philadelphia semiconductor index served up the biggest gain, 0.9%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Big moves were scarce, but two stocks gapped up in strong volume and one gapped down. Fast food chain **Jack in the Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK)) leapt almost 11% in heavy volume on strong quarterly results. **Rice Midstream Partners** ([RMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMP)) jumped 5% on better-than-expected earnings.


**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) gapped down to a 5% loss on mediocre July closings. The stock, though, rebounded off its 50-day moving average and trimmed the session's opening 10% loss.

After a 13% gain from a late June low to Monday's high, the Nasdaq has found resistance at 5200. The S&P 500 rose 9% in the same period but has found resistance around 2175.


Even though the Nasdaq's recent action looks somewhat different from the S&P 500's chart, they share one thing in common: resistance. How will that resistance be resolved?


There is no shortage of market commentators offering grand opinions on what the market's next move will be. However, individual investors should remember that no one knows the future. It's best to tune out the noise and stay focused on the price and volume action of the indexes.


What are the indexes telling investors now?


The Nasdaq has had five days in above-average volume in the past eight sessions. Four of the days were up days with closes bullishly high in the range. One day was a down day with a close low in the range.


The Nasdaq's 50-day and 200-day lines are both tilting upward, a good sign. For short-term traders, who often focus on the 10-day line, the Nasdaq has closed above that line every day since June 30 and that line is also rising.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is rising, another good sign.


The S&P 500 has had only two sessions in above-average volume recently. One was a down day, and one was an up day. Both involved closes mid to high in the daily price range.


Its 50-day and 200-day lines are tilted upward, but the short-term 10-day line is acting as resistance.


Crude oil is one of the factors that has made life tougher for the S&P 500 than for the Nasdaq. The energy weighting of the S&P 500 is about 8%, whereas the Nasdaq composite's energy weighting is less than 1%. With the price of oil about 8% off its mid-July close, the S&P 500 is stuck dragging an anchor.


Economic news was a mixed bag Thursday. The Bank of England cut rates for the first time since 2009. First-time jobless claims were worse than expected. Factory orders for June were not as bad as expected.


**Coming up**: The monthly report on July payrolls will be released Friday before the stock market's open. Analysts are expecting nonfarm payrolls of 185,000. So far this year, payrolls have topped expectations four times and missed three times.


What effect did that have on the market on the day of the report? The indexes moved up with the beat and fell with the miss in five of the seven cases. In four of the seven cases, gains or losses were sizable. In three cases, they were modest.

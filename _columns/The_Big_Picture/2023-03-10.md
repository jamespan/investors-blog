Bank Crisis Worsens Stock Market Losses; What To Do Now As Indexes Lose More Key Levels

Worries over a banking-sector crisis overshadowed the monthly employment report Friday, sending stock market indexes down sharply for a second straight day.




The past two sessions have been fraught with troubling signals, which has caused a rethink of current market risk.


The 200-day moving average, which had acted as a life raft for the main indexes, is leaking. The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average sank deeper below those would-be support levels Friday.


In a day of broad losses, the S&P 500 surrendered nearly 1.5% and the Nasdaq fell 1.8%. The latter closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Jan. 19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%. It was the worst week for the S&P since September, and for the Nasdaq since November.


The small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 3.2%, weighed by dozens of regional banks. There was no safety in leading stocks. The IBD 50 tumbled 3.5% and ceded 6.4% for the week.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq.

And after Friday's sell-off we've cut our outlook further, to "market in correction." This requires investors to avoid any stock purchases and pivot to defensive trading, such as taking profits and [cutting losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Investors should reduce exposure to a range of zero to 20% for now.


CPI Report Could Be Key For Stock Market
----------------------------------------


Looking ahead, the consumer price index comes out [Tuesday morning](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Any disappointment could spark more selling. But a positive surprise could have the opposite effect. At any rate, it is the next big milestone for the stock market.


Sentiment gauges finally showed that investors are getting panicky, and that may be what the market needs to bottom out.


The [Cbeo Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), better known as the VIX, surged nearly 12% Friday, rising to more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. Historically, such spikes mark stock market lows. Keep in mind that similar signals in August and September didn't bring the market out of its slump. A June 13 signal worked better, however.



The put-call volume ratio spiked above 1.25, indicating excessive fear among investors. This too can signal at least a short-term low in the indexes.


Banking Crisis Worries Stock Market
-----------------------------------


Banking stocks continued to sell off after **SVB Financial**'s ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) liquidity crunch led to the bank's collapse. Regulators Friday [shut down its Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.investors.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-liquidity-crisis-sends-shockwaves-through-financial-industry/) after a run on what had been the bank of choice for tech venture capitalists. Deposits dwindled as rising interest rates dried up deals and clients burned through more cash.


SVB's collapse is the second largest FDIC-insured bank to fail after Washington Mutual's collapse in 2008, according to Dow Jones Market Data. SVB had $212 billion in assets; Washington Mutual had $307 billion, or $420 billion adjusted for inflation.


Investors rushed for havens, including Treasury bonds. TheÂ 10-year Treasury yield plunged 23 basis points to 3.70% late Friday. It was the largest one-day drop since Nov. 10. The yield is now testing the 50-day moving average.


U.S. [payrolls rose 311,000 in February](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-soft-wage-growth-offsets-strong-hiring-sp-500-futures-rise/), above estimates. But the unemployment rate rose to 3.6% and wage growth slowed. Stock futures rose in premarket trading following the data, but soon started falling in regular trading.

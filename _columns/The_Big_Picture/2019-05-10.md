Bears Roar Early Friday, But Then Bulls Take Over And Win Ugly
===============================================================

In the stock market, it isn't always so important where indexes are as how they got there.




Friday's session demonstrated the difference.


Bears hammered the indexes in the morning, driving the Nasdaq down as much as 1.9%. But bulls took over in the afternoon, erasing all the losses.


The Nasdaq closed 0.1% higher after whittling away all of the early loss. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4% while the small-cap Russell 2000 tacked on 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.

Winning Ugly, Bullish Details
-----------------------------


Overall, the day had a winning-ugly tone. Yet chart readers found some good signs in the details.


For example, the S&P 500 staged bullish action, closing high in the day's range. Trade was above the highs and below the lows of the previous session, an outside day often seen as a continuation pattern.


The Dow Jones showed similar action, as did the Nasdaq.


Another positive sign was the closes above the 50-day moving average for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Tariff Factor
-------------


The catalyst for the wide swings was uncertainty about U.S.-China tariffs. President Trump cranked up the tariffs on China, and Beijing threatened to respond.


Both sides appeared determined to avoid losing face, though the stock market would probably accept any deal right now. The reality can't be priced into the market until investors know what the reality is.


Negotiations in Washington, D.C., paused without an agreement. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called the day's talks "constructive." Liu He, the top negotiator on China's team, said the session went "fairly well."


Why News-Driven Is Bad
----------------------


While the indexes' bounces were encouraging, investors can't lose sight of the fact that the problem for bulls and bears alike is that the market is news-driven.


Only additional news can force a U-turn in a news-driven market.Â Neither earnings nor technicals can undo the news when news is the dominant factor.


The put/call volume ratio has been rising, but hasn't yet reached a close above 1.15, according to preliminary data Friday. Readings at that level often identify a short-term low in the stock market. More mayhem may be needed to get to that level.


Another factor to consider is new highs vs. new highs. On Thursday, IBD's combined new highs and lows tally showed more lows than highs, not what bulls want to see. According to preliminary data Friday, combined new lows again outnumbered new highs.

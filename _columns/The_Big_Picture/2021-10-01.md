Stock Market Rallies In Light Volume, Capping Ugly Week For Growth Stocks
==========================================================================

A rough week for the stock market ended with solid gains Friday after a spate of distribution days and bearish action knocked the stock market into a correction. Volume fell sharply from Thursday's levels.




Sentiment was positive after money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 6 basis points to 1.47%.


Small caps led the way, with the Russell 2000 up 1.7%. For the week, the Russell lost just 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrials jumped 1.4% Friday, the S&P 500 rallied 1.1% and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Breadth was positive on the Nasdaq, with advancing stocks beating decliners by less than 2-to-1. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by nearly 4-to-1.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP100121-300x264.jpg)Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) boosted the Dow Jones industrials after the company reported positive data for a Covid pill. A late-stage trial showed the oral antiviral treatment reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by around 50% in Covid patients. Merck, which jumped more than 8%, is developing the drug with privately held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.


High-profile Covid-19 vaccine makers like **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) and **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) plunged on the news, along with **Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)), which slumped nearly 12%.


Travel-related stocks had a good day on the Merck news. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) popped 3.1%, halting a four-session slide. IBD's airline group rallied around 5%.


Oil and gas-related groups were also among the day's best performers. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 3.4%. Materials and financial stocks also did well.


In general, leading growth stocks had a terrible week, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) down 8.7% for the week. But the fund pared a 3.9% loss Friday to less than 1%, with 20 components up 2% or more. The ETF found support at its 200-day moving average.

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD put its market outlook at correction after another weak close Thursday that saw the Nasdaq composite suffer its fourth straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). The warning signs had been out there for a while, including a rising distribution-day count. But one day of market strength does not a new uptrend make. The stock market still needs to prove itself more.


With the stock market in a correction, avoid the temptation of buying stocks in a down-trending market. There will always be stocks showing strength, but a weak market can eventually bring everything down with it. If market conditions continue to improve amid renewed signs of institutional buying, new setups should emerge. A confirmation of strength could come as early as next week.



Pay attention to stocks that have held up well during the selling like **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)). The company priced a share offering on Sept. 22 at 272 and the stock continues to trade well. In a healthy market, the stock would be buyable after a solid test of its 10-week moving average. Among recent IPOs, **Global-e Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) is consolidating near its 10-week moving average and still has the look of an emerging leader.


Two fertilizer stocks led the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com). **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) jumped out of a lopsided [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy volume and scored an all-time high. Group peer **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) rallied nearly 6%. It's near the top of a cup base, although an early entry was seen when the stock broke out over a trend line on Sept. 23.

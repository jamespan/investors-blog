  Indexes Look More Like A Bear Market After Recession Fears Spark Another Sell-Off

It's feeling more like a bear market, after the U.S. stock market plunged anew and indexes threatened to make new lows for the current correction.




Oil prices topped $130 a barrel earlier Monday and settled with a 3.2% increase to $119.40 a barrel. That's the highest close since September 2008, and the rapid rise in crude raised worries the critical commodity will help cause an economic slowdown.


The Nasdaq composite plunged 3.6% to its lowest close since almost exactly a year ago. Its decline from the Nov. 22 peak of 16,212 now exceeds 20%, or what is normally considered to be a bear market. Small-cap indexes, including the Russell 2000, already hit that correction zone in late January.


By that measure, it is the first bear market since the March 2020 Covid-19 plunge. IBD doesn't make a distinction between correction and bear market in its [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) because in either case, investors need to sit in cash.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP030722-199x300.jpg)The Nasdaq is only 243 points away from undercutting its Feb. 24 low. The S&P 500 tumbled 3%, its greatest one-day drop since Oct. 28, 2020. Another 2% loss and the S&P will also have taken out its February low.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended at its lowest level since March 2021 after sinking 2.4%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE as well.


Rally Attempt Nearly Dead
-------------------------


Once indexes undercut the Feb. 24 lows, the [rally attempt](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) is done. To be frank, that technical signal seems to be just a formality. The stock market shows no appetite for risk and the main pain points — Russia, inflation, rate hikes — show no sign of diminishing.


The IBD 50 lost 2.4% Monday. Off more than 30% from its peak, the IBD 50 also can be deemed to be in a bear market.


**Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) was a bright spot in the IBD 50 after it broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/getting-the-dub-recognizing-the-double-bottom-base-pattern/) with a 226.41 buy point in heavy trading.



In A Bear Market, Be Suspicious
-------------------------------


Breakouts, however, have low credibility right now, unless you're talking about metals, energy, fertilizer and some other materials stocks. That's the only game in town, as surging commodity prices enrich shareholders in those sectors.


With fuel prices soaring, travel stocks sank. IBD's airlines industry group was the weakest of 197 groups, down 13%. Casino and travel booking industry groups fell 9.6% and 9%, respectively.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) added 1.5% to mark another new high. It's up 37.5% this year so far.


Recession Fears In Stock Market's Mind
--------------------------------------


Just as American consumers are getting over the omicron flare-up, they are faced with steep gasoline and fuel costs. The average price for regular unleaded [topped $4 a gallon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-surge-in-gas-prices-isnt-slowing-down-11646627663) and hit a record high. Inflation certainly is not limited to gasoline, and the higher cost for consumers has brought the "R" word — recession — back into Wall Street's thinking.


LPL Financial on Monday cut this year's U.S. GDP growth forecast from 4%-4.5% to 3.7%. "The risks are to the downside," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said in a note explaining the move. The Fed may err on tightening too fast, while the commodity spike and other factors drag U.S. growth. But LPL did not mention any chance of recession right now.


The U.S. stock market Monday followed other global indexes in posting sharp declines.


London's FTSE 100 fell 0.4%, extending a now three-day decline to 6.3%. Germany's DAX slid 2%, hitting a 52-week low. It also made its three-day slide 8.3%. For both the FTSE and DAX, it was the largest three-day drop since October 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The CAC 40 Index fell 1.3% as it also made a third straight decline. The three-day, 7.9% drop is the largest since March 2020.


Tokyo's Nikkei 225 hit a 52-week low after it plunged 2.9% Monday. Its two-day rout exceeds 5% and is the largest since May 2021. The Shanghai Composite tumbled 2.2% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng plummeted 3.9%, its biggest single-day drop since July 27. Chinese equities have been locked in a much deeper bear market for months.

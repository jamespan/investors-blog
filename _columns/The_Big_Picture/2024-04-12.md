  Stock Market Falls Amid Iran Fears, Bank Reports; Retail Sales. Netflix Earnings Next.

The stock market ended Friday trading firmly lower amid fears Iran may attack Israel and disappointing bank earnings. New retail sales figures and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) earnings are among the events to watch out for in the coming week.




Of the major indexes, the Nasdaq composite was hammered the hardest as it plunged 1.6%. This caused it to suffer a drop of 0.5% for the week, its third weekly decline in a row. It has now fallen below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), but it's holding above the 50-day line. Even with this decline, the tech-heavy index remains up nearly 8% for the year.


The S&P 500 finished off session lows, but still fell 1.5%, its worst day since January. It has reversed below the 21-day line and is testing support at the key 50-day moving average. While it fell 1.6% for the week, the benchmark index retains a 7.6% gain so far in 2024.


Decliners led advancers by about 5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and exceeded 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq exchange. Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.


Dow's Worst Week Since March 2023
---------------------------------


Small caps were mauled, the Russell 2000 diving 1.9%. But it was growth stocks that got the most painful spanking from the bears, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) plunging 2.7%.


While IBD raised the market outlook to a confirmed uptrend yesterday, Friday's negative action came as an expectation breaker. Instead of turning in further gains the market shifted lower and suffered more distribution. Leading names also were hit hard.


It's unusual to change our market outlook and exposure level so quickly, but the market signals cannot be ignored. So we are back at "uptrend under pressure" and have reduced recommended exposure back to the 40% to 60% level.


Banks Disappoint; Retail Sales, Netflix Next
--------------------------------------------


Earnings season kicked off with aplomb Friday, but stock market investors were disappointed. Bank stocks disappointed by serving up weak outlooks and highlighting rising costs. Dow Jones stock **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), a leader in the money center banks industry group, flashed a sell signal by gapping below the 50-day moving average in high volume.

Investors will be hoping this is not a harbinger for things to come. Streaming giant [Netflix is reporting earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/netflix-stock-q1-earnings-asml-tsmc-chips/) Thursday after the close while the likes of chip-equipment play **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) are among other key names on deck in the coming week.


There also will be a bevy of economic data reports in the coming week. U.S. retail sales figures are due before the open Monday while the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which details regional economic conditions across the 12 Fed districts, comes Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell plans to take part in a moderated discussion on Tuesday.


These Stock Market Areas Fare Best
----------------------------------


Every [S&P 500 sector closed in negative territory Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Materials, technology and consumer discretionary took the worst of it. DefensiveÂ  plays in consumer staples and utilities held up the best.



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's industry groups offered more insight into the action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Oil-and-gas realty trusts, food wholesalers, homebuilders and cable stocks were among the strongest performers.


On the flip side, database software firms, computer hardware stocks and newspaper plays suffered most on the stock market. Semiconductor manufacturers also lagged.


Further, computer networking firms had a tough time on the stock market, dragged down by the performance of **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). It flashed a sell signal by gapping below its 50-day line after Rosenblatt Securities cut its rating on the stock to sell from buy.

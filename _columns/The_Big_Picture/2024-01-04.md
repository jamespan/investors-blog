  Nasdaq, S&P 500 Extend Losing Streaks; Pivotal Jobs Report Next

The stock market tried to rebound Thursday, but that faded as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 extended their losing streaks. Now Wall Street will shift its attention to Friday's pivotal December jobs report.




Early Thursday, the ADP employment report showed an increase of 164,000 jobs in December, above the 115,000 estimate and up from November's 103,000 gain. Also, the U.S. Labor Department said the number of initial unemployment claims surprisingly plunged to 202,000 from 218,000 in the previous week. They were expected to edge lower to 217,500.


Both reports showed signs of resilient labor demand. In response, the 10-year Treasury closed at 3.99%, its highest close since Dec. 13.


"Short- and long-term interest rates rose modestly following the releases, due to that belief that the Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting rates in the short term if the labor market remains strong," said Sam Millette, fixed income director at Commonwealth Financial Network, in a note to clients. "With that being said all eyes will be on tomorrow's nonfarm payrolls report to see if headline job figures in December follow a similar pattern to ADP and initial claims."


Meanwhile, the Labor Department is due to release a jobs report Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. That report is expected to show an increase of 158,000 jobs for the month, down from November's 199,000 increase. The unemployment rate is expected to tick higher to 3.8% from November's 3.7%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The major stock indexes finished mostly lower Thursday, as the session's midday rebound faded in late afternoon trading.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP010424-240x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a meager gain, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3% to extend its losing streak to four sessions. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined nearly 0.6%, making it five consecutive down days. Lastly, the small-cap Russell 2000 inched lower.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session, which means the Nasdaq and S&P 5oo both avoided new distribution days. Still, the continuation of the recent weakness bears monitoring.


Inside the Dow, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) was the session's biggest gainer, with a 1.9% advance. Shares are building the right side of a cup base with a 119.65 buy point.


On the downside, **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) plunged more than 5%, sharply off the session's lows, after the company's earnings report.


And top growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.9%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) rebounded 3.9%, ending a three-day losing streak. Still, the stock is about 2% below a 139.85 cup-base entry.

What To Do Now
--------------


With the stock market continuing its recent pullback to kick-start 2024, IBD recommends an exposure level of 60% to 80%.


Many leading stocks are breaking below the 21-day exponential moving average, which is a short-term sell signal that can offer an opportunity to take some profits.


Further, there is a scarcity of new breakouts among leading stocks, which makes sense as top growth names mostly pull back.


A great resource for finding daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points. In Thursday's list, there was just one breakout: Novo Nordisk.


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)) is approaching a 158.47 cup-with-handle entry.

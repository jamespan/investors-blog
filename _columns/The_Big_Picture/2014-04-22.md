The stock market rose broadly Tuesday, building on its weeklong rebound.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 made it six gains in a row. The composite added 1% and the S&P 500 0.4%, although both shaved some gains in the final hour-and-a-half of trading. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.2%.

  

Volume increased, adding to the positive tone of the day.

  

Indexes have been rallying for about a week now, closing each of the past five days near session highs. That's a sign buyers perhaps haven't yet had their fill.

  

Breadth was solid, with advancers beating decliners by more than 5-to-2 on both exchanges.

  

But while the market rebound has been robust, there is still no clear confirmation of the current rally attempt. Market price and volume gains so far haven't been strong enough to conclude that a shift in market direction has occurred.

  

It may seem odd right now to handle the market at arm's length, yet some caution wouldn't necessarily leave you out in the cold.

  

While some high-rated stocks are in buy areas, there are also a number of other leading stocks forming bases. Those offer the potential for opportunities that could be exploited. Some leaders are just now starting to form the right side of bases, so it could be weeks or months before a buy point develops on those charts.

  

One cloud over the market is that institutional buying is not showing up in the indexes' Accumulation/Distribution Ratings, as seen on this page. They've been stuck at the lowest-possible level even while the market has been rebounding.

  

But there are examples in history when weak Accumulation grades didn't stop the market from starting an uptrend. More important is the price and volume behavior of the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which would spot a follow-through.

  

The IBD 50 jumped 1.8%; its one-week advance has easily outpaced the broad indexes.

  

The medical sector led the market Tuesday, as news of a major buyout bid stimulated the sector.

  

**Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) soared 15% after the drugmaker got an unsolicited offer valued at around $47 billion from **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) and hedge fund Pershing Square. Valeant shares vaulted more than 7% as both stocks saw huge volume.

  

Other biotech and pharmaceutical leaders that rallied were **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)), **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) and **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)). They climbed 4% to 5%. Besides health care, solar energy, auto and software stocks led the market Tuesday.

  

Since the lows a week ago, those industry groups have been among the ones performing best.

  

Scores of more earnings reports are coming out this week, and they are a major influence on today's market.

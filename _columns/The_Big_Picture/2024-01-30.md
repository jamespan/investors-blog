Technology and small-cap stocks bore the brunt of selling in the stock market Tuesday. But several financial stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average helped boost the blue-chip index to a gain of 0.35% by the close




The Dow Jones was buoyed by strong performances from **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), which rallied 2% and 1.7%, respectively. JPM stock is holding above its 10-week line after clearing a cup base in mid-December. GS stock is also getting support at its [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) as it sits near the top of a lengthy consolidation.


**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones today — extending their post-earnings rallies — with gains of more than 1%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 held up well, down less than 0.1%, despite earnings sell-offs for **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) and **Whirlpool** ([WHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHR)). Weakness in these names was offset by big earnings gains and breakouts for **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)).

Losers had a slight edge over winners on the New York Stock Exchange.


Oil giant **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500, down 7%. Several stocks in the oil and gas sector sold off sharply after the Saudi government ordered state oil company Saudi Aramco to halt plans to expand its oil production capacity to 13 million barrels a day. The news reverberated through several oil and gas-related industry groups as WTI crude oil futures settled at $77.81 a barrel, up 1.3%.


The machinery/equipment group gave back nearly 3%, with **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) taking the hardest hit, down 12.5%. The field services group fell around 2%, weighed down by sharp losses for **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) and SLB.


The Nasdaq composite gave back nearly 0.8% but avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower volume. The Russell 2000 small-cap index also fell 0.8% after a short stay above the 2000 level.


AMD Earnings
------------


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) was one of the worst decliners in the Nasdaq 100 ahead of its [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-chipmaker-guides-below-views-for-q1/) after the close. AMD stock fell 3% during the regular session and fell another 2% in early after-hours trading. Like many of the Magnificent Seven stocks, AMD is overbought based on its stochastic oscillator, a momentum indicator.


Decliners beat advancers by nearly 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.


Making money in the stock market is trickier now than it was in early November when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 confirmed new uptrends with follow-through days. That's because there's no shortage of stocks extended past proper buy points.


At this point, look for stock market leaders pulling back to their 10-week lines for the first time after breakouts from bases. It's still OK to look for base breakouts, just make sure that the stock breaking out is a leader in its group, not a second- or third-tier stock.


**NVent Electric** ([NVT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVT)) is still in a buy zone after clearing a 59.58 entry. In the insurance sector, **Manulife Financial** ([MFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFC)) is still in a buy zone after a first test of its 10-week line.


Stock Market Earnings
---------------------


After the close, Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) kicked off a busy week of Magnificent Seven earnings reports. Alphabet was down more than 4% in after hours trading after fourth-quarter advertising revenue came in just below expectations, while Microsoft eased 1%.

Results from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) will be out Thursday after the close. Meta is a member of the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio.


Meanwhile, the electronics contract manufacturer group jumped more than 5% as investors cheered profit reports from **Sanmina** ([SANM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SANM)) and **Celestica** ([CLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLS)). Earnings and revenue declined from year-ago levels at Sanmina. But the results were better than expected, and the company guided fiscal second-quarter results above expectations. Celestica's results also topped expectations and its first quarter outlook was strong.


Group peer **Flex** ([FLEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLEX)) cleared a trendline with earnings due Wednesday after the close.


Bond Yields
-----------


Bond yields stayed in focus as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway. After a sharp drop Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield extended losses and closed below all of its moving averages. Just after the stock market close, the yield was down 5 basis points to around 4.04%.


The Fed meeting concludes Wednesday with the release of the Fed policy statement at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to leave its key lending rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5%. The first rate cut by the Fed could come as early as the March meeting with more cuts expected after that.

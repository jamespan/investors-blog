Stock Market Weakens After Walmart Profit Warning; Attention Turns to Fed, Tech Earnings
=========================================================================================

Sellers hit the stock market Tuesday amid a flurry of negative headlines, including a [profit warning](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-walmart-dives-on-lowered-profit-outlook/) by **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and job cuts at **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), which blamed a slowdown in its [e-commerce business](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-looks-for-2023-payoff-from-investments/).




Technology stocks were the hardest hit, fueling a 2% decline for the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)). But the ETF added 0.5% in extended trading after **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reported earnings. Microsoft pared an early loss in after-hours trading. Alphabet jumped nearly 3%.


Investors sold **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) hard during the regular session ahead of earnings report later in the week.


After getting turned away at the 32,000 level Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held up relatively well, down just 0.7%, despite a decline of nearly 8% for Walmart. It could've been worse for the blue-chip index if not for earnings gains for **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)). McDonald's is near the top of a 30-week consolidation. Coca-Cola gave an aggressive buy signal with a gap above its 50-day moving average.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) also outperformed in the Dow Jones, up 0.4%, helped a strong earnings report from group peer **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)).


Walmart's warning fueled selling in other discount retailers like **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)). Out of the three, BJ stock turned in the most resilient performance, paring a 5% drop to 1.9% and finding support around its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). BJ's is featured in today's Stock Market Today video embedded in this story.

Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps held up relatively well, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) down just 0.6%.


After getting turned away at the 4,000 level last week, the S&P 500 fell nearly 1.2% and closed less than 2 points above its 50-day line. Security software firm **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) was one of the worst performers in the index, down nearly 8%. Preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE, giving the index a distribution day.


The July 12 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the count because of a 5% increase from that day.


Software stocks were weak across the board, including the security software group, which fell around 6%. **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) slumped 9% after BTIG downgraded shares to neutral from buy. Sellers also hit **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) after Truist Securities maintained an overweight rating but lowered the price target to 140 from 170.

The selling was most concentrated in the Nasdaq composite, which dropped 1.9%. But breadth wasn't too bad with declining stocks beating advancers by about 3 to 2. The ratio was about the same on the NYSE, with losers beating winners by less than 2 to 1. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the index a distribution day.


Stock market risk remains elevated with a slew of high-profile technology earnings reports due this week. A healthy cash position still makes sense in the current market with no shortage of damaged stocks charts not much in the way of buy prospects and plenty of uncertainty.


GDP Data
--------


Later this week, investors will be watching Thursday's first reading on second-quarter GDP. The economy contracted at a rate of 1.6% in the first quarter. The Econoday consensus expects Q2 GDP growth of 0.5%. Meanwhile, the inflation component of Friday's personal income data will be closely watched.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eked a small gain, helped by a strong earnings report from **Graphic Packaging** ([GPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPK)), which jumped 4.5%. It's less than 2% off its high as it forms a shallow cup base.


Investors sold bonds early as the two-day [Federal Reserve meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-brace-for-a-splash-of-cold-water-for-dow-jones-rally/) got underway. But the 10-year Treasury yield closed well off lows after falling to around 2.71%.

The stock market is widely expecting a 75-basis-point hike by the Fed when the policy statement is released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The September meeting's rate outlook is still a moving target, although the odds for another 75-basis-point hike have faded.


Elsewhere, oil prices reversed lower after the Biden administration released another 20 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $94.98 a barrel, down 1.8%.


Natural Gas Spikes Again
------------------------


Meanwhile, natural gas futures spiked another 3% amid supply concerns. The U.S. Natural Gas Fund ([UNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNG)) rallied for the ninth time in 10 trading sessions but closed near its session low. It's near the top of a V-shaped cup base, but after three straight weekly gains and another one taking shape this week, it's best to wait for a pullback before buying.



[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) broke out of a downtrend with a move above the 140 level. Now it has its sights set on its June 7 high of 146.35.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Agilon Health** ([AGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGL)) bounced off its 21-day exponential moving average after sellers hit the stock hard Friday. The weakness came after AGL topped a 27.22 buy point.

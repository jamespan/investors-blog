  Stock Market Sinks Again; Small Caps Hit Hard As Nasdaq Stays In Distribution Phase

Sellers swarmed around tech stocks and small caps in the stock market Wednesday as the confirmed uptrend came under more pressure.




The minutes from the late-July Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. There wasn't much new, although the minutes revealed that committee members are concerned about stubbornly high inflation and that more rate hikes may be needed.


Federal funds futures traders expect the Fed to stand pat at the September meeting, leaving the fed funds rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.25. Odds for a quarter-point hike at the November reading have risen slightly to nearly 40%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 1.2% and took out Monday's low, bringing a trip down to its June 26 low into play. Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1.


Volume rose again Wednesday, giving the Nasdaq its fifth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in 11 trading sessions. When distribution days start to cluster, it usually causes problems for an uptrend.


The S&P 500 fell 0.8% after closing just below its 50-day line Tuesday. Similar to the Nasdaq, advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a nearly 3-1 ratio. Volume on the NYSE came in lower than Tuesday, so the benchmark index avoided a distribution day.

Top performers in the S&P 500 included insurance stocks like **Progressive** ([PGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGR)), **Allstate** ([ALL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALL)) and **Brown & Brown** ([BRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRO)).


After slumping more than 3% Tuesday in heavy volume, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) extended losses and is very close to a test of the 50-day line. Meanwhile, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) is testing its converged 50- and 200-day moving averages and holding support so far.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up relatively well compared with the rest of the stock market, down just 0.5%. **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) outperformed in the blue-chip index. But TRV stock is on a downtrend, stuck below all of its key moving averages.


The Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) closed just below its 50-day line after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in mid-June.


Headed into Wednesday, IBD's recommended stock market exposure was 60% to 80%. In light of Wednesday's weak session, exposure should be lowered to 40% to 60%.


A market under distribution is not the time for new buys. While the oil and gas sector continues to present interesting setups like **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)), new buys should generally be avoided. If you do buy, understand that gains can evaporate quickly in a weak market.


In the drilling group, **Noble** ([NE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NE)) continues to hold near highs after a heavy-volume breakout on July 7.

Trucking Stocks Fade
--------------------


Trucking stocks like **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)), **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)) and **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)) looked great early in the session, but gains faded badly.


The stock market might look vulnerable to the downside, but the short-term overbought/oversold oscillator (NASDQ in MarketSmith) is nearing lows not seen since mid-March, when indexes started to rally from oversold conditions.



Another feather in the bulls' cap besides an oversold Nasdaq? The Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers showed bullish sentiment falling off a cliff for the second straight week.


Two weeks ago, the percentage of bullish newsletter writers was up at 57.1%. That was just below the November 2021 reading of 57.2% before a big drop for the stock market. But bullish sentiment dropped to 52.2% last week and it fell to 47.1% this week. It's a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen at market tops in the past, just like excessive bearishness has been seen near market lows.


In economic news, July housing starts rose 3.9% in July, mostly in line with expectations, after a revised 11.7% drop in June. Homebuilders continue to be a pocket of strength in the stock market.


Several leaders in the group are holding above their 10-week moving averages after breakouts. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) continues to trade tightly above its 10-week line.


The 10-year Treasury yield rallied for the fifth straight session. Just after 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield was around 4.26%, up 4 basis points. Based on 3 p.m. ET quotes, the benchmark yield climbed to the highest level since June 2008, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

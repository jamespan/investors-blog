  Stock Market Adds To Gains As Earnings Impress, But Still Lacks This Ingredient

The main indexes climbed for a fourth straight day Wednesday, fortifying a stock market rebound that still is short on investing opportunities and narrow in breadth.




In a seesaw session, the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.9%. For both, it was the best four-day rally since November 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


In a positive sign, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% and closed above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) — the first major index to conquer that important level. Although uncertain in early trading, all three indexes strengthened and closed near session highs. That's a bullish trend that has characterized the market rebound.


Still, the four-day rally is moderating. After back-to-back vaults of more than 3%, the Nasdaq climbed less than 1% the next two days. Surely, no index can sustain outsized gains for long, but it's a reminder that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 could be ready to pause. The volatility since the new year suggests investors should be ready for more turbulence.

If institutional investors are buying into this new uptrend, it's not exactly a stampede. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have the lowest-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Ratings. There are about twice as many stocks with weak Acc/Dis Ratings than with bullish ratings.


Small caps lagged substantially Wednesday. The Russell 2000 slid 1%, with much of the weakness in consumer discretionary and health care small caps. Volume was nearly unchanged on the Nasdaq and appeared lower on the NYSE.


Stock Market Cheers Earnings Reports
------------------------------------


On Wednesday, the stock market put aside inflation fears and geopolitical tensions and applauded some significant earnings reports.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) jumped to a new high after the company late Tuesday [beat earnings and revenue expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-rises-as-earnings-beat-alphabet-announces-20-for-1-stock-split/). The parent of Google and YouTube also announced a 20-for-1 stock split scheduled to go into effect in July. Alphabet stock topped the 3,019.43 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) but closed below it.


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) also posted [a strong earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-scorches-fourth-quarter-targets/). The chipmaker sailed past analysts' estimates and gave bullish guidance for the current quarter and full year. AMD shares gapped up but reduced gains to 5.1%.


While AMD stock is barely recovering from a 40% debacle, its report helped cheer the semiconductor sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index jumped 2.5%.


In an initial look at the homebuilding industry's results, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) beat sales and profit expectations. The company raised its 2022 revenue forecast and said it sees a strong housing market. Shares were volatile and closed 1.6% higher.


The earnings momentum could be fading. After the close, **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) [easily beat December-quarter estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qualcomm-stock-chipmaker-beats-fiscal-first-quarter-targets/). But Qualcomm shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading. And **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also fell after the close after [results missed views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fb-stock-drops-meta-earnings-miss-estimates/).


Cyclical, Energy Opportunities In Stock Market
----------------------------------------------


With tech leaders still bloodied from the January correction, investors can find some buying opportunities in cyclical, energy and supply chain stocks.



So far this year, value stocks are outperforming growth. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) is nearly flat; iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) is down 9%.


Of the [33 IBD sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-01-2022/), only four are up for the year: Energy, Agriculture, Mining and the foggy Miscellaneous sector.


**UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) soared Tuesday on a strong earnings report and broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/). Ocean shipping stocks **Global Ship Lease** ([GSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSL)) and **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) also have broken out to new highs.


**PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)), an oil and gas exploration company, is holding above last week's [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). **Antero Resources** ([AR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AR)) and **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)) are peers that are near buy points.


The IBD 50 surged 3% Wednesday, its best day since Dec. 7. **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) led with a 7.8% jump. Blackstone, the subject of [IBD 50 Stocks to Watch Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/research/blackstone-stock-inches-toward-buypoint-after-strong-earnings/), broke out past the 136.56 buy point of a double-bottom base.

Stock Indexes Reverse Higher; Market Uptrend Resumes

Stocks reversed off a morning deficit and then pushed ahead for solid gains as the market outlook improved.

  

The Nasdaq drove to a record closing high, up 0.4% for the day. The S&P 500 added 0.2%. The IBD 50 popped 0.7%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

The action was enough to switch IBD's market outlook back to a confirmed uptrend.

  

Economic news was glum, making the day's gains respectable.

  

First-time jobless claims were 3% higher than expected. The Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index for April was also 3% worse than the Street's consensus. New-home sales for March were 7% off the mark.

  

The market may be playing its old game "bad news is good news." The idea is that weak data will prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.

  

Never mind that a rate hike is likely to be small. What the gamesmanship really points to is the weakness of the U.S. economic recovery.

  

If the U.S. recovery were typical of post-World War II recoveries — 4.5% GDP growth — then good news would steamroll the bears. But the bears have a case, and the market reflects that reality.

  

What would it take to shift this uptrend into overdrive?

  

A steep correction might drive out weak holders and leave the indexes in position to advance smartly. But with the uptrend resuming, this kind of correction looks unlikely for now.

  

Another possibility is a dynamic change in the economic landscape. For example, it wasn't too long ago that the next big things were supposed to be the cloud, 3D printing, shale and biotech.

  

Shale backfired at least for now. Biotech stocks have been leaders in the past 12 months and are still the No. 1 group, but many are starting to look old.

  

On Wednesday, a potential new factor emerged. China opened its heretofore protectionist door to credit card companies. If this move turns out to be big, then the market could create new leaders.

  

The problem with projected game changers is that they don't always pan out.

  

Meantime, breakouts Thursday included **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Harman International** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)).

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) rose 2% in heavy volume and then added 6% after hours. Quarterly results were roughly in line but surprised with a 7% same-store sales increase.

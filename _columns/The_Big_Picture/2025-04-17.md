The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled Thursday, while the other major stock indexes ended narrowly mixed, as Wall Street reacted to President Donald Trump's call to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.


Blue chips on the Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.3%, or 527 points. The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%. Also, the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.9%. The stock market will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.




Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but rose on the New York Stock Exchange compared with Wednesday's session. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.33%, still sharply off last week's highs.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors moved higher, with energy and consumer staples pacing the winners. The technology and health care sectors were the clear laggards of the session.


For the week, the Dow Jones industrials ended with a loss of 2.7%. The S&P 500 declined 1.5% on the week, while the Nasdaq moved down 2.6%.


Late Thursday, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) reported strong earnings results, sparking a 4% gain in extended trading. Further, the streaming giant closed just off a double-bottom buy point at 998.70 and was trading above that entry in after-hours trading.

Dow Jones Tumbles As Trump Calls For Powell's Exit
--------------------------------------------------


Early Thursday, Trump said Fed Chair Powell is always too late and wrong, and said his exit "cannot come fast enough." The remarks appeared to be a reaction to [Powell's Wednesday comments](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/market-suffers-another-black-eye-as-sellers-torch-magnificent-seven-chips-these-two-sectors-shine/) about big Trump tariffs spurring higher inflation and weaker growth, and his view that the Fed can still await more "clarity."


Powell's term ends in May 2026, with Trump's pick to head the Fed a huge decision. There also has been speculation that Trump could try to fire Powell, and even other Fed governors, given similar moves at other federal agencies.


Also Thursday, [Trump said](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114353201227355474) that he had a "very productive call" with the president of Mexico.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP041725.jpg)


The major stock indexes continue to hold above their early April lows, so the ongoing rally attempt remains intact. Investors are awaiting a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/), which would trigger the start of a new confirmed uptrend. That would also give investors the green light to begin buying some breakout stocks.


Remember, not all [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) succeed, but no market uptrend has started without one.


For now,Â IBD maintains a recommended exposure level at 0%-20% for investors. That's a clear sign that caution continues to be the obvious choice, a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).

Market Leaders To Watch: ADMA, MercadoLibre
-------------------------------------------


Amid the ongoing stock market correction, market leaders to watch include **ADMA Biologics** ([ADMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADMA)) and **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)).



[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) ADMA Biologics is in a 5% buy range above a 20.70 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSurge chart analysis](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). The relative strength line, which measures the stock's performance against the rest of the market, reached a new high this week.


E-commerce leader MercadoLibre is forming a double-bottom base that has a 2,202 buy point, as shares regained their 50-day line this week. Its RS line also is at new highs, triggering the blue dot on the IBD MarketSurge chart. That's a bullish indicator of market leadership.

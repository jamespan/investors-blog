Market volatility was in full effect Tuesday as the major averages opened higher, reversed lower and then rallied strongly into the close.


The Nasdaq erased a 1.7% intraday gain but found its footing late. It ended an eight-session slide, rising 1%. The S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.7%. Volume on the NYSE rose slightly from Monday's level. Nasdaq volume fell.


Small caps didn't participate much as the Russell 2000 gained just 0.3%. The IBD 50 performed in line with the broad market, rising 0.9%.

Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the IBD 50. Headed into Tuesday, the index of leading growth stocks fell 9.5% in the prior eight sessions.


Despite Tuesday's gains, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are still early in their rally attempts. In other words, it's too early to say that the selling has run its course. After eight straight declines for the Nasdaq, a bounce of some sort was expected.


What's key is what the market does from here. Will institutional investors start to wade back into the market? Or is more selling around the corner? As always, watch for price and volume clues in the major averages.


The market was held hostage by oil for the better part of Tuesday's session but broke free, even as oil logged another sharp decline.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil for February delivery dipped below $30 a barrel but eventually settled at $30.44 a barrel, down 97 cents, or 3.1%. It's a perfect storm for lower oil prices amid a strong U.S. dollar, a supply glut and slowing growth in China.


The Nasdaq was helped early by strength in **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). All three benefited from positive comments by Credit Suisse.


But a look at the Leaders Up In Volume section of today's Market Pulse isn't exactly a who's who of institutional-quality names. Some of the market's strongest stock these days are less-liquid names.


Restaurant chain **Chuy's** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)) has solid fundamentals and a bullish chart, but it's on the speculative side, with an average daily dollar of volume of around $10 million. Still, it climbed to a new high. Shares rose 5.5% in heavy volume.


Small-cap **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) is more compelling, with an average daily dollar volume just over $38 million.


Shares gapped up Tuesday, rising 5% in solid volume. It's getting support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after a November breakout. It's also back above a 106.53 flat-base entry that it initially cleared on Dec. 15.


Turning to the retail space, **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) fits the definition of an institutional-quality name. It gapped up, rising 3.5% in heavy volume.


It closed just below a 55.74 cup-with-handle buy point. Keep in mind that technical breakouts have the best chance of working during confirmed market uptrends â€” when fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines.


That's not happening now, which is why breakouts, and growth stocks in general, are having a hard time making headway.

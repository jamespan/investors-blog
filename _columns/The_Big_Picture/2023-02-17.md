The stock market ended a tough week mixed as growling bears snapped at defensive bulls. But it was a net positive that indexes closed well off the intraday lows.




The Nasdaq lagged other major indexes on Friday, sliding 0.6% and ending the week in the lower half of its trading range. Despite this, it closed higher for the sixth time in the last seven weeks, booking a weekly gain of 0.6%.


The tech-heavy index remains clear of its major moving averages and held support at the 21-day line. [A power trend remains in force](https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-enters-rare-power-trend-here-are-3-ways-to-profit/?src=A00220), with the 21-day exponential moving average still well clear of the 50-day line.


The S&P 500 closed at session highs but still fell 0.2%. It also fell for the second week in a row. The benchmark index undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) but did manage to end the session just above it.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best on the stock market Friday, rising 0.3%. It is continuing to hold above its 10-week moving average despite booking modest losses for three weeks in a row. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) led the upside while **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) fared worst. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) cooled again, ending the week 1.9% lower.


Small caps dug in, helping the Russell 2000 end 0.3% higher. This key market group popped 1.5% for the week. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied into the close but still lost 0.9%.


The overall picture remains bullish for now, which justifies building 60% to 80% exposure. But remember to stay on top of sell signals within your portfolio. Any stock that falls 7% to 8% from your purchase price should be axed. Also beware of sharp breaks below the 50-day or 10-week moving averages.

Retail Earnings, Fed Minutes Loom
---------------------------------


A couple of important developments are on the horizon in the coming week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MP_3x2_021723-1-274x300.jpg)


Firstly, a slate of retail earnings will give investors a deeper insight into the current health of the consumer. This is important, given consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. GDP.


Dow Jones retail giants **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) are among the key names set to report.


Recent monthly data showed U.S. retail sales rose by the most in nearly two years in January, but earnings will give more detailed insight for investors.


The SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)), a Leaderboard member, is up nearly 18% so far in 2023.


Meanwhile, the latest Fed minutes are set for Wednesday release. These could give crucial clues on central bankers' thoughts on fiscal policy going forward.


These Stock Market Groups Shine
-------------------------------


The stock market action was reflected in the performance of the S&P 500 sectors, which ended mixed on Friday. The defensive consumer staples and utilities groups led the upside while technology and energy lagged.


Investors were able to glean a more granular view from the relative performance of the IBD industry groups.


This time it was media periodicals, wireless telecom services firms, farm machinery stocks and diversified firms turning in the best sessions.


In contrast, electronic consumer product plays, wood product stocks, and a variety of oil and gas groups struggled.

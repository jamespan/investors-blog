When will it happen? The biggest question in investors' minds — aside from the future of Greece and the euro — did not get resolved on Wednesday. But judging from the modest rally by the key indexes, the market appears ready for the first hike in U.S. short-term interest rates to occur sometime this year.

  

It was a lightly seesawing session, but both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 ended up mildly in the black, up 0.2%. Volume rose across the board.

  

A statement issued at 2 p.m. ET by the Federal Reserve following a two-day meeting sparked some buying late in the session. Perhaps there was relief that the U.S. central bank did not make a move to raise the cost of money.

  

The last hike in interest rates came in June 2006; under the helm of former Fed chief Alan Greenspan, the Fed pushed the federal funds rate up 25 basis points to 5.25%. It was the 17th in a series of rate hikes that lasted over a two-year span. Today, the rate that banks pay for overnight loans still hovers near 0%.

  

In its statement, the Fed acknowledged moderate expansion in the economy and "some improvement" in the housing sector. However, it also moaned that "business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft."

  

There are four more Fed meetings left in the year. According to futures market data, participants still see a relatively low chance of the first increase in rates at the Sept. 16 meeting.

  

As another sign of just how sensitive the market is to interest rates, consider that on Wednesday the lowly Dow utilities posted the biggest advance, up 1%. That sector index is still down 8.3% since Jan. 1. The Nasdaq is up 6.9% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 is up just 2%.

  

On Page B2, keep an eye on the NYSE advance-decline line, one of the simplest measures of market breadth. (It's plotted below the price bars of the S&P 500 chart.) That line has been in a mild downtrend for nearly eight weeks. That's no surprise, given that the broad market itself has been flatlining for months. If the index were to move higher while the A-D line fell, that would mark a negative divergence.

  

The Nasdaq's A-D line, not shown on B2, has moved sideways for more than four weeks.

  

The IBD 50 rose 0.6%. Among high-quality stocks, bases continue to develop. Growth stocks are still breaking out to new highs.

  

Sell rules need to be reviewed and implemented, though. Thinly traded **Methode Electronics** ([MEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEI)) (89 Composite, 96 EPS) sharply undercut its 50-day line Tuesday in the heaviest trade since a March 5 breakout. A weak rebound in lighter trade would confirm that it's time to take profits.

Stock Market Grinds Higher But Will Powell Spoil The Party? Tesla Stock Helps This Group
=========================================================================================

The stock market managed to end the week on a positive note, though indexes closed well off highs for the day. The next move from the Federal Reserve now looms large.




The Nasdaq composite turned in a slender 0.2% gain, with its weekly lift an even weaker 0.1%. Nevertheless, the tech-heavy index is up in each of the past seven weeks, its strongest run since November 2019. With a substantial gain of almost 28% so far this year, not to mention a comfortable cushion above the 21-day line, a pause could be constructive.


The S&P 500 managed to clamber 0.1% higher and remains above its short-term moving averages. While its weekly gain of 0.4% was slim, it has now risen for four weeks in a row. The last time it achieved such a streak was August last year. It has now risen more than 12% in 2023.


But the fact that decliners outnumbered advancers by almost 2-to-1 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq could be a sign of some underlying weakness, though volume was mixed. The way indexes faded from early gains also indicated selling into strength.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average actually fought its way out of negative territory to end the day up 0.1%. [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) led the index while **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) lagged.


Notably, small caps failed to keep pace, with the Russell 2000 skidding 0.8%. Growth stocks reversed lower for the day, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slipping 0.1%.


Powell Speech After Fed Meeting Could Be Key
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MP0609232-2-189x300.jpg)The latest meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is due to take place Tuesday and Wednesday. An interest rate pause is broadly expected, with the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) putting the odds of a hike at less than 30%.


Fed Chair Jerome Powell previously said the central bank was "getting close" to the end of its rate raising phase. His post-meeting comments on the pathway forward from here could send the market shooting higher or lower.


On Tuesday morning, the [consumer price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) comes out.


Earnings season has largely passed, though there are some notable reports next week. Highflying tech stock **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) reports late Monday while software play **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is due after the close Thursday.


Tesla Helps This Stock Market Group
-----------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the session mixed. Technology and consumer discretionary led the upside while energy and materials lagged.



The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a more granular view of the stock market action.


Desktop software plays, accident and health insurers, and movie stocks all shined. But it was automakers that were the best-performing group, helped by strong performance of **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). [The Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) ended the session up 4.1%.


On the flip side, dairy products, cable plays, trucking transportation stocks and TV companies all suffered.

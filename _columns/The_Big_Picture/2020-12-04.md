Stock Market Indexes Hit New Highs; Will These 13 Lucky Stocks Keep Rising In December?

Talk about a stock market that can climb a wall of worry.




Coronavirus is raging again across America. The November jobs report, showing a 245,000-job net boost in nonfarm payrolls, missed economists' views by a country mile. Supply chain snafus announced by **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) hint that it will take months for the U.S. to get deployment of a new Covid-19 vaccine up to warp speed.


Yet Wall Street always looks to the future. And new highs by a gaggle of major indexes reflect a confidence that the country, and the rest of the world, will in fact get to the end of this dark tunnel.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% on Friday, comparable to gains of 0.9% by the S&P 500 and 0.8% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Oil, steel, metals, electronics, computer, transportation and other cyclical types of stocks beamed with gains in the 3%-or-more category. Small caps really shined. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF blasted its way to another new high, rising 2.3%.


![MP120420](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP120420-267x300.jpg)At 188.23, the ETF now shows an almost unheard-of 25.6% gain for the fourth quarter. And four weeks of trading remain in 2020.


Strength in commodities helps to broaden the current advance since the Dow industrials' Nov. 4 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). U.S. crude oil futures jumped another 0.9% to $46.04 a barrel. United States Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), up 1%, reached its highest level since April 20.


Friday's headlines suggested both sides of Congress will eventually pass a new deal to help the economy. Failure in that end could spur some heavy institutional selling. Yet for now, as the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count of the Market Pulse shows, the amount of professional selling remains reasonable. That's good for the bulls.


What's not so good?Â The latest [bulls vs. bears survey from Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) remains a serious short-term concern. While bullishness has climbed to a year-to-date peak of 64.7%, the bears ratio has dipped to 16.7%.


Look closely at a graph of the bearish ratio, and you'll see that it can stay low for months before the market actually breaks down. The fourth quarter of 2018 and the Q4 in 2019 offer recent examples.


13 Lucky Stocks In The Stock Market Today?
------------------------------------------


A better indicator of what stocks are doing? Assemble a group of stocks that are leading the market. If they are continuing to rise nicely, moving out of good bases and hitting new highs, then consider yourself in the midst of a strong bull market.


But when these top stocks fall en masse and volume soars, you have an immediate signal that a character shift may be underway.


[On IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)), **Exact Sciences** ([EXAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXAS)), **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) have gotten some airplay. One could certainly see these seven growth stocks as current market leaders representing a wide band of sectors.


Meanwhile, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) all hail from [IBD's Long-Term Leaders list](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). These 13 stocks offer a good sense of how the market leadership is behaving.

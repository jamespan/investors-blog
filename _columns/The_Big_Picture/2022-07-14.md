The stock market slashed into heavy losses and finished mixed after being hit by another hot inflation report — the Labor Department's producer price index. Next up, earnings season continues Friday with reports due out from **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), Dow Jones stock **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Wells** **Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)).




On the economic front, the Labor Department's Producer Price Index showed a 1.1% increase in June, higher than estimates for a 0.8% rise. Producer inflation jumped 11.3% year-over-year, much hotter than the 10.4% estimate and higher than May's 10.8% increase. The producer price index is a measure of pricing strength based on selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.


The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.96%, snapping a three-day losing streak. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices erased big losses Thursday. After briefly trading below $91 a barrel and hitting its lowest level since late February, West Texas Intermediate closed above $96 a barrel.


On the earnings front, banking giants **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), along with **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), reported their [quarterly earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/jpm-stock-morgan-stanley-dive-after-missing-q2-views/). Dow Jones stock JPMorgan tumbled 3.5%, while Morgan Stanley pared losses to 0.4%. [TSMC rose almost 3%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-tops-q2-targets-guides-higher/) Thursday.

Inflation Remains Hot
---------------------


Two hotter-than-expected inflation reports this week — Wednesday's consumer price index and Thursday's PPI — make it clear that the Federal Reserve will continue to aggressively raise interest rates to combat surging inflation. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech he is open to a "larger hike" at the July meeting this month than in June. For now, the probability of a 100 basis-point increase stands around 44%, according to CME Group data.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP071422-237x300.jpg)But the Fed is hiking rates at the risk of sparking a recession. While [most Americans think the U.S. economy is already in a recession](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/most-americans-think-the-u-s-economy-is-in-a-recession-ibd-tipp/), Wall Street's banks are starting to come around to that idea as well. On Wednesday, Bank of America's economists forecast a "mild recession this year." The bank's economists expect fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product to decline 1.4% from a year earlier, followed by a 1% increase in 2023.


[Per Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-13/bank-of-america-economists-forecast-mild-us-recession-this-year), Bank of America joins Wells Fargo and Nomura in expecting a recession in 2022. Deutsche Bank, one of the first major banks to forecast such a contraction, sees one starting in 2023.


Stock Market Trend
------------------


The struggling stock market uptrend ran into more problems Thursday, as the stock market briefly sold off sharply and indexes slid about 2%. But for a second straight day, the market ended well off early morning lows. The Nasdaq snapped a three-day losing streak, while the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 extended losing streaks to five sessions.


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The Nasdaq inched higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.1%. Volume inched higher on the Nasdaq and also rose on the NYSE.  Thus, the S&P 500 picked up another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), taking its count to four.


Top growth stocks ended higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose nearly 0.5%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) rallied 1.7%, reclaiming a 166.45 cup-with-handle entry.

Stocks To Watch: BJ's, Murphy USA, O'Reilly
-------------------------------------------


Amid a stock market rally that is trying to stem its slide, some stocks are holding up the best, including **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)), **Murphy USA** ([MUSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MUSA)) and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)). These three stocks boast relative strength lines at new highs, which indicates big stock market outperformance.


[IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) BJ's Wholesale is at the top of the [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) above a 67 buy point from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) after Thursday's 2.9% rise. Meanwhile, a large double bottom that spans back to November 2021 shows a 71.10 buy point, which can be used as an additional entry.


Murphy USA is holding above a 262.68 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) following Monday's [breakout move](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) goes up to 275.81. Murphy has now posted two quarters of accelerating earnings growth. During that time, EPS gains have jumped from 75% to 202%, which helps [Murphy USA stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-murphy-usa-inc-musa.aspx) boast a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


Auto parts leaders O'Reilly Automotive is building a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 748.78 buy point. Keep an eye out for a potential handle to form.


Remember, the stock market volatility is a reason to remain conservative. But these three leaders are stocks to watch.

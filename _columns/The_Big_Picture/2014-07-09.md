Major averages rallied in lighter volume Wednesday after the minutes from the June 15 Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed a little more clarity about the Fed's course of action.


The Nasdaq rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 added 0.5%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 up just 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Tuesday's levels. Breadth was mediocre at best, with advancing stocks topping decliners by a 3-2 margin on both exchanges. The IBD 50 outperformed, rising just over 1%.


The minutes from the June FOMC meeting showed the Fed aims to end its bond-buying program in October, assuming the economic recovery stays on track. The market expected this, but it was the first time the Fed came out and specifically said it.


No word yet on when the Fed will start to raise interest rates, but it has said rates will remain near zero for a "considerable time" after the monthly asset purchases stop. The market expects the Fed to start raising rates around mid-2015.


Meanwhile, the latest survey of newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence showed a rise in bullish sentiment to 60.6% from 57.6% last week. The bulls-bears spread of 45.4 percentage points is the highest since early January. Excessive bullishness can act as a contrarian market-topping signal.


The increase in bullish sentiment is noteworthy. That said, most leading growth stocks haven't rolled over. Some have traveled back to buy points but aren't showing meaningful signs of institutional selling. Some recent breakouts have been sluggish but technical damage has been limited. It doesn't make sense to be fully invested at this point, especially with distribution building up in the market. But some exposure is OK.


Among the day's gainers, a breakout for **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) finally came to fruition. Shares rose 2% but volume was modestly above average.


Meanwhile, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) continue to work on cup-with-handle bases. Chipotle jumped 3% in decent volume after Wunderlich Securities said there's been "little if any push-back" after the burrito chain raised prices.


Under Armour added 3% is soft volume. It closed just below a buy point of 60.23.


Oil lost ground for the ninth straight session, falling just over 1% to $102.29 a barrel, amid a smaller-than-expected decline in weekly crude supplies as well as signs of increased production from Libya.


Airline stocks have been thriving amid weakness in oil. IBD's Transportation-Airline group was one of the day's top performers, rising nearly 2%.

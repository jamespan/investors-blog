Oil was volatile Monday, but that wasn’t the case for the stock market, as stocks reversed higher and held gains after a soft start.


The S&P 500 led the way, up 0.7%. It marked its highest close since Dec. 1 and is only 1% off its 52-week high. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6%, helped by strength in **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)). The Nasdaq added 0.4%.


![MP041816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP041816-1-177x300.jpg)Volume on the Nasdaq rose from Friday’s levels. NYSE volume fell. Volume Friday was below average but skewed somewhat by options expiration.


Once again, growth stocks showed signs of life with the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) up 1.1%. **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) did the heavy lifting in the IBD 50, up nearly 8% in more than double-average volume. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE; the ratio was nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The stock market followed oil lower early but quickly found its footing after oil pared losses. The oil market was spooked early after large oil producers over the weekend failed to reach an agreement on an output freeze. WTI crude oil shed more than 4% just after the open but pared its loss to 1.4% by the close, ending at $39.78 a barrel, helped by news of an oil workers’ strike in Kuwait.


Amid a lot of pessimism about Q1 earnings season, there’s more to like about underlying market health than not to like. A quick scan through several growth-stock screens shows no shortage of stocks in bullish setups, and many more trading tightly and holding gains post-breakout. Many stocks, though, have made modest progress from buy points.


When it comes to market technicals, the overall picture looks pretty good. The Nasdaq shows four recent days of bullish price action: March 29, April 1, April 12 and April 13. The first three were upside reversals in higher volume. The last one was a gap up that resulted in the resumption of the market uptrend.


Meanwhile, a weekly chart for the S&P 500 shows two recent accumulation weeks: the week ended March 4, and the week ended March 18. Accumulation weeks are good to see when a stock or an index gets into position for a breakout try.


Among the day’s movers, it’s been a low-volume breakout so far for **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), but buyers were in the stock again Monday on news the company is taking on **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) head-on, offering its Amazon Prime Video service for $8.99 a month. Shares rose 1.5%.

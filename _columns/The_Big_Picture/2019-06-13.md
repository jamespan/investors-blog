title: Stocks Pop, But Investors Have Cause To Pause

The current stock market has no shortage of items that give investors reason to pause. Yet a handful of leaders are showing strong action early in the new uptrend.




On Thursday, the indexes ended a two-session losing streak — make that three days if Monday's negative reversal is included.


The Nasdaq popped 0.6% Thursday and closed fairly high in the day's range, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% each.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed an increase in NYSE volume from the previous session.


Cause To Pause
--------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP061319-300x288.jpg)Reasons for pause in the current stock market include unresolved battles at the major indexes' 50-day lines, unresolved trade disputes with China, and the two-day Federal Reserve meeting set for June 18-19.


The Fed isn't expected to cut interest rates until July, but that view has its dissenters — adding one more thing that hasn't been resolved.


"Unresolved" isn't a word normally associated with market uptrends. But it could be investors are learning to live with uncertainty.


Small Ball
----------


President Donald Trump's tariff wars began Jan. 23, 2018. If the market's performance has since been lackluster, well, at least bulls can say things haven't fallen apart. (The Nasdaq has gained 5% and the S&P 500 2% during the tariff wars.)


Perhaps the key to success in this market is to play small ball. If 5% is the best the Nasdaq can do in the past year and a half or so, then longer-term caution and shorter-term savvy might be the formula for consistent success. In other words, investors may try for smaller profits than usual.


Current Stock Market: The Lineup
--------------------------------


The lineup of winners over the past four sessions includes some stocks with hard-luck stories to tell.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) bounced off its 50-day line June 4, setting a secondary buy zone. However, the market [was in correction until June 7](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/). The uptrend's confirmation came when Starbucks was extended. So the only winners in that hard-luck story are investors who already held shares.


Upscale home furnishings provider **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) scored a 16% gain Thursday on quarterly results. But the happy ending didn't last. The stock isn't anywhere near a valid buy point. Also, the stock encountered fierce resistance at the 200-day moving average.


Initial public offering **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) has added 2% so far this week. Yet the El Segundo, Calif.-based company has lost money in each of the past three years. More losses are expected this year. Its sales growth has been impressive, a trait some of the top-performing IPOs share.


**Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) is up about 3% this week but is nearly extended from a third-stage base. Stocks with that old of a story carry added risk.


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) rushed ahead almost 7% so far this week. The IPO's consolidation offered a 91.56 buy point. More realistically, a gap-up placed the entry at the June 7 opening price of 93.66. Zoom is now too extended to buy. Annual earnings have been meager, ranging from a loss of a penny to a gain of 3 cents a share.


On a more profitable note, online handmade goods retailer **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) is trading in a [stage-two base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). The stock is about 4% off its high. Etsy has grown earnings more than 100% in each of the past two quarters. Revenue has increased 40% or more in the same quarters.


Better Stories To Tell
----------------------


Three additional stocks that might have better stories to tell include **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)), a manufacturer of standby power generators; retailer **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)); and payment processor **Pay Pal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)).


In a May podcast, William O'Neil protege David Ryan mentioned those three stocks as items to watch. The [podcast is still available](https://www.investors.com/research/top-stocks-to-buy-oneil-protege-paypal-stock-ollies-stock/) at Investors.com.

The stock market ended with strong gains Wednesday despite no shortage of election uncertainty. The gains came not so much because the stock market is anticipating a Trump victory. Instead, it's looking at a divided Congress that would likely mean less regulatory scrutiny for large-cap technology stocks.




On the heels of a strong earnings report last week, Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) gapped up to an all-time high and broke out of a cup base. Fellow FANG stock **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) also gapped up and broke out over a [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/).


Several top-rated growth stocks outperformed, and the bullish session amounted to [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.


The Dow Jones closed off highs after trying to move above its 50-day moving average. It rose 1.3%. With a close in the bottom half of Wednesday's price range, it wasn't a powerful follow-through day by any means, but it still qualified. The S&P 500's 2.2% gain looked better, but the index also closed off highs. The Nasdaq composite closed near its high, but Wednesday was only the third day of a rally attempt. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was higher than Tuesday.


Stock Market In A Confirmed Uptrend
-----------------------------------


The Dow and S&P 500 followed through and confirmed a new uptrend on the fourth day of their rally attempts. The first day of the rally attempt was Friday. The Dow fell 0.6% on that day, but it closed near its session high, a sign of at least some institutional demand.

Buying demand on that day wasn't as evident in the S&P 500. Still, the index closed barely in the upper half of its range, qualifying as the first day of a rally attempt. The Nasdaq didn't qualify due to a close near session lows.


After a strong move above its 50-day moving average Tuesday, the small-cap Russell 2000 watched Wednesday's stock market rally from the sidelines. The index could only a manage a gain of less than 0.1%, weighed down by weakness in financial stocks. The third highest-weighted sector in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is financial services. Financial stocks followed the 10-year Treasury yield lower, which plunged 13 basis points to 0.77%.


Keep in mind that follow-through days don't always result in explosive rallies. The S&P 500's follow-through on April 2 and the Nasdaq's follow-through on April 6 spawned a big stock market rally. But the Dow's follow-through day on Sept. 30 only amounted to a short tradable rally.


What wouldn't be good to see is a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or higher-volume decline in the S&P 500 in the first few days after the follow-through. A close below the low of the follow-through day in coming days wouldn't be a good sign, either.


Health Care Sector Leads
------------------------


Managed care firms outperformed as it looked likely Republicans would maintain control of the Senate. This makes the possibility of significant health care reform less likely.


Dow Jones stock **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) soared to an all-time high. The health insurer is the second highest-weighted stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)), which jumped 4.4%. Of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, health care was the top performer.


**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) also outperformed in the Dow. It's enjoying a solid test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in August.


Three China Breakouts
---------------------


With the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend, be on the lookout for new buys. The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) delivered plenty of actionable stocks Wednesday, including **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)). It gapped out of a cup with handle base with an 85.49 buy point, rising 8% to 89.31. Fellow China stock **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) gapped out of a consolidation, rising nearly 13%.

Chinese electric vehicle maker **Xpeng** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) broke out with conviction from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), soaring 23% to 27.39. It's well past the 5% buy zone from the 23.20 entry.


Other MarketSmith Growth 250 breakouts included **Grocery Outlet** ([GO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GO)), which reports earnings next week. **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)), **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)), **GDS Holdings** ([GDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDS)), **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) and **ResMed** ([RMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMD)) also topped buy points.



Start slowly with new purchases and see how they do. If you've been raising cash, don't go back to fully invested all at once. Try some new buys. If they work, you can add to them.


IBD's enterprise software group was one of the day's top performers, rising nearly 6%. **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) soared to a new high ahead of Thursday's earnings report.


Bullish Stock Market Sentiment Drops
------------------------------------


Stock market bulls also got good news for the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers. The bulls dropped to 53.6% in the latest week from a lofty level of 60.6% the prior week. The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. When sentiment is overly bullish, it's time to be bearish — and vice versa.

Stock Indexes Take Hard Hits; Market Uptrend Under Pressure
============================================================

Stocks ratcheted lower Friday in fast trade, with the indexes suffering their biggest percentage losses since late January.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 skidded 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively. The IBD 50 lost 1.5%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The action slapped both indexes with a distribution day, the footprint of institutional selling, and shifted IBD's market outlook to uptrend under pressure.


With the caution light on, individual investors might want to raise some cash where appropriate.


Bulls were left with only a few profitable niches Friday. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, only seven rose. Super-regional banks comprised the top group.


Market watchers spent a lot of time explaining why the market went down.


One camp said that the payroll and unemployment data were unexpectedly strong, so the market retreated on conviction that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in June, or at least September.


Others said that the payroll and unemployment data were weaker than the numbers suggest — with a lower participation rate accounting for the fall in the jobless rate and the payroll number lagging the Q4 hiring pace. By that logic, the market retreated on signs that the U.S. economy is weaker than expected.


To complicate things further, some economists have argued that the financial system would work better with higher interest rates — i.e., near-zero rates make it hard for banks to make money.


Individual investors should let others wallow in arguments. Stay focused on the price-and-volume action of stocks and the indexes. They will give you actionable information.


The important reality is this: Institutions are clearly lightening up. Distribution on one or both indexes occurred in four of the past six sessions, and the two up sessions came in lighter volume.


If institutional selling continues, a pullback of some sort is unavoidable.


The Nasdaq rallied from Feb. 2 to March 2. The 9.3% gain is in line with the rallies of 2014, which averaged 10.1%.


Sometimes sideways action followed the gains last year, but the 2014 pullbacks ranged from about 4% to 11%.


Nothing says that history has to repeat, but it's good to be aware of recent trends.


On Friday, a few top stocks broke out.


**Cooper** ([COO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COO)) gapped up 9% in heavy volume, clearing a fourth-stage base. The contact-lens maker reported mixed quarterly results late Thursday. Earnings beat the Street's estimates, but revenue missed.


**Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) gapped up 4% in heavy volume. The footwear and apparel retailer topped analysts' numbers on the top and bottom line.


Other breakouts are struggling.


**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) broke out with a 12% gap-up on Feb. 26. Volume was heavy. The stock promptly went into reverse, dropping in five of the next six sessions, mostly in strong volume. By Friday's close, the stock was back below the ideal buy point.


For the week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 1.6% and 0.7% respectively. The IBD 50 tacked on 0.3%.


Several indexes are either under or near the 50-day line now.


The NYSE edged under its 50-day, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 are barely above the line. The Nasdaq has a bit of air as it sits 3% above its 50-day line.

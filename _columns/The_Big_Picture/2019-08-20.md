  Stock Market Today Shows Broad Drop But Also These 2 Silver Linings

The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) showed typical behavior during a broad sell-off. That is, you tend to see equal amounts of profit-taking across a wide spectrum of industries. Yet Tuesday's decline also seemed to mask two silver linings.




The first silver lining? Leading growth stocks didn't fall on their faces. [Some names in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) in fact shined. All four active plays in [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) rose on average 2% for the day.


The second silver lining? Despite a flurry of selling in the final 10 minutes of the trading day, the major indexes actually gave up a relatively minor amount of their outsize gains in the prior two sessions.


In a classic repetition of the "two steps forward, one step back" routine, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all dropped 0.6% to 0.8%. This followed a roughly 3% gain over the prior two days by the Nasdaq, and a nearly 2.9% advance for the S&P over the prior three trading days.

CLOSE




Volume sank hard vs. Monday, down nearly 10% on the Nasdaq and about 5% lower on the NYSE.


A relatively mild drop in lighter turnover is perfectly acceptable amid a confirmed market uptrend. And gee, you might even call it a victory when the uptrend is under pressure (as it is today, as the Market Pulse shows below). Of course, the summer doldrums are here. Trading truly lightens up during the final two weeks of August as traffic appears to be heating up at the nation's airports.


The S&P 500's 0.8% drop underscored profit-taking across big bunches of industries. At least [two dozen IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-20-2019/) fell 1.5% or more. They ranged from data storage to managed care, from computer networking to superregional banks.


Down, But Not Severely So
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP_082019-255x300.jpg)Yet if you look at the prior nine down sessions of this large-cap index, you'll find that Tuesday's decline turns out to be one of the milder ones. It follows a negative 0.9% reversal on Aug. 1, a 3% waterfall-like decline on Aug. 5, a 1.2% drubbing on Aug. 12, and a 2.9% flop in higher volume on Aug. 14.


That Aug. 14 sell-off, for now, serves as the sole [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) since IBD upgraded the market outlook to "confirmed uptrend" on Aug. 13 — thanks to a [Day 6 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) by the Nasdsaq composite.


The average drop among the seven down sessions in August for the S&P 500, including Tuesday? Almost 1.5%.


Despite that fairly hefty size of average declines, the S&P 500 lies just 4% below its all-time peak near 3028.


So, all things considered, given continued investor angst over the future of U.S.-China economic cooperation, how U.K. Prime Minister Boris "BoJo" Johnson will handle his nation's divorce from the EU, and stagnation of economic activity in Germany and Japan, one has to think that large caps on this side of the pond are acting pretty well.


The cover of the latest issue of The Economist, titled "Markets in an Age of Anxiety," neatly illustrates this lingering pessimism.


Hurdles For The Stock Market Today
----------------------------------


Technical challenges, of course, remain for the U.S. stock market.


In a healthy uptrend, the major indexes handily retake their 50-day moving averages and lead them higher. That has yet to happen for [the S&P 500](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-s-and-p-500-index-0sandp5.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily), the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In fact, the Nasdaq is meeting some resistance at the 50-day line this week.



After the market slid into its first correction of 2019 during May, the S&P 500 dropped sharply below its 50-day moving average. It spent four weeks underneath the red line drawn in IBD daily charts and in [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks) until a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/) signal flashed on June 7.


Tuesday marked the 12th session in which the S&P mostly dwelled beneath its 50-day line.


Heading into Tuesday's action, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating for both the S&P 500 and the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite held the unsavory rating of D+. A C grade is neutral. Any lower than C means the market is hinting at net institutional selling over the past 13 weeks.

True Market Leaders Today
-------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) inched fractionally lower.


At 34.06, FFTY remains down nearly 0.7% for the third quarter, but up 23.3% for the year.



**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), a [Sector Leaders stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) member and part of [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), cruised to its fourth straight gain with a 1.4% advance. The innovator in human capital management closed just above a 245.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [late-stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). Volume fell 17% below average.


Longtime IBD readers know that a breakout usually stands a much better chance of winning when volume is robust, rising 40% above average. Small cap or midcap? You might even see a 200% or 300% increase in turnover vs. its 50-day average. However, volume can be light due to seasonal factors or as fund managers await important news.


Of course, exceptions to [the rule on breakout volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-apple-nvidia-breakouts-still-worked-despite-light-volume/) do and will occur.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) in Paycom made a new high.


**Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) and [IBD 50 small-cap](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) **Paysign** ([PAYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYS)) continue to act like true leaders of 2019.

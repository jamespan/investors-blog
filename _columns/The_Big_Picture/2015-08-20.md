Stock Indexes Careen Lower; Increased Volume Cranks Up Pain
============================================================

Stocks rushed south Thursday, pulling down 19 of every 20 industry groups. The Nasdaq suffered a 2.8% dent, while the S&P 500 crumpled 2.1%. The IBD 50 fell 3.1%. Volume rose across the board.

  

The Nasdaq closed at its low for the day, leaving it 6.8% off its July high and marking its sharpest pullback of the year. The S&P 500 also closed at the day's low and is now 4.6% off its May high.

  

Most top-rated stocks did not suffer losses in strong volume. Still, the day's action cranked up the pressure on the uptrend.

  

The put-call ratio closed at 1.21. The secondary indicator has been fairly useful in identifying market lows. Thursday's reading suggests a low is near.

  

The best strategy now is to remain disciplined â€” sell those stocks that trigger the 8% sell rule or that are in a profit-taking zone. Normally, the profit-taking zone is 20% to 25%. Studies show that stocks tend to consolidate after such a gain.

  

However, some investors may have set tighter exits, and there is nothing wrong with taking smaller profits and cutting losses more quickly.

  

Many homebuilder stocks have broken out recently. On Thursday, most fell less than the indexes and mostly in lower volume.

  

The chart should be an investor's guide to selling, and few homebuilders are flashing sell signals.

  

For example, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) is 11% past a 28.80 buy point. Since breaking out July 30, three up weeks each have been in above-average volume. The sole down week was in below-average volume. The relative price strength line is at a high, which means it's outperforming the S&P 500.

  

A chart like that is saying hold.

  

The homebuilder industry group has gained almost 13% so far in Q3.

  

For an update on the housing sector landscape, individual investors might want to read or re-read Wednesday's Page 1 story [on homebuilders](http://news.investors.com/economy/081815-767108-homebuilders-lead-housing-recovery-as-demand-outpaces-supply.htm).

  

Another step is to go beyond the homebuilder group and study related groups, such as air conditioning/heating, cement, construction products, real estate developers and retail-wholesale building products.

  

Economic news was mixed Thursday. First-time jobless claims and leading indicators for July were worse than expected. Existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed's business outlook were stronger than the Street's estimates.

  

Friday is an options expiration day, which often boosts volume.

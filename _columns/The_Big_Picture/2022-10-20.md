The stock market reversed from sharp gains to end with moderate losses Thursday. The major stock indexes, and prudent investors, still await the bullish signal that confirms the start of a new stock market uptrend.




Amid a stock market that is holding above its recent 2022 lows, [recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/doubleverify-stock-plots-strong-relative-strength-line-amid-netflix-deal/) and [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **DoubleVerify** ([DV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DV)) is a potential stock market leader to watch, as it trades just shy of its latest buy point.


Economic Data, Treasury Yields
------------------------------


First-time jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to 214,000 vs. 228,000 in the previous week. Econoday estimates were for initial claims to rise to 235,000.


The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing index came in at -8.7, lower than the expected -5.0 reading. A negative measurement indicates contraction in factory-sector growth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MP102022-268x300.jpg)Lastly, [U.S. existing home sales declined for an eighth straight month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-sales-dropped-for-eighth-straight-month-in-september-11666274881) in September as rising mortgage rates made home purchases less affordable. Home sales fell 1.5% in September vs. the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.71 million, the weakest rate since May 2020. September sales fell 23.8% from a year earlier.


Midday Thursday, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said that higher interest rates have done little to lower inflation, so more increases will be needed.


The Fed's benchmark interest rate is currently in a range of 3%-3.25%. Harker believes that rates will soon go higher, saying "We are going to keep raising rates for awhile. Given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4% by the end of the year."


The 10-year Treasury yield closed at 4.22% Thursday, its highest close since June 2008. The yield is tracking toward its 12th straight weekly advance.


Q3 Earnings Season Continues
----------------------------


Besides economic data, the stock market had more earnings reports to digest. Many had positive reactions from investors.


**Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), Dow Jones member **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) were some of the bigger names.


Alcoa shares reversed from big losses to advance 3.4%. AT&T stock jumped 7.7%. [IBM climbed 4.7%.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-reporting-third-quarter-earnings/) [Lam Research](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lrcx-stock-lam-research-posts-beat-and-raise-report/) beat Wall Street's targets for the September quarter and guided higher for the current period. But it warned that U.S. export restrictions on China will hurt its sales next year. Lam shares surged 7.8%. On the downside, EV giant Tesla dived 6.7% to hit a new 52-week low.


**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) plunged almost 26% following Q3 results after the close Thursday. Up next, Dow Jones stocks **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) will report Friday morning.


Investors should continue to track companies that handily beat earnings results and have strong upside reactions. They could be among the stock market's leaders if the market is able to follow through higher.

Stock Market Today: Small Caps Struggle
---------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had rallied as much as 1.3% midday, declined 0.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.6%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 struggled, down 1.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, but appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks ended with moderate losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF fell 0.9%. The ETF snapped a three-day win streak, but is still above its Sept. 26 52-week low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) surged more than 6% after the [company's strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/steel-dynamics-nucor-earnings-due-as-this-steel-stock-shows-strength/). Shares are approaching a cup base's 88.72 buy point.


Stock Market Rally Attempt Awaits This Bullish Signal
-----------------------------------------------------


Thursday was Day 6 of the stock market's latest rally attempt, so investors are now patiently awaiting a [follow-through day.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) It would confirm the beginning of a new uptrend. Be mindful that not all follow-throughs work, so it's important to raise exposure slowly and methodically if the signal does come.


In the meantime, continue to build watchlists of top-performing stocks, like DoubleVerify and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)). Vertex Pharmaceuticals is eying a flat base's 306.05 buy point, with an early entry at 304.36. Shares are trying to find much-needed support around their 50-day line first.

DoubleVerify Is A Stock Market Leader
-------------------------------------


DoubleVerify is a potential stock market leader to watch during the market's rally attempt.


New York City-based [DoubleVerify provides](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/doubleverify-stock-plots-strong-relative-strength-line-amid-netflix-deal/) digital media measurement and data analytics. The company designs verification technology to help reduce ad fraud. It also promises to ensure placement of ads in safe and suitable environments for brands.


Meanwhile, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) last week [announced that its ad-supported service](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-analysts-debate-advertising-prospects/) — Basic With Ads — will launch Nov. 3 in the U.S. and will be available in 12 countries for $6.99 per month. The new streaming service plans to run four to five minutes of ads per hour.


Netflix said it had picked both DoubleVerify and IAS to provide independent measurement services for the new ad-supported offering.


In the latest quarter, adjusted earnings per share came in at 6 cents, vs. an 8-cent loss, as revenue rose 44% to $109.8 million. The company's third-quarter results are due out in early November. DoubleVerify is expected to earn 12 cents per share on sales of $109.2 million.

DV Stock Forms Flat Base
------------------------


DV stock climbed 0.5% Thursday, nearing a flat base's 30.02 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


The stock is showing impressive stock market outperformance during a volatile environment. The best way to view this positive divergence is to use the relative strength line, which continues to plod to new highs. An [RS line at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) during a stock market correction is a key indicator of technical strength.


Wait for a decisive move above the entry, along with a new stock market uptrend, before purchasing shares in the software leader.

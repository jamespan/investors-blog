Major Stock Indexes Gain Another Dubious Distribution Day
==========================================================

Stocks cooled off during a day of hot turnover Friday. The distribution-day count increased for a second time in a week, but the quadruple witching expiration of options and futures muddied the view. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%, ending a three-day win streak but giving back only a small portion of Thursday's 1.3% rise.

  

Thursday's gains marked an all-time high for the tech-dominated index, a feat that took more than 15 years to achieve.

  

The S&P 500 underperformed the Nasdaq, as it's done all year. It fell nearly 0.5% on Friday. The decline squeezed its year-to-date gain to almost 2.5%.

  

While the distribution-day count is now at six for both key indexes, most of those declines were mild in nature. The distribution days of May 26, in which both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped at least 1%, and May 29, which saw a jump in volume, are so far the only sessions that bore the emblem of unequivocally heavy selling.

  

The S&P 500 also remains above its key 50-day moving average. (See chart on B8.)

  

The fabless semiconductor industry suffered one of the day's worst declines, as noted in IBD's industry group rankings (at the bottom of Page B9). That drop impacted both the Nasdaq and S&P.

  

The top dog in the fabless space is **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), which has shown climax-run-style action in recent days. The GoPro and surveillance video camera chip technology provider fell nearly 6%. Volume surged 325% above average to 9.7 million shares, the highest level since Ambarella broke out of a base at 63.30 on March 4.

  

Big drops in massive volume usually indicate it's time to take some profits. Shareholders with a large cushion of gains can watch to see if Ambarella will form a new base. The stock also has a large air pocket above its 50-day line, currently near 87.

  

The S&P 500 suffered from sharp sell-offs among gold and silver mining, oil and gas field services, oil and gas exploration, metal ores and candy firms.

  

The IBD 50 lost 0.7%. But as the "Leaders up in volume" section showed, a fair number of top-rated stocks with ample daily turnover enjoyed solid gains on Friday.

  

That fact alone helps confirm the ongoing demand for equities among mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, banks and other institutional-class investors.

  

One might venture to say that the indexes' declines could have been a lot worse.

  

Equity traders in the U.S. awoke to news that the Shanghai stock exchange composite plunged 6.4%. The Shenzhen exchange's benchmark caved 5.9%. Observers blamed a load of new IPOs hitting the market, buoying the market's supply.

  

China's indexes have rocketed this year, in large part to relaxed regulations that now allow foreigners to invest in mainland China equities via the so-called Shanghai link. Domestic individual accounts have exploded this year.

  

What the finance leaders of the eurozone will do with its fiscally irresponsible member Greece is also creating confusion and fear. A "Grexit" would certainly be a big blow to the egos of eurozone architects and policymakers: Perhaps the market is already looking past the situation. After all, if the stability of the single-currency economic zone was so much in peril, the euro should be plunging by now. It's not.

  

Some indexes refused to bend lower. Small caps scratched higher, as the Russell 2000 was practically flat.

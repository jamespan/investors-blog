The stock market closed mixed on Friday but booked stout weekly gains ahead of the Martin Luther King Day holiday on Monday. Meanwhile, new U.S. retail sales data and more talk from Federal Reserve officials loom in the coming shortened week.




Major indexes were back to winning ways after last week's decline. The Nasdaq composite ended Friday flat but turned in a weekly rise of 3.1%. It has now risen in 10 out of the past 11 weeks and has pulled away from its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The tech-heavy index is fractionally negative so far in January.


The benchmark S&P 500 booked a daily gain of 0.1% and rose nearly 2% for the week. It is trading above its short-term moving averages and also climbed for the 10th time in the past 11 weeks. It is now slightly ahead for 2024.

UnitedHealth's medical-loss ratio, a key metric that measures health claim costs to insurers, came in larger than expected.


Small caps saw early gains melt away on the stock market as the Russell 2000 fell 0.2%. Growth stocks were also forced lower, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipping 0.3%.


Advancers had a slight edge on decliners on the New York Stock Exchange while the converse was true on the Nasdaq.


Retail Sales Data, Fedspeak Looms
---------------------------------


Stocks initially rose early in Friday's session after new producer price index data showed that prices fell 0.1% in the month of December. Year over year they were up 1%. This was below economist views on both counts. Core producer prices were flat on the month, with a 1.8% annual rise. It came a day after hotter-than-expected consumer price index data.


With the stock market closed on Monday to observe MLK Day, the workload will be lighter than usual. U.S. retail sales data is due early Wednesday while the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey drops Thursday.


There will also be a slew of talk from Federal Reserve officials, with the likes of district governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman as well as New York Fed President John Williams set to make public appearances.


More banks are getting set to post results as the earnings season heats up. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)),Â **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) are among those reporting in the coming week.

Stocks pounded the bears Thursday as the indexes piled on solid gains for the fourth time in the past five sessions.


The Nasdaq leapt 1.6%, while the S&P 500 added 1.2%. The IBD 50 popped 2%.


Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq.


Advancing issues led losers by ratios of 3-to-1 on the NYSE and 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq. On the IBD 50, gainers led by a 9-to-1 ratio.


The major indexes closed just under their 50-day moving averages, setting up a crucial test.


Further progress in the uptrend isn't possible without a move back above the 50-day lines.


Yet the indexes are showing confidence. Top-rated stocks are hitting new highs in strong volume. Others are breaking out.


With the market in a confirmed uptrend after Tuesday's follow-through, individual investors by now should've bought at least one breakout for testing purposes. If the breakout is working, additional buys are in order. If the breakout is stalling, stepping back is only prudent.


What if the market is working, but your stock isn't? In that case, you need to ask some tough questions.


Are the stock's fundamentals truly strong? Is it a leading stock in a leading group? Did it form a proper base and break out in strong volume? Did it have a prior 30% uptrend?


If the answer to any of those questions is no, then it could be time to find a stronger stock.


Some hesitant investors might still be on the sidelines. Although backing away from a follow-through day is an IBD rule violation, there's still time to act.


Investors need to look for buy opportunities in two areas: leaders that are still in the 5% buy zone and leaders that appear to be setting up for a breakout.


The first requires quick action. The second requires patience until a valid breakout occurs.


Recent breakouts still in buy zones include **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), though volume faded in the afternoon after Apple's breakout Thursday.


Stocks setting up for a potential breakout include **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and real estate services provider **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)).


This new uptrend is producing a fair amount of double-bottom bases, which are easy to overlook. For example, three of the five stocks mentioned above formed double bottoms â€” CBRE, Illumina and Taiwan Semiconductor.

U.S. stock indexes took opposite paths Thursday as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 advanced vigorously and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slouched just under the day's break-even line.




The Dow lost less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 climbed 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Small caps in the Russell 2000 added 0.8%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges vs. the previous session.


In the Dow, three stocks weighed on the index. **DowDuPont** ([DWDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DWDP)) dropped 9% on mixed Q4 results. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) hacked off 2% on management's [cautious comments](https://www.investors.com/research/mastercard-stock-mastercard-earnings-q4-visa-earnings-visa-stock/). And **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) trimmed 2% as the bank stocks sold off.

Solid Movers
------------


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) jumped about 11% in fast trade after topping the Street's view on earnings by almost 9%.


Business software provider **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) zoomed 13% to new highs in heavy volume. The big cap beat views by 20%.


**United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) [topped analysts' consensus estimate](https://www.investors.com/news/ups-earnings-q4-2018-ups-stock-fedex-amazon/) by 2%. The stock skipped 4% higher in brisk turnover.


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) popped 3.5% in strong volume. The payment processor delivered earnings 2% higher than expected.


Of those four, ServiceNow and Mastercard staged breakouts.

Breakouts Spread
----------------


Breakouts are picking up marketwide and among top-rated stocks, which is reinforcing the market's uptrend.


Stocks breaking out Thursday included business software developer **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) and customer contact software developer **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)).


New highs also are increasing. Stocks posting new highs Thursday included cloud security company **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), cybersecurity firm **Rapid7** ([RPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RPD)) and coffee giant **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), though it reversed to close lower.


Trump Tweets On Trade
---------------------


With the Federal Reserve easing market fears Wednesday, the main worry left is the China-U.S. trade negotiations.


President Donald Trump tweeted that he was looking for China to go beyond opening its markets to financial services. Trump called on China to expand the opening to manufacturing, farming and other U.S. industries.


"Without this a deal would be unacceptable!" Trump tweeted.


Hedge Funds Quiet In January
----------------------------


Within the confines of the market itself, other factors could potentially play into the current stock market. Bloomberg News reported that hedge funds were quiet and risk-averse in January.


The Nasdaq pocketed an almost 10% gain for the month, while the S&P 500 and the Dow booked about 8% and 7%, respectively.


If the indexes continue to advance, the hedge funds will likely get active and "juice the current rally," Bloomberg News reported.

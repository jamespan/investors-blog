Commodity Stocks Send S&P 500 Lower; Nasdaq Gets Stall Day
===========================================================

The stock market's attempt to rebound for a second straight session fizzled in afternoon trading Tuesday. News of a canceled marquee soccer match in the German city of Hanover rattled investors.

  

The S&P 500 squandered an intraday gain of almost 0.7% to end down by a little more than 0.1%. NYSE volume grew.

  

Since the S&P 500's loss was smaller than the 0.2% minimum required for a distribution day, Tuesday's decline does not count as such.

  

In fact, the distribution count for the large-cap index decreased to five after the Oct. 13 distribution day expired on time.

  

The Nasdaq composite closed slightly up, yet it still picked up a sixth distribution day over the past 25 trading sessions.

  

The tech-centered index's gain shrank from nearly 0.8% to less than 0.1%. Volume was thin vs. its 50-day average, yet crept mildly higher. That increase, combined with the poor finish by the Nasdaq and other factors, met the IBD definition of a stalling day.

  

When a market stalls, it means institutional investors are selling shares into a rally with abandon. The heavy selling impedes a market's upward progress.

  

Stocks peaked before noon ET as news reports surfaced about the canceled match between the German and Dutch national squads. Reuters quoted the Hanover police chief as saying authorities had received "specific indications that an attack with explosives was planned."

  

Tuesday's action was indeed disappointing. The S&P 500 clearly showed resistance near its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq was aiming to return above the 5,000 level for the first time in three sessions.

  

The Nasdaq has now been saddled with four distribution days in six sessions â€” further justification for investors to keep a cautious stance. But leading stocks didn't behave that badly. In turn, gold, steel, solar, agriculture and other commodity stocks dominated the decline.

  

As the Market Pulse shows, the enterprise software space remained a magnet for institutional demand.

  

**Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)), a small-cap software firm serving insurance firms, gapped up nearly 5% to 37.03 in volume that jumped 73% above average. It's seeking to clear a base with a 38.14 buy point and already has cleared an alternative entry at 34.51.

  

Taiwanese microcontroller chip design firm **Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)), another company in the $1 billion range in market value, rallied 2% to 32.39 in heavy trade. It's formed a cup with handle, giving a 32.94 buy point.

  

The Philly SOX gained 0.6%.

  

Amid a flurry of economic data, perhaps the 0.2% rise in October consumer prices stood out the most. The Federal Reserve continues to seek affirmation that both the economy and inflation are rising enough to justify the end of its virtually free-money policy. Its last meeting of the year is just a month away, Dec. 15-16.

  

The Dow utilities, a collection of stocks highly sensitive to interest rates, sank 1.7%.

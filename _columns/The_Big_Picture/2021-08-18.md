Investors hoping the stock market would settle down saw lazy action in the major indexes Wednesday, extending a dull trend in which growth stocks are having a hard time rallying.




Indexes saw quiet trading much of the day, then weakened after the Federal Reserve put out minutes of its July meeting. A consensus is growing among Fed policymakers to [start unwinding the monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-debated-timing-mechanics-of-stimulus-pullback-at-july-meeting-11629309648?mod=hp_lead_pos1).


The stock market is now convinced the tapering will happen, and it's only a question of when it will start and how fast it will unfold. The July meeting minutes showed Fed members remain divided on exactly how to act.


"Looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year," sometime in the coming months, [the minutes read](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf).


Fed Divided On Taper
--------------------


Still, several other Fed members felt that a slowing in asset purchases was more appropriate early next year because they believe the labor market is still not strong enough.


![MP081821](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP081821-236x300.jpg)The stock market loves easy money, and signs of tapering have cooled the market's risk appetite the past several months. That's certainly not the only risk (Covid and inflation are others). And keep in mind, the S&P 500 has more than doubled from its March 23, 2020, bottom while sustaining nary a correction of more than 6% since last October.


The Nasdaq corrected 13% in February to early March and 9% in May. You have to wonder if there's excess froth to work off. This market, it seems, is working overtime.


Indexes closed near session lows. The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, closing below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since July 19. The Nasdaq lost 0.9% and is now testing its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1% and also landed below its 21-day line.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. So, the stock market escaped a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Also, the July 14 distribution day (a stalling session that day) is no longer in the books after 25 sessions passed.


Most Stock Market Sectors Fall
------------------------------


Every S&P sector ETF fell except for Consumer Discretionary Sector Select SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)), which bounced 0.4% but remained below its 50-day line. The sector fell after mixed earnings.



**Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) roared nearly 10% higher after the [home improvement chain beat profit and sales estimates](https://www.barrons.com/articles/lowes-earnings-stock-51629294693?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D86767752584359609670535559432365936577%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1629320596). The stock is forming a [saucer base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/).


But **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) fell 2.8% in heavy trading although the company [beat earnings estimates and offered a solid outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-target-earnings-q2-2021/), despite slowing in-store and online growth. Target also set a $15 billion stock buyback program. The stock closed slightly below the 50-day moving average. A buy area would emerge if shares can rebound above the line.


Energy was weakest sector, down 2.1% after the price of U.S. crude slid $1.13, or 1.7%, to $65.46 per barrel. Transports, semiconductors, small caps and other broad indexes also fell.


But the IBD 50 outperformed, even if it was with a gain of less than 0.1%. Strong days for **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **Doximity** ([DOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCS)), **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)), **Upstart Holdings** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) and new issue **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) gave the index a boost. TaskUs shot up nearly 9% to a new high.

Leading Stocks Need Strong Stock Market
---------------------------------------


Such stellar performances offer hopes for growth investors. An old Wall Street refrain says never short a dull market. But it's hard to make a full commitment to stocks when the market is lacking vigor, even if it's technically in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/).


Chinese stocks tried to rebound Wednesday. Invesco Golden Dragon China ([PGJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGJ)) broke a six-day losing streak with a 1.6% bounce. It's still near the lowest close since May 28, 2020.


**Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) rallied 3.7% after the [internet company reported mixed second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tencent-earnings-q2-2021-top-china-crackdown/) early Wednesday. Tencent and other major Chinese tech companies face a crackdown from Beijing.


Homebuilding stocks were modestly lower after new home construction fell in July following two months of increases, the Commerce Department said. Housing starts fell 7% in July from June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.534 million. The total missed forecasts for a fall of 3.2% to an annual pace of 1.59 million. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose 2.6% in July, above views.

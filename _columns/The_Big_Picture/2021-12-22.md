The stock market ended higher Wednesday, as the major indexes extended Tuesday's gains. But the Nasdaq remains at a key resistance level. With the market improving, four top growth stocks — **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — are in new buy zones.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 rallied 1%. The Nasdaq advanced 1.2%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.9%. All four stock indexes finished at session highs.


Leading growth stocks also rose sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.9%, adding to Tuesday's 3.4% advance. But the ETF of top growth stocks remains below the 200-day moving average.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock and [IPO Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) **Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)) climbed 2.4%, extending its win streak to four sessions. The biotech is rapidly approaching a cup base's 44.49 buy point.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. Tuesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP122221-280x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied sharply for a second straight day Wednesday, but has yet to decisively clear a key resistance level — its 50-day moving average. The composite's previous retake of that level on Dec. 15 ended abruptly the following session, when the index tumbled 2.5%.


Despite two days of strength, IBD's market outlook remains at a cautionary "uptrend under pressure." Until the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) moves back into a confirmed uptrend, investors should still be mostly on the sidelines due to a whipsaw market environment. But some top stocks aren't waiting for a confirmed uptrend to break out. Investors can make purchases, but be aware that risk is higher at this point.


Continue to maintain watchlists of top growth stocks. Use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to find the next market cycle's leaders. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.

Stocks To Watch: Arista, Icon, AMD, Nvidia
------------------------------------------


During Wednesday's stock market rally, top growth stocks Arista Networks and Icon showed signs of market-beating strength. Meanwhile, chip leaders AMD and Nvidia are trying to rebound from their 50-day moving averages.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock Arista Networks is moving further above a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/)'s 134.24 buy point following Wednesday's 1.2% gain. The 5% buy area tops out at 140.95, so the stock is trading at the top of the range. [ANET stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-arista-networks-inc-anet.aspx) shows a strong 97 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/), according to the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Icon is breaking out past a 301.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a consolidation, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares surged 7.2%, ending in the 5% buy area, which runs to 316.91. Per Leaderboard commentary, Icon also cleared resistance around 290, which served as an early entry. Icon specializes in contract-based clinical research for the biotech and pharmaceutical industries.


Chip giants Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia closed back above their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) following Tuesday's strong rebounds, placing both stock market leaders in new buy areas. But AMD stock ended 0.3% lower Wednesday. Nvidia advanced 1.1%, adding to Tuesday's 4.9% gain. Remember that a volatile stock market should have you in a more conservative mindset.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high Thursday, as the stock market rotation continued. The Nasdaq closed higher after reversing from early losses, searching for support at a key level.




The Nasdaq rallied 0.4% Thursday. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the Dow Jones industrials gained 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was flat.


Leading growth stocks sharply underperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 2.1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)) was one of the few winners. It surged nearly 6%, moving further up the right side of a new cup base with a 279.56 buy point.


Volume ended higher on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP050620-239x300.jpg)The Nasdaq snapped a four-day losing streak Thursday after reversing from sharp losses. The tech-heavy composite is trying to find support at its critical 50-day moving average. A decisive rebound from this level would be bullish for the health of the stock market uptrend, which has faltered. The losing streak saw IBD's market outlook shift into an "uptrend under pressure" on Tuesday.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrials hit record highs and the S&P 500 lingered just off its own all-time high.


The overall [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains moderate. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have four days of higher-volume declines. With rising levels of institutional selling and many leading stocks struggling, investors should be more conservative.

Stocks To Watch: Deere, Goldman, Teck Resources
-----------------------------------------------


Cyclical and financial stocks are in favor as the stock market goes through a sector rotation. That shift has left technology and growth stocks underperforming.


[Wednesday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/deere-stock-de-near-buy-point-300-percent-run-ark-cathie-wood-owns-it-too/) pick, **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), is rapidly approaching a 392.52 buy point in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis.](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) Shares gained 2.9% Thursday.


According toÂ [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Deere stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-deere-and-co-de.aspx) shows a strong 95 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/). Deere is a new [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock.


Dow Jones leader and [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) staged a breakout Wednesday past a flat base's 356.96 buy point and added to those gains Thursday with a 2.3% advance. Shares are in a 5% buy area that goes up to 374.81.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is just off new highs, indicating strong stock market outperformance despite the mixed stock market action. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter.

Per Leaderboard commentary, "The latest base is third stage. That's not optimal, but natural resources stocks like Teck are in favor right now as the global economy recovers from the pandemic."

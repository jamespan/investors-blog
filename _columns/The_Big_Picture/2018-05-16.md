Every once in a while, the so-called mighty mites of Wall Street show a triumphant performance. Wednesday was such a day.




The S&P SmallCap 600 celebrated all that's good with smaller companies amid a time when the threat of increasing trade tariffs, a slow-yet-steady rise in the cost of borrowing money, more expensive oil, and global synchronous economic growth dominate the minds of most portfolio managers around the country. The S&P 600 rallied 1.2% and pushed into new all-time highs.


At the session high of 997.80, the S&P 600 has now climbed as much as 6.5% since Jan. 1.


The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, more than a nearly 0.3% lift for the Dow Jones industrial average and inferior to the Nasdaq's 0.6% rise. The Russell 2000, the other major small-cap index, rose 1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP051618-220x300.jpg)At 2722, the S&P 500 is now up 1.8% for the year. That may be a source of frustration for index investors. Active stock investors, however, have every reason to embrace the current market conditions. Sure, there have been a few months' of nasty spills that resulted in a downgrade in IBD's market outlook to "correction" from "confirmed uptrend." Yet the volatility in today's equities market is normal when you compare it with the halcyon days of 2017.


The gains by the major indexes mask the sizable breadth of the market's ongoing advance.


40 Big Movers
-------------


View the 197 industry groups today, and you'll find that no fewer than 40 groups waged rallies of 1.6% or more. That's one-fifth of the stock market universe. Nearly two dozen groups rolled 2% higher or more. They spanned the industrial gamut, from steel producers to data storage, apparel retail to semiconductor equipment, restaurants to oil drilling.


Check the daily performance of all 197 industry groups by going to the [Data Tables section](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) within Stock Lists on the homepage. Don't forget that up to half of a true market leader's run is fueled by the power of its industry group and broader sector.



In a [Stock Market Today column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-chips-lead-stocks-today-up-will-this-industry-group-provide-more-tasty-trading-profits/) earlier on Wednesday, IBD noted how **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is attempting a very hard thing to do: become a market leader in two separate bull runs. Today, the burrito and taco chain is a classic turnaround story. Not long ago, it suffered a massive public relations debacle following a series of food poisoning incidents at some restaurants.


Chipotle became the latest addition to [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/). Wall Street sees the firm's earnings growing 28% to $8.59 a share this year after a big rebound of 425% in 2017.


Indeed, Chipotle is just one example of scores of stocks that represent a shift of more money into retail and consumer discretionary names.


Don't Ignore The Potential Of Big Turnarounds
---------------------------------------------


**Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) is still in the fight of its corporate life to stay relevant in the new golden age of e-commerce. Yet for now, can you believe that its relative price strength rating has rebounded to a 91? Would you like an even more shocking number? Macy's now holds a 95 Composite Rating on [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-macys-inc-m.aspx). That places it in the top shelf of IBD's Retail-Department Stores group.


The stock rose back above a prior 31.08 buy point in a first-stageÂ [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/). The department store chain has turned its struggling top line around, raising sales 2% and 4% in the past two quarters. Earnings jumped sharply in the past three quarters (up 35%, 108%, 250%) with the help of major store closures and corporate restructuring.


Another Mighty Mite In Software
-------------------------------


The Market Pulse serves up a few examples of the mighty mites that are crushing the indexes. **Altair Engineering** ([ALTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALTR)), a member of IBD's specialty enterprise software group, added nearly 5%, to 35.16, in triple the average volume. On Tuesday, the stock moved past a 33.48 entry in a seven-week cup without handle.


Altair went public at 13 a share in November 2017. Despite more than doubling in price, the stock carries a lightweight market value of $2.2 billion.


Research from William O'Neil + Co. shows that within the S&P SmallCap 600, the market values range from as low as $66 million (**Fred's** ([FRED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRED))) to as high as $5.5 billion (**Integra LifeSciences** ([IART](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IART))). The median market cap: $1.4 billion. Median average dollar volume: $14 million per day.


Volume fell just 1% both the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday and nearly 3% on the NYSE. Following Tuesday's distribution day, you'd much prefer to see the indexes rise in heavier volume, not lighter turnover.



However, this element of Wednesday's action was bullish: Among the leaders that fell substantially, they mostly fell in light volume. Check out the likes of **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)), and **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)). All of these IBD 50 members show no chinks in their armor. All three are riding on the north side of their rising 50-day moving averages.


Want more proof? Let's browse through the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Only one stock in that entire list fell in above-average turnover: **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)). Hardly a dent to its uptrend. Volume rose just 3% above its 50-day average. The stock deserves a rest after climbing significantly above the rising 50-day line. But it is below the 167.46 buy point of an [awkward flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Across the entire market, winners beat losers by a nearly 2-1 margin on both the Nasdaq and the Big Board.

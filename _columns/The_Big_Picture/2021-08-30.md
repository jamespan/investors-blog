Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit New Highs; Stock Market Too High? This Data Says No
========================================================================

Another day, another record high for the stock market.




The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and Nasdaq composite added 0.9% as both indexes made their fifth new high in the past six sessions. Indexes are clearing major price levels, too: The S&P 500 closed above the 4500 for the second day in a row, and the Nasdaq is adding some room above the 15,000 milestone.


Stock market results were mixed, however. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose financial components sputtered, edged down almost 0.2%. Nasdaq volume edged higher and trading appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


After outperforming the main indexes last week with a 5% jump, the Russell 2000 lagged Monday. It fell 0.5% and closed near session lows. Weakness in financials (the largest Russell 2000 sector weight with more than 21% of assets) hurt the small-cap benchmark.


![MP083021](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP083021-227x300.jpg)Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) slipped 1.4% Monday and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) dropped 2.4%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3 basis points to 1.29% and may be hitting resistance at the converged 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


Stock Market Indexes Stretched
------------------------------


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq look a bit stretched, now trading 3% to 4% above their 50-day moving averages. If the past 10 months are any indication, investors need to be watching for a pullback.


With one day left in August, the S&P 500 is on track for its seventh consecutive monthly gain, the best streak since a 10-month run from April 2017 to January 2018. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace for the ninth monthly gain in the past 10 months.


The stock market looks frothy, especially when viewed through the weekly and monthly charts. Yet, the indexes continue their remarkable 2021 rally.


The S&P 500 made its 53rd record high of the year Monday. That's the most record closes through August in history, says Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. At the start of the week, all S&P sectors were positive year to date, led by a 34% increase for financials and 33% for energy.


"On the surface, the last three years have little in common from a fundamental perspective, but all three had accommodative central bank policy growing fiscal spending and a lack of attractive alternatives to equities," Hackett wrote in a report. "Equity markets continue to have tailwinds from central bank liquidity, strong economic growth, accelerating earnings expectations, aggressive share buybacks and a buy-the-dip mentality of investors."


History Favors Stock Market
---------------------------


Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, says the data still supports a bullish outlook for the stock market.


When the S&P 500 is up more than 15% year to date at the end of August (it's now up 20.6%), the final four months have been up the past five times. The last three years that happened, the S&P 500 rose 9.6%, 7.9%, and 10.4% in the last four months.


"In fact, the average return in the final four months after a great start to the year is 4.2%, with a very impressive median return of 5.2%," Detrick said in a note Monday.


Granted, the stock market may go through some moderate pullbacks even if it follows history again. Investors need to stay in tune with the day to day action in the market.


The IBD 50 rose 0.8% Monday and also is on track for the ninth gain in the past 10 months. On Monday, a group of volatile but high-performance new issues helped the IBD 50 outperform. **Global-e Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)), **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) each surged more than 7% to new highs.


All three are way [extended past a proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).



Rotation in sector performance is one reason the stock market has been able to sustain its advance this year. Each wave of leadership is bringing its own opportunities. In the past three months, technology, internet, real estate and health care are leading sectors. Cyclicals have lagged this summer.


Sporting Goods, Shipping Worth Watching
---------------------------------------


Investors should watch the sporting goods and shipping industries. In the former, **Dick's Sporting Goods**' ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) post-earnings rally sparked peers **Academy Sports & Outdoors** ([ASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASO)) and **Big Five Sporting Goods** ([BGFV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGFV)).


In shipping, **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) is in buy range from a 47.94 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/invehttps://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/stors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) and is an industry leader. Pacific Ocean shipper **Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)) broke out to new highs Monday. **Navios Maritime Partners** ([NMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMM)) is rebounding above its 50-day line.

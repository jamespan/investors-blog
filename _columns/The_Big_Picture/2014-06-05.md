Stocks Pop Into Higher Gear As Uptrend Gains Lift
==================================================

The market shifted into a higher gear Thursday as the indexes posted sizable gains in rising volume.

  

The Nasdaq advanced 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7%. The small-cap S&P 600 leapt 2%. The IBD 50 added 0.4%.

  

Volume was higher on both major exchanges.

  

The advance in higher volume was impressive in light of Friday's looming jobs report. A more wary market might have waited for the payroll and unemployment report, which will be released before Friday's opening bell.

  

With the confirmed uptrend eight sessions old (including the follow-through day May 27), investors are finding some quality stocks to buy.

  

On the follow-through day, chip designer **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) broke out. The stock is now extended.

  

Other stocks beyond the 5% buy zone include **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)).

  

On Thursday, **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) broke out, clearing a 161.10 buy point in heavy volume. While this uptrend hasn't yet enjoyed a flood of breakouts, a concentrated portfolio needs only a handful of good stocks to drive returns.

  

Apart from buying opportunities, breakouts serve as building blocks for a market uptrend.

  

Every uptrend must shift through various gears. In the first few days after a follow-through, the market's low-gear goal is to move forward and avoid shifting into reverse. An early distribution day can be deadly to an uptrend.

  

This uptrend already passed the first-gear test. Neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 has suffered any distribution recently.

  

Second gear involves quality breakouts and signs of accumulation in the indexes. This is where the uptrend is now, and it's still a work in progress. On Thursday, the indexes delivered their first day of accumulation since the follow-through day.

  

Accumulation points to institutional buying.

  

Additional signs of accumulation and breakouts are necessary if this uptrend is to reach a cruising gear. The market isn't there yet, which is fortunate: There is still time to buy stocks.

  

Individual investors who wait too long to buy in an uptrend can fall victim to chasing extended stocks, a good way to lose money.

  

Yet, there's no guarantee that this uptrend will be successful. It's still early in the game and anything can happen. IBD-style investors should continue to track the market's action, even as they add more exposure.

  

From the bearish side of the Street, those betting against this rally have to be getting a little nervous. Going into Thursday's session, the NYSE short interest ratio was at 4.72, not far from its five-year high of 4.77.

  

If this uptrend continues to work, it could get a nice bonus if the bears are forced to buy shares to cover their shorts.

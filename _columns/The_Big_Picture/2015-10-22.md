Stocks took a bold turn Thursday, rising in fast trade and keeping virtually all of the day's sizable gains. The Nasdaq gained 1.6%, the S&P 500 thrust 1.7% higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average booked a 1.9% gain.

  

**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) had a 8% romp that boosted the Dow after the fast-food king reported better-than-expected quarterly results.

  

Small caps trailed the major indexes, with the Russell 2000 adding only 0.8%. The IBD 50 checked in with a 0.6% pop.

  

Volume was decisively higher on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.

  

The indexes' sizable gains in growing volume pointed to accumulation, which is the footprint of institutional buying.

  

While the Nasdaq carries five days of distribution, the quality of distribution can matter as well as the count. Two days came on easy comparisons â€” i.e., trade the day before was freakishly low.

  

This makes for a murkier read than if volume had been normal.

  

However, if light distribution days continue to pile up, they still could weigh down the market uptrend like tiny snacks to the belly.

  

On Thursday, big-cap stocks were throwing their weight around. Gainers led losers by a 4-to-1 ratio in the Big Cap 20.

  

Twelve of the 20 stocks rose by 2% or more, and eight marked new 52-week highs.

  

Big Cap 20 stock **Dr Pepper Snapple** ([DPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPS)) finished a job it started two weeks ago. Earlier this month, the stock cleared and again cleared an 83.67 buy point in low volume. On Thursday, big volume kicked in, and the stock closed 7% above the entry.

  

An individual investor had to be watching the stock closely to get in before Pepper left the 5% buy zone. The stock stayed in the buy zone for the first 15 minutes of the session, and then it was gone.

  

Earnings no doubt drove much of the action Thursday, but other factors weighed in as well.

  

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi hinted at more stimulus measures in Europe.

  

In the U.S., existing home sales, the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index and first-time jobless claims were sunnier than expected. But the Chicago Fed activity index and leading indicators missed views.

  

After hours, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) rose 7% to 11% on quarterly results.

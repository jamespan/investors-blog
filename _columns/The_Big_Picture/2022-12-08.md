The stock market rebounded Thursday, as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 snapped extended losing streaks. **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) reported their quarterly results after the close, while key inflation data is due out Friday morning.




In other notable action, IBD 50 stock **Allegro MicroSystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) are near buy points.


Jobless Claims Rise; Inflation Data On Deck
-------------------------------------------


Ahead of Thursday's open, the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims rose slightly more than expected to 230,000 vs. 225,000 in the prior week, above the 228,000 consensus estimate.


On Friday before the market opens, wholesale inflation data is due, with the release of the Producer Price Index. Producer prices are expected to rise 0.2% for the month of November, resulting in a 7.2% year-over-year increase.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 3.49% Thursday. On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield tumbled to 3.4%, its lowest close since Sept. 12. Meanwhile, investors place a 79% chance of a 50-basis-point rate hike at next week's Federal Reserve meeting, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).

Earnings Reports: Ciena, Costco, Lululemon
------------------------------------------


Earnings reports Thursday included **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) and **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)).


[Ciena stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ciena-stock-ciena-earnings-q32022/) soared nearly 20%, retaking its long-term 200-day moving average, which it has been below since April. Still, shares remain more than 30% off their 52-week high. Ciena reported October-quarter profit and revenue that easily topped analyst estimates as supply chain problems eased. Management forecast fiscal 2023 revenue growth for Ciena in a range of 16% to 18%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP120822-274x300.jpg)GameStop shares jumped more than 11%, but they remain below their 50-day line. The video game retailer posted another quarterly loss and sales for the October quarter fell 8%.


Key earnings reports after the close Thursday were Costco and Lululemon. Costco shares slipped more than 1%, while Lululemon stock dived around 10% in extended trade.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite bounced 1.1%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.6%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


Amid this week's wobbly stock market, investors should maintain their cautious stance. For now, the Nasdaq is holding its 50-day line, but further weakness on the tech-heavy composite would send it below that benchmark, which is an important support level to monitor. A breach of that level would likely lead to more downside.


Meanwhile, some promising breakouts, like **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), have seen their gains disappear during the stock market's recent losing streak. This week, ANET stock declined as much 6.2% below a 132.97 buy point after being up as much as 5.9%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) moved down less than 0.3% Thursday, as the ETF trades just off its 52-week low. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), chip stocks featured prominently among the top performers. **Lattice Semiconductors** ([LSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSCC)), **Microchip** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) and **Onsemi** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) rose 3.3%, 2.1% and 2.9%, respectively.


[China stocks jumped Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-stock-jumps-china-eases-covid-restrictions-baba/) as that nation's government officials curtailed many of its zero-Covid controls that stalled the world's second-largest economy. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) rallied 6.6%, while shares of **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) climbed 3.3% and 5%, respectively. IShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) rose 3.1%.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) skidded as much as 2.9% before cutting losses to 0.3% [amid reports the EV giant](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-falters-on-latest-report-of-china-production-slow-down/) is reducing worker shifts and pausing new employee onboarding at its Shanghai factory. Tesla shares are just off their 2022 lows.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Allegro, Dexcom
----------------------------------------------


Allegro MicroSystems is in buy range past a cup-with-handle's 32.07 buy point after Thursday's 2.5% advance. Keep in mind there is reason for handling this breakout with some caution, given the lack of a handle on the weekly chart. ALGM stock was featured in one of this week's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch columns.](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-to-watch-chip-leader-allegro-microsystems-breaks-out-but-theres-reason-for-caution/)


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Dexcom is trying to break out past a 123.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a flat base amid a three-day win streak, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares finished Thursday up 4%, just shy of the newest buy point. Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is holding just off its recent highs following the stock's price surge in late October.


Dexcom makes continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetics. And the device maker recently [won FDA approval for  a new monitoring device](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dexcom-stock-surges-after-winning-fda-ok-for-next-generation-diabetes-device/).

After a bullish reversal Thursday, the stock-market bears came back Friday and clobbered any optimists still holding firm.




It was a rough week for optimists.


The Nasdaq started the shortened week trying to build on the previous week's 5.6% thrust. The gain was largely rubbed out with a 4.9% loss for the week, which included a 3% loss Friday.


Small caps did worse, incurring a 6% dent for the week in the S&P 600, including a 1.9% loss Friday. On the technical front, the small-cap S&P 600 undercut its late-October low.

Volume was down on both major exchanges Friday and also down for the four-day week, according to preliminary data. The stock market closed Wednesday in honor of former President George H.W. Bush, who died Nov. 30.


Apart from defensive sectors, few are escaping damage.


Retail Loses Its Shine
----------------------


Retail was a sector that shined for a while in this tough market but could not sustain the leadership role.


Upscale retail, which tends to enjoy price insensitivity, ran into trouble.


**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), for instance, plunged 14% for the week. This was its biggest weekly percentage loss in more than a year and a half.


Late Thursday, Lululemon reported [fiscal Q3 results that beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q3-holiday-outlook-buy-point/) on the top and bottom lines.


The company's outlook was in line with expectations. But these days few good reports go unpunished.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) dived almost 15% for the week.


In the week ended Nov. 9, Ulta Beauty looked like a leader, breaking out with a 9% gain for the week. But shares plunged 13% Friday after the company [gave a weak holiday-quarter outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/ulta-beauty-earnings-ulta-beauty-stock/).


News Is The Culprit
-------------------


What would it take to turn this market into a bullish machine?


News has been the culprit in this shaky market. President Trump's trade war with China continues to weigh on the bulls, despite a 90-day timeout. In the U.K., the Brexit deal is expected to fail in the House of Commons early next week.


Interest rates and the Federal Reserve's stance is another worry, despite Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's recent attempts to quiet the storm.


The market appears rattled over the possibility of a yield inversion despite research that says [the stock market often advances](https://www.investors.com/news/yield-curve-stock-market/) for 19 months on average after an inversion.


More than anything, the market needs normalcy. So far in Q4, the news has been anything but normal.

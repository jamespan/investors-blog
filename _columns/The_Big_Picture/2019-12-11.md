Stock Market Rises After Dovish Fed Statement; Semiconductor Stocks Power Higher
=================================================================================

The stock market traded in orderly fashion again Wednesday, ending with mild gains, as Wall Street digested another dovish Federal Reserve policy statement. Semiconductor stocks enjoyed another day of outperformance as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite continue to trade tightly near highs.




VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) notched an all-time high, up 2.1% in strong volume. Inside the Nasdaq 100, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) jumped nearly 4% to 49.26. It's vying for a breakout from a base with a 50 buy point. In the chip-equipment group, Nasdaq 100 components **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) continue to show supporting action at their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) after breakouts. Same with [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) name **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)).


The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.4%, the S&P 500 rallied 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrials inched up 0.1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly lower than Tuesday.


The Nasdaq held up well despite some selling in the software sector. Several software-related groups lagged, but enterprise software leaders like **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) aren't breaking down by any means. In the database software group, **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) continues to trade tightly near highs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP121119-237x300.jpg)The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) remains elevated, but when it comes to overall market health, the price action of leading growth stocks is what matters most. In this vein, the bullish thesis still holds. Also remember that of the Nasdaq's six distribution days, just one was indicative of meaningful institutional selling. That was when the index slumped 1.1% on Dec. 2 in higher volume.


What The Fed Said
-----------------


The two-day [Federal Reserve meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-dow-jones-reaction-3-big-questions/) concluded Wednesday and the Fed's policy statement once again revealed a Federal Open Market Committee that's in no rush raise the federal funds rate, which is currently at 1.5% to 1.75%.


The Fed's median estimate for the Fed funds rate at the end of 2020 is 1.6%; 1.9% in 2021 and 2.1% in 2022. Thirteen members of the committee expect rates to stay on hold next year, while four see a hike as appropriate.


Fed policymakers see their favored gauge of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rising 1.6% this year, 1.9% in 2020 and 2% in 2021.


Meanwhile, the stock market is in wait-and-see mode regarding the Dec. 15 tariff deadline. That's when additional tariffs on roughly $156 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect unless there's a preliminary trade deal with China.


That the stock market continues to hold near highs amid China trade uncertainty says a lot about the strength of the uptrend. Indeed, the stock market's focus now is on a healthy U.S. economy, boosted by low unemployment, strong consumer spending and tame inflation.

According to Investors Intelligence, bullish sentiment among newsletter writers has been declining in recent weeks, but that's actually good news for the bulls. Bullish sentiment is now at 53.3%, down from a prior reading of 54.8% and a reading of 58.1% before that. Falling bullishness is actually good news for stock market bulls because it's a contrarian indicator. The thinking is that the crowd is often wrong when timing the market.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) shares gained ground for the fourth straight session but ended off session highs. The stock is still in position for a breakout try over a 361.30 [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares were strong after a German newspaper said the company plans to produce 500,000 vehicles a year at its new factory in Germany. Separately, Reuters reported that Tesla plans to increase prices of imported Model 3 vehicles in China in January.

After a strong rally for the major stock indexes, good bases are getting more difficult to find because a lot of leaders have broken out already. But retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) has been working its way higher, building the right side of a cup-shaped base.


It's still OK to stay on the hunt for stock building bases, but equally compelling buy opportunities can be found in stocks showing tight price action after a breakout or stocks finding support at their 10-week moving average for the first or second time after a breakout.

  Stock Indexes Sag To Small Losses; Is Homebuilder Leader Ready To Break Out?

U.S. stocks strayed little from the break-even line Thursday, as the market kept calm for a second day after Tuesday's big sell-off.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each crept 0.1% lower, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average ended flat. The small-cap Russell 2000 perked up 0.6%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.

While small caps outperformed the market Thursday as they did in the weeks after the November election, the lead has long since disappeared. Year to date, the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq has gained 8%. The Russel also has been trading below its 50-day moving average.


Bank stocks also have lost thrust. The big money-center banks surged 19% from Election Day to year end, but the group has been flat so far in 2017.


As the banks fade, homebuilders have risen, up 20% year to day.


On Thursday, however, banks and homebuilders were both showing gains. Homebuilders rode a bullish report on new home sales for February. The Street expected 565,000 but the figure came in almost 5% higher at 592,000.


Bank stocks meanwhile were repairing part of the damage from Tuesday's sell-off. All seven bank industry groups were up from 0.4% to 1.3%.


Market watchers will be locked onto the bank stocks, watching to see if the bulls can regain control.


Homebuilders Up; D.R. Horton Adds Handle
----------------------------------------


Homebuilders handled the market's recent sell-off very well. The group fell 1% Tuesday, was almost flat Wednesday but rose 0.8% Thursday.


Homebuilder stocks either in a buy zone or not far off their highs include **William Lyon Homes** ([WLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLH)), **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)), **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), **CalAtlantic Group** ([CAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAA)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)).


D.R. Horton, the leader in the group by market cap, on Thursday completed the five-session minimum length for a handle. This lowers the potential buy point from 34.66 to 34.15. A crossing of the buy point in strong volume would validate a buy opportunity.


**KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) reported quarterly results after the close. Earnings rose 7% to 15 cents a share, topping views for 13 cents which would've been a 7% decline. Revenue rose about 21% vs. expectations for an 18% gain.


Health Care Deals Knuckleball To Market
---------------------------------------


D.C. politics is throwing a knuckleball to the stock market.


The intramural Republican standoff on the health care bill, which was scheduled for a vote Thursday but postponed, matters to the stock market for several reasons.


First, the fight is creating uncertainty, which the market hates. The uncertainty is especially troubling because it's an all-Republican show. If the GOP can't find unity among themselves on health care, the discord could stall other economic issues.


Second, the Trump-backed bill is not the radical surgery that free-market types would prefer. In that camp, the thinking is that government-managed health care — whether it's called ObamaCare, RyanCare or TrumpCare — is likely to become, over time, a problem-fix-problem cycle that never gets solved, just repeated and kicked down the road.


Third, other issues — perhaps more important to the stock market, such as cuts in corporate taxes, cuts in individual taxes and a repeal of Dodd-Frank — could be delayed.


The chatter about a delay on the tax issues, though, might be exaggerated. Reagan's 1981 tax cuts weren't signed into law until August, about seven months after he took office, and Reagan didn't get everything he sought. Trump still could match or beat that August target.


The Nasdaq's Stock Chart
------------------------


The Nasdaq's low close in the day's range was a sign of weakness. But lower volume took away some of the sting.


The Nasdaq could be setting up for its second test of the 50-day line since early December. After closing below the line Dec. 1, the Nasdaq advanced more than 12% over three months.


Other Economic News
-------------------


Apart from the bullish news on February new-home sales, other economic news was mixed.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 258,000 worse than the 240,000 expected and above the highest estimate in the range, which was 245,000.


Meanwhile, the Kansas City Federal Reserve's manufacturing gauge for March rose from 14 to 20. Readings above zero indicate growth.

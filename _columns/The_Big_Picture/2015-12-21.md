Flurry Of Buying Lifts Stocks Late; Volume Lacks Punch
=======================================================

A flurry of buying in the last half-hour of trading Monday lifted stocks to session highs.Â  Volume was light as stocks kicked off a shortened week. The Nasdaq added 0.9%, with two-thirds of its gains coming in the last half-hour of trading. The S&P 500 rallied 0.8%, and the Dow industrials picked up 0.7%. Small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 up just 0.6%. The IBD 50 rose 0.4%.


It wasn't surprising to see lower volume. Options and futures expired Friday, resulting in heavy volume and a tough comparison. Still, volume was below average.


Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by about 2 to 1. Winners topped losers on the Nasdaq by 8 to 5.


To say it's a frustrating environment for growth investors is perhaps the understatement of the year. Charts that look like they could yield solid breakouts have usually fizzled. **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) soared out of a base Friday, but it closed near its low and below an 83.10 buy point in huge volume. It extended losses Monday.


**Imax** ([IMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMAX)) showed similar action last week when it tried to clear a 39.97 buy point. It closed with a whimper, just like Red Hat. Imax triggered the 8% sell rule Monday.

Translation? Institutional investors were not the fuel behind the buying.


Whipsaw, back-and-forth action isn't anything new for the stock market. It's been that way for a while, and it hasn't made things easy for growth investors. It's also typical action when institutional investors are hesitant to put new money to work.


In this type of environment, it doesn't make sense having aggressive exposure to stocks. It's OK to keep tabs on high-quality, base-building names like **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), for example, but whether their bases will be able to yield sustained breakouts is a big question mark.


In LinkedIn's case, the correction in the handle is 13%. The handle is now forming below the 50-day moving average. Both are negatives. Facebook looks better. It's still holding above its 50-day moving average.


Apple supplier **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is also in a good technical setup. Shares rose 4% Monday after RBC Capital Markets upgraded it to top pick from outperform. But Avago's bullish chart is in conflict with lukewarm fundamentals. Earnings and sales growth have been decelerating in recent quarters, with single-digit growth expected in fiscal 2016 and 2017.

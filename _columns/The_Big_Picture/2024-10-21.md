  Stock Market Ends Mixed As Small Caps Disappoint The Hopeful; Expect This To Jump During Earnings

The stock market started a new week on mixed footing Monday. While technology stocks made a bid to extend a six-week winning streak, small caps did a face plant.




The Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.3% on Monday. Not far behind, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund ended the day up nearly 0.2%. The fund tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq.


Yet most of the other popular indexes could not end in the winners column.


The worst performer? Small caps, as the Russell 2000 lost almost 1.6%. The S&P MidCap 400 sank 1.2%, significantly more than losses of 0.8% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a slightly less than 0.2% slip by the S&P 500.


Even the S&P SmallCap 600 — which most investing pros would agree has a more fundamentally sound collection of companies vs. the Russell 2000 in terms of earnings, profit margins and sales — had a rough Monday at the office. Its 1.7% decline wiped out gains made since Oct. 12. The drop also marked the 600's worst in a single session since a 1.7% slide on Sept. 6.


Spirited Stock Market Turnover
------------------------------


Volume surged nearly 20% on the Nasdaq vs. Friday's trading to 6.09 billion shares and edged 1% higher on the New York Stock Exchange to 3.41 billion.


The S&P 500 technically avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). While volume grew, the large-cap index's loss fell short of the 0.2% minimum.


A sharp rise in interest rates perhaps had a lot to do with Monday's motley picture.


Stock Market: Small Caps Down As Yields Go Up
---------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102124.jpg)The yield on the key U.S. 10-year government bond climbed 10 basis points to 4.18%. That marked the highest close since July 26, according to Cboe Global Markets data.


Perhaps the stock market is getting a stronger sense that the Federal Reserve is going to continue cutting interest rates to ensure an economic soft landing, but just not as aggressively as investors thought after the central bank cut the fed funds rate in September by half a point to a target range of 4.75%-5%.


That was the Fed's first outright move to ease monetary policy since the spring of 2020.


Go to a [MarketSurge daily chart](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and type in "0TNX" (0 as in zero), and you'll see the 10-year bond yield is now pressing against upside resistance at the 200-day moving average.


Yields rise as bond prices go lower. The yield, or return, goes up as traders who seek to exit their positions sell to make bonds more attractive for would-be buyers.


Watch The Cost Of Money
-----------------------


It's common to see the Russell 2000, a bastion of smaller companies, sell off as the cost of money rises. A jump in interest rates, particularly on the long end of the yield curve, generally places pressure on economically sensitive firms.


Think homebuilding, regional banks and cyclical companies. In fact, looking at the 20 worst performers among [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the stock market on Monday, and many of them hailed from these sectors.



According to early data, mobile building manufacturing, residential building, Southwest and Western banks, mortgage services, construction products, meat, apparel maker and discount retail stocks led the downside, each falling 2% or more on a price-related basis.


On the upside? The heavy construction group had a great Monday. **Construction Partners** ([ROAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROAD)) boomed to an all-time high of 86 and closed the session up 13% in the heaviest turnover since March 25.


The daily chart shows a long chain of inter-connected bases. Buying on breakouts from most of them proved perilous.



No doubt, the breakouts that occurred on May 22, July 22-23 and Sept. 16 led to the trigger of [IBD's golden rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). That is, the position had to get jettisoned because ROAD fell 7% or more below each buy point. The Sept. 16 run past 66.50 was an exception.


Nonetheless, the year-to-date move has been impressive. After the provider of construction products and services broke out of a symmetrical base at 45.22 on Jan. 31, ROAD has rallied 90%. It's grown to midcap status with a market value of $4.5 billion and 53 million shares outstanding.


Construction Partners' earnings have leapt 136%, 375%, 82% and 44% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters through the second quarter of the calendar year. (The company's fiscal year ends in September.) These four quarters total $1.35 in earnings per share. Yet itt's worth noting that in Q1, the firm actually posted a 2-cent net loss, far smaller than the 11 cents it lost in the year-ago quarter. So, how does IBD calculate an "82% EPS increase?"


In order to turn the 11 cent-per-share loss to an 11 cent gain, one must add 22 cents. Add the same amount to the 2-cent loss to get a theoretical profit of 20 cents. A "profit" of 20 cents vs. 11 cents translates to 82% growth.


Triggering A Profit-Taking Rule
-------------------------------


Last week, **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) reversed negatively. A gain of as much as 6.3% turned into a 3.6% decline for the week. On Monday, the member of IBD's Banks-West/Southwest industry group got thumped again. The stock dropped nearly 5.9% and [sharply undercut its 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


Monday's action arguably justified a decision to take short-term profits.



Notice on a weekly chart how Western Alliance has not closed below its 10-week line even a single time since it throttled out of a long consolidation with a 65.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the week ended July 12. From that entry, WAL propelled more than 25%. (The daily chart, according to [MarketSurge chart pattern recognition](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), also showed an eight-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/netflix-stock-chart-pattern/) that showed a 64.74 entry.)


[Taking gains in many stocks at 20%-25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/), or perhaps a little more than that, can prove very beneficial to a portfolio's long-term equity curve.


On Thursday last week, after the market close, Western Alliance reported a 9% decline in third-quarter earnings to $1.80 a share on a 15% revenue increase to $823.1 million.


Market Internals: Vigilant On Divergence
----------------------------------------


Going back to the broader stock market, breadth turned out highly negative on the stock market. On the New York Stock Exchange, early data showed decliners surpassing risers by nearly 4-to-1, though it was much worse earlier in the day. Nasdaq losers beat winners on Monday by roughly 9-to-4.


See the exact figures on the GMI (General Market Indicators) PDF at the bottom of every Big Picture column.


Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) fell 0.6% on Monday for its fourth drop in five sessions. The exchange traded fund's performance differed sharply from the Nasdaq 100, being a market-cap-weighted index. Yet QQQE remains bullishly on the north side of the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


In contrast to the S&P 500's small loss of less than 0.2% on Monday, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fund also fared poorly on Monday, losing nearly 0.9%.


Gains are thin for RSP in the fourth quarter so far. It pole-vaulted 9% higher in the July-to-September period.


Over the next two weeks in the stock market, the majority of S&P 500 companies report quarterly results. Stocks often rise in expectation of rosy earnings and sales, and often sell right on the news.


This phenomenon is hardly new. "Buy the rumor, sell the news" is extremely common behavior. Therefore, be extra careful about ponying up large amounts of cash to buy key stock market leaders right before their announcements.

A Great Earnings Lesson In The Stock Market
-------------------------------------------


**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) is a wonderful example of why it's often better to wait for earnings to come out and the post-reaction dust to settle before considering a tactical entry.



On Oct. 11, 2023, the megacap social media play broke out of a 10-week base featuring a decline of just 16% from high to low. Its breakout past 326.20 lasted all but a day. It soon fell more than 8% below that buy point, forcing new buyers to cut losses. The downdraft occurred just as the Facebook and Instagram operator reported quarterly results.


Yet the stock snapped back bullishly. In both November and December that year, Meta rebounded and took out that 326.20 former entry without forming a full-fledged base.


Since then, Meta has sharply outperformed. It's gained as much as 85% from the 326.20 original entry to a new high of 602.95. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has advanced a healthy 40% since the end of October 2023.


Meta is currently a full-size position in the [Leaderboard model stock portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Leaderboard, on a portfolio-weighted basis, gained more than 30% through the fiscal year ended June 30.


Beyond Meta
-----------


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-meta-platforms-meta.aspx), Meta tops the Internet-Content industry group in terms of Composite Rating (96). Keep an eye on other leaders in the group, including **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)), Norway-based **Opera** ([OPRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPRA)) (thinly traded with an average dollar volume of $7 million), and new issue **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)).

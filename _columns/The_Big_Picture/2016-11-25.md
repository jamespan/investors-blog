U.S. stock indexes finished high in the day's range Friday, notching fresh record highs.


The Nasdaq added 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow rose 0.4% each. Volume was down in the holiday-shortened session. Trading ended at 1 p.m. ET, three hours earlier than usual.


Stocks will be back to a full session of trade Monday, but funds might still have a reason to step carefully. Before Tuesday's open, the second reading on third-quarter GDP will be released.

The economy has basically been in a growth recession for years now, and the market will be looking to see if growth can pick up.


President-elect Donald Trump appears to have created some bullish sentiment, at least among small caps and select sectors. Since Election Day, the small-cap S&P 600 is up 14%. The money center banking group is up 11%. The cement group is up 13%.


How far can the Trump rally go? The three Nasdaq rallies of 2016 led to gains of 18% (February-April); 6% (May-early June); and 17% (June-September). The pullbacks in between those rallies were in the 6%-to-8% range.


So far, the current uptrend has risen about 7%. If the market echoes the shorter rally, then a pullback is near. Otherwise, this move could have more room to run.


How should the individual investor play this situation?


By now, most IBD-style investors have taken positions in stocks and sectors that are showing strength. The challenge is portfolio management. Because decisions for both profit-taking and loss-cutting are based on chart action, this simplifies the job.


The stock's price and volume action will guide the decision to hold, add more, or sell. Don't get into an argument with the chart.

Breakouts were scarce Friday, but an indirect play on cement broke out.


**Insteel Industries** ([IIIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIIN)) [broke out](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) of a clumsy-looking cup base, rising 16%. Volume was 544% above average.
Insteel grew earnings 37%, 28% and 79% in the past three fiscal years ended in September. The company makes steel wire reinforcement products for the concrete construction industry. At Monday's close, Insteel will join the S&P 600.


**Coming up**: The Dallas Fed manufacturing survey for November will be released 10:30 ET Monday. About 100 manufacturers participate in the survey. Also before Tuesday's open, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will report third-quarter data on corporate profits.

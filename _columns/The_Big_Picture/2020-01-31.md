Bearish Signals In S&P 500, Nasdaq Add Up To Weaker Outlook Amid Coronavirus Worry
===================================================================================

Indexes continued to sell off as the deadly coronavirus caused more economic disruptions, resulting in the first downgrade in the outlook for U.S. stocks since late September.




The S&P 500 slid 1.8% on Friday and undercut its prior low from last Monday. The index is now testing its 50-day moving average for the first time since October.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1% and closed below its 50-day line for the first time since Oct. 9. The index bounced off the 50-day line last Monday, but found no such support Friday.


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.6%. The Dow and S&P 500 have now wiped away the modest increases they had for the new year. The Nasdaq has a 2% gain left.

For the composite, some longer-term challenges are surfacing. The index had already showed some overheating after climbing above an upper channel line, and now it is dipping below a trend line over multimonth lows. The S&P 500 also is below a lower trend line.


Small caps are hurting more. The Russell 2000 tumbled 2.1% Friday and fell sharply below the 50-day average.


Distribution, Other Bearish Signals
-----------------------------------


Volume rose, resulting in [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. With multiple distribution days and a market slump worsening, IBD changed its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure."


Investors must now raise their shields. Specifically, take some profits and avoid [margin](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-margin-trading/). New stock buys should be reserved for exceptional cases.


Also, sell any stock that [falls more than 7% or 8% below the purchase price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). It hasn't been a deluge, but several leading stocks are hitting that sell signal. **Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) fell as much as 11% from its 90.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock was removed from [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Friday. **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) also has fallen sharply below its buy point.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) closed the week well below its 10-week moving average in heavy volume. That's another type of [sell signal based on a clear break of support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **AudioCodes** ([AUDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AUDC)) show similar decay.


The coronavirus continued to spread unchecked, and global markets contracted as more companies limited travel or took other steps to prevent infections.


Stocks in China, the epicenter of the outbreak, were particularly hit hard. IShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) tumbled 1.9% and fell deeper below the 50-day line.

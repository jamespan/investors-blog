  Quiet Session Sees Record Closing Highs For Dow, Nasdaq, S&P 500

The stock market didn't move much Wednesday, but it wasn't a bad performance by any means as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite marked record closing highs for the second straight session.




The Dow and Russell 2000 led the way, rising 0.2%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. The Aug. 8 distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the count because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant.


The market went back into a confirmed uptrend on Aug. 22 when the Nasdaq gapped up and rose 1.4% in higher volume. It ended up being the right call as the Nasdaq has rallied about 2.6% since then. There's been only one distribution day since that day's sign of strength.


A reminder that amid plenty of worries of a market pullback, the overall market landscape still looks OK. Leading stocks are holding up fine, while signs of meaningful distribution just aren't there.

Sentiment data shouldn't be used alone when gauging market health, especially since bulls have plenty to hang their hats on, including tame inflation and the likelihood that interest rates will likely stay low for the foreseeable future. Among other things, that's a good environment for corporate earnings and continued M&A activity. It's not that long before companies close their books on the third quarter and earnings reports start rolling in again in October.


But it's still a challenging environment for breakouts, as evidenced by **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) price action. The personal technology bellwether hasn't made much progress after a breakout Aug. 2 over a 156.75 buy point. It's still holding above the buy point, but the stock's action was bearish Tuesday, when shares reversed lower in heavy volume. It ended up being a classic case of "sell the news" after Apple revealed [a new lineup of iPhones](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/att-to-strike-first-blow-with-iphone-8-buy-one-get-one-free-offer/) and some upgrades to Apple Watch. Apple ended near its session high Wednesday but still lost nearly 0.8%. It's lost ground in six of the past seven trading sessions.


Speaking of breakouts, **Trex Co.** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) was a heavy-volume gainer Wednesday, rising 2% to 81.63. Trex cleared an 82.14 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) buy point early but ended below it. The maker of wood-alternative decking, railing and fencing products for residential and commercial markets is expected to see high demand as a result of Hurricane Irma.


In the semiconductor space, **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and **Integrated Device Technology** ([IDTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDTI)) cleared buy points, but it was Xilinx that looked the best by the close. Shares of Xilinx rose 3% to 66.97. The stock ended near its session high and still in buy range from a 66.58 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point. Integrated Device Technology, meanwhile, jumped over a 27.19 buy point early in the session but faded. Shares rose nearly 3% to 26.99.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), meanwhile, cleared a rare ascending base with a 177.10 buy point. Shares gained 2% to 178.97. Volume rose from Tuesday and was about 25% above average — not bad these days, when volume has generally has been quiet.


On the downside, **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) crashed 8.5% to 43.67 — fallout from the **Equifax** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)) security breach. Shareholders who bought when TransUnion gapped up over a 35.89 buy point in mid-February got an unequivocal sell signal Wednesday.



After a recent breakout, SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ended the day lower for the third time in four session. Shares eased around 0.8% to 125.61. It's still holding comfortably above a 123.41 buy point.


Benchmark crude oil, meanwhile, picked up $1.07, or 2.2%, to settle at $49.30 a barrel after the International Energy Agency said oil stockpiles in developed countries could hit or fall below their five-year average "very soon."


Several of the day's top-performing industry groups hailed from the oil and gas sector, although actionable names are tough to find as most remain far off 52-week highs.

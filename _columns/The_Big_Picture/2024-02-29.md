  Stocks Climb As Nasdaq Finally Hits Record Closing High; Chip Leader AMD Breaks Out

The stock market finished higher Thursday, as Wall Street reacted positively to a key inflation report, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to record closes.




Meanwhile, stock market leaders **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)), **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)) and **TechnipFMC** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)) are in or near buy zones on the stock market today.


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, the [primary Federal Reserve inflation rate](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-federal-reserve-inflation-rate-bad-news-for-rate-cuts-sp-500-rise/), the core PCE price index, rose 0.4% in January, matching forecasts. The core 12-month inflation rate eased to 2.8% vs. 2.9% in December, also in line with Wall Street expectations.


The personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index rose 0.3% in January, in line with forecasts. The 12-month headline inflation rate eased to 2.4%, matching estimates.


After the January PCE report, market pricing showed only [21% odds](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) that the first rate cut will come by the May 1 meeting. Odds of a Fed rate cut by June 12 now stand at 66%, up from 57% ahead of the data.


Markets are now pricing in a year-end 2024 Fed funds rate of 4.5% vs. the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%. That implies three quarter-point rate cuts this year are more likely than four cuts.


In response, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.25%, closing at its lowest level since Feb. 15.

Stock Market Today Rallies Late
-------------------------------


Indexes picked up steam in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 0.9%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.7%.


For the Nasdaq, it was the first record closing high since Nov. 19, 2021. That span of 569 sessions was the longest since the 3,801 trading days from March 2000 to April 2015, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


![Market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP022924-221x300.jpg)The S&P 500's [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) on Jan. 24 dropped off the distribution-day count because 25 sessions have now passed.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. It was the largest volume this year on the NYSE.


In the Dow Jones industrials, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) were among the biggest advancers, with gains of 3% and 2.5%, respectively. Salesforce hit a new high, while Intel shares continue to struggle below the 50-day line.


On the Dow Jones' downside, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) paced the decliners. Boeing dropped 1.6%, back near its recent lows. Goldman shares lost more than 1%, but still held above the 50-day line.


And top growth stocks climbed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose nearly 1.3% to bounce back from Wednesday's 1.6% loss. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [energy drink leader](https://www.investors.com/news/celsius-swings-to-profit-breaks-out-monster-beverage-rallies/) **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) surged past a 68.94 buy point, with a 20% earnings-fueled advance.

What To Do Now
--------------


After Thursday's gains, the major stock indexes are back at their highs, and IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%. The overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend."


While the stock market rally continues to show strength, there still aren't very many actionable ideas. That's because most of the best stocks have already broken out and are not near follow-on buy areas. For example, [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list showed one stock Thursday: **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)). Shares topped a 91.58 cup-with-handle entry in unimpressive volume.


The best opportunities will likely be rebounds from the 10-week line after breakout moves in recent months. A prolonged respite in the major stock indexes would lead to new base formations among leading stocks.


Keep track of emerging bases with the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks in bases that are near buy points. For example, **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) has a 73.53 flat-base entry.

Stock Market Leaders: AMD, Duolingo, Embraer
--------------------------------------------



Meanwhile, market leaders Advanced Micro Devices, Duolingo, Embraer and TechnipFMC are in or near buy zones Thursday.


Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amd-ibd-stock-of-the-day-ramps-up-ai-chip-production/), Advanced Micro Devices is breaking out past a flat base's 184.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) after a 9.1% rally Thursday. The 5% buy zone tops out at 194.17.


Duolingo soared more than 22% Thursday, bullishly retaking its 50-day line and moving sharply up the right side of a new base. That base has a 245.87 entry, though an early entry can be seen at 240.78, Thursday's high price.


[Embraer](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/embraer-ibd-stock-of-the-day-wings-toward-a-buy-point-flashes-bullish-signal/) is moving up the right side of a cup base that has a 20.13 buy point. Investors could have used Tuesday's advance above an early entry at 18.85.


[Oil field services provider](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/technipfmc-stock-could-see-160-eps-growth-in-2024/) TechnipFMC is building a cup base that has a 22.78 buy point. Shares closed Thursday about 5% away from their buy point.

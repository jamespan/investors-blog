title: Stock Market Sells Off On Hot Inflation Report As 10-Year Treasury Yield Tops 2%

The stock market sold off Thursday in a volatile session as Treasury yields spiked after a hotter-than-expected inflation report, tapping the brakes on Wednesday's bullish market action.




Early Thursday, [the consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-hotter-than-expected-in-january-dow-jones-falls-bond-yields-rise/) came in hotter than expected in January, as both the consumer price index inflation rate and the core rate, which excludes food and energy, hit new 39-year highs. The CPI rose 0.6% from the prior month and 7.5% vs. a year ago, the biggest annual gain since February 1982, the Labor Department said.


The 10-year Treasury yield surged above 2% Thursday for the [first time since mid-2019](https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-yields-climb-after-inflation-data-release-11644502206), closing at 2.03%. Treasury yields continue to climb on expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates to combat pervasively high inflation.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market opened sharply lower Thursday following the CPI report. But indexes quickly slashed losses and the Nasdaq even turned slightly higher in midday trade. But that action proved to be short-lived as the major stock indexes headed south in afternoon trade, closing near session lows.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP021022-199x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.5% Thursday, while the S&P 500 moved down 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 2.1%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 descended nearly 1.6%. In a wild day, indexes opened with sharp losses, trimmed most by midday, but then selling resumed in the afternoon.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Top growth stocks were also hit hard, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 2.1%. The ETF of top growth stocks snapped a three-day winning streak.

The Nasdaq added its second [distribution day,](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) while the S&P 500 saw its first day of institutional selling since the Jan. 31 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


The stock market remains in an uptrend, but Thursday's sharp losses are a cause for concern, especially in the wake of Wednesday's big gains in higher volume, which acted as a secondary follow-through. Investors still have the option to buy new breakouts but need to proceed with caution. A lingering problem is the lack of breakouts among technology leaders, while most breakouts have been in cyclical and financial sectors.



Stocks To Watch: BHP, Blackstone, Palo Alto, Stifel
---------------------------------------------------


**BHP** **Group** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)), **Blackstone** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Stifel Financial** ([SF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SF)) are among the stocks to watch in the volatile stock market uptrend.


Mining giant BHP Group broke out above a [cup-with-handle entry](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=60468479a91298310bc13f6410aeb31e56ed99b0f764468be26d83d1f473d98c5ba53cf75704a23582b73ec1acb138ce8245c172e72dcb367b8206c2e64da77e) on Thursday, moving past a 69.66 buy point and closing in on the 5% [buy zone](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=60468479a9129831d0cc38fe301b09afb00e0c0aab682ce3797e3728fa03897291c3aa7a110f6b8609d035f86fa0dd1f93b71903773240b9ce2a050a42dab38f), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The [relative strength line](https://click.email.investors.com/?qs=60468479a912983152095d19fbe4037c07b1b2ae2e5848cbff2ddd15cd84722d79fecfe4612f6c517e1f4e162fbbde5aecba6e1eff143441ea1915e5e08f7516) hit a recent high but remains far from its old highs, so that's a technical metric to watch.


[IBD SwingTrader stock](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Blackstone is again approaching a [double-bottom base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) 136.56 buy point, and the stock is about 1% away from the entry following Thursday's slight loss. [BX stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-blackstone-inc-bx.aspx) shows a strong 95 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) per [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)

[Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/panw-stock-shapes-up-ahead-of-earnings-on-feb-22/), Palo Alto Networks, is moving up the right side of a cup base with a 572.77 buy point. Keep an eye out for a potential handle to offer a lower entry. The cybersecurity leader will report earnings on Feb. 22, so an early breakout move will carry more risk.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Stifel Financial remains above a 78.70 buy point despite Thursday's 0.9% loss and second straight decline. Its RS line hit a new high this week.

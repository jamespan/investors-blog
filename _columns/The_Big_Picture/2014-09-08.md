Stocks kicked off the first full week of September with a split decision Monday. 

  

Hurt by broad weakness in oil stocks, the S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The energy sector has a 10% weighting in the benchmark index. Half of the day's 10 worst-performing industry groups were oil related. Crude oil for October delivery dropped 63 cents to $92.66 a barrel, the third straight loss.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.2% in a seesaw session. Intraday, the tech-heavy index rose as much as 0.4% and fell as much as 0.3%. Software, solar and biotech stocks were pockets of strength.

  

Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 edged up 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.1%. The IBD 50 rose 0.3%, outperforming the major averages.

  

Decliners beat advancers by nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE. But winners topped losers 5-to-3 on the Nasdaq. Volume picked up from Friday's pace on the Nasdaq. But turnover slipped on the NYSE, helping the S&P 500 to dodge a distribution day, a bout of institutional selling.

  

Last week, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 stretched their winning ways to five straight weeks. The S&P 500 is in the longest win streak since running for eight straight weeks from October through November.

  

Some digestion can be expected in the current market. In recent sessions, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have developed some stickiness around the round numbers 4600 and 2000, respectively.

  

On the plus side, the overall level of institutional selling remains mild in the current market uptrend. Few leaders have come under fire, while a couple of new issues are on fire.

  

**GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) and **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) both ramped to new highs for the second straight session Monday. Both have surged more than 20% from their respective buy points, triggering IBD's eight-week hold rule for handling fast movers.

  

Unless sell signals appear, investors should hold for at least eight weeks. This rule is designed to help investors avoid selling prematurely a stock showing exceptional strength.

  

Other leaders such as **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) have stuck to tight ranges after gap-ups in July. While both have not triggered sell signals, investors don't have to wait around. Capital is a scarce resource. If a trade is not working out or stalls, investors may look to put money to work in other trading opportunities.

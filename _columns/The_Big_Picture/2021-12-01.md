One day after a [downgrade to the current outlook for the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dives-as-powell-comments-omicron-variant-stoke-fears/), an early rebound hit the skids after the new Covid strain omicron was found in the U.S. Wednesday. With the current picture around the new variant unclear, and other worries weighing, it was no surprise gains evaporated. Growth stocks in particular fared poorly.




The Nasdaq raced out of the blocks, but gains melted away as the session wore on. It ended on a sour note, hitting lows of the day as it dipped 1.8%. But volume was lower for the day, which means the composite index did not add another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Nevertheless, the Nasdaq has now slipped just below its 50-day moving average. If the market is to avoid going into a correction, it is important to see the premier index for growth stocks rally from here.


The S&P 500 also got off to a good start before reversing lower. It closed the day down 1.2% as NYSE turnover fell sharply.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP120121_3--251x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 1.3%. It slalomed lower into the close and broke below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/). Ditto for the NYSE composite.


Small caps suffered once again, with the Russell 2000 reversing lower as it dropped 2.3%. But bears saved the harshest spanking for growth stock investors, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 3.8% and taking out its long-term 200-day line as well.


A key gauge to watch at the moment is the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). The VIX spiked more than 17% Wednesday. At 31.94, that marked the highest close in more than 10 months. (You can also view [the VIX on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by punching in "zero-VIX.")


Omicron Hits U.S. Stock Market; Covid Worries Grow
--------------------------------------------------


Investors were spooked after the first U.S. case of the omicron variant was found in California. A patient was discovered to have contracted the strain after returning from South Africa last week. It's a concern that  the traveler had been fully vaccinated. However, symptoms were reportedly mild.


But Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya pointed out there were other factors at play as well as the U.S. detected its first case of omicron.


"Equities pared gains after South Africa Covid cases nearly doubled since Tuesday and after (South African) infectious disease official Richard Lessells noted it is too early to say omicron only causes mild cases," he said in a note to clients. "The next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading."


The ADP private payroll report showed 534,000 jobs were created in November, which beat analyst estimates of 525,000. Leisure and hospitality jobs were more than 30% of the positions added to the service sector, which could be hit by omicron.



With Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterating his recently more hawkish tone on his second day speaking to Congress, it is certainly a time for investors to be keeping their powder dry in terms of opening new positions for the moment.


Covid vaccine plays retreated on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) plunged about 12% in volume that jumped 63% above its 50-day average. **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) slipped nearly 5%. BNTX's partner **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) fared better though, gaining almost 2%.


Salesforce.com Earnings Hit These Software Stocks
-------------------------------------------------


Mixed guidance from **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) saw the enterprise software giant dive; plus earnings for the October-ended quarter fell 27%, breaking a five-quarter streak of year-over-year gains.



"In a market where anything but clean 'beat and raises' are punished, we are not surprised to see CRM shares under some pressure," Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne said.


The Dow Jones stock ended up flashing [multiple sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) as it closed the day down almost 12%. It plunged below its 50-day line and also fell more than 7% below a 275.32 buy point. That action also [triggered the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


The software giant's results weighed on other stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group.


**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) closed down 4.1% and fell below its 50-day line in heavy turnover. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) slumped 7.4% in the heaviest turnover for a down session for the company since April. And **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) dived 11.7%.


The pressure was also brought to bear on **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) ahead of its earnings report. The Warren Buffett stock [was removed from Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) after it round-tripped all of its gains and more from a 328.16 breakout point in a [deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/).


These Industry Groups Fare Best
-------------------------------


Even during these trying days in the stock market, however, it's vital to look for pockets of strength. And on Wednesday, a number of groups stood out from the crowd.


Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless, Retail-Department Stores and Auto Manufacturers were the top industry groups of the day, though all gave up ground. See the daily performance of all 197 industries tracked by IBD at [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


**NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) was one of the fop performers in the fabless semiconductors group. It closed down slightly, but only after moving above a 227.50 [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) earlier in the session. This could be a stock to watch, with both earnings and market performance impressive since the stock market bottomed in March 2020.


The IBD Computer-Integrated Systems, Retail/Wholesale-Office Supplies and Medical-Long Term Care groups were the worst performing industry groups.

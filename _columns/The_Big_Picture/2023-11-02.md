The stock market extended Wednesday's bullish action, as the major stock indexes logged more powerful gains Thursday. Next up, Wall Street is bracing for Friday's October jobs report. Meanwhile, Apple stock fell on earnings in extended trade.




The Labor Department's employment report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Wall Street projects the U.S. economy added 179,000 jobs in October, down from September's 336,000 increase. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.8%.


Late Thursday, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) declined about 1% after the iPhone maker's [earnings topped views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-drops-as-sales-fall-for-fourth-straight-quarter/) while revenue declined but also topped estimates. AAPL stock finished Thursday back above its 50-day moving average after a five-day win streak.


Stock market leaders **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Uber Technologies** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) are stocks to watch in the new stock market uptrend.


Jobless Claims, Earnings Reports
--------------------------------


The U.S. Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims rose to 217,000 vs. 210,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 213,000.


**![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP110623-240x300.jpg)Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) soared 20% after [the company reported Thursday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-earnings-q32023/) that adjusted third-quarter earnings came in at 7 cents a share. That was a penny ahead of estimates and up from 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. Revenue of $558 million also was ahead of views for $556 million.


Also on the earnings front, movers included **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)), **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)). They were joined by **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)).


[ABNB stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/airbnb-abnb-stock-q3-earnings-2023/) sold off 3.2% Thursday, while CF stock reversed from early losses to gain 1.5%. [ELF shares](https://www.investors.com/news/elf-beauty-earnings-elf-beauty-stock-q2-2024/) slashed big gains to 3.65%, while [Etsy stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/etsy-stock-earnings-q3-2023/) moved up 1.6% and [SMCI stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/smci-stock-supermicro-beats-estimates-on-ai-infrastructure-demand/) sold off 2.6%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, indexes closed near their session highs, finishing sharply in the green.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.9%. The S&P had its best day since April 27, making its four-day streak the strongest since November 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its strong gain in higher volume marks a follow-through for the index, although the Nasdaq's follow-through Wednesday changed IBD's market outlook to "confirmed uptrend."


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced 1.8%. Its 5.6%, five-day advance is the best since late January and early February. And the small-cap Russell 2000 led the way with a 2.7% jump.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That indicates broad participation by institutional investors. Moreover, gains were broad. Advancers led decliners by 3-1 on the Nasdaq and by [better than 7-1 on the NYSE](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us?mod=market-data-center).


In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, retail giant **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) jumped 4.1%, closing at its highest level since Oct. 24. Shares remain around 20% off their 52-week high. On the downside, **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) was sole Dow loser, falling just 0.2% Thursday.


A jump in Treasury yields had been a drag on stocks, but that trend is reversing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 12 basis points to 4.66% Thursday, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 13.


But top growth stocks struggled despite the market rise, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 0.1%, ending a three-day win streak. Much of the IBD 50's lag was due to **Remitly Global** ([RELY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RELY)), which plummeted nearly 32% after its earnings report.


Also in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Ferrari** ([RACE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RACE)) raced 6% higher. Shares are forming a flat base with a 329.88 buy point, although the stock cleared a trend line entry around 317. **Dorian LPG** ([LPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPG)) also led the IBD 50, jumping 11.6% to new highs after the earnings report.


What To Do Now: Raise Market Exposure
-------------------------------------


Following Wednesday's bullish follow-through day, investors should be raising their market exposure. IBD recommends a level of 20% to 40% until the trend strengthens further. One factor in that decision is how the market reacts to Apple's earnings and the jobs report.


Don't just plunge into the market. While no market uptrend has ever begun without one, [not every follow-through succeeds](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). So raise your exposure gradually as more and more breakouts emerge.


A great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks that are breaking out past new buy points. Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows stocks nearing buy points in bases.

Bears kept the stock market on a short leash Friday, yanking the bulls every time it looked like they might run ahead.




The Nasdaq ended down 0.5% after being up 1.3% in the first half-hour of trade.


Small caps did far worse, losing 1% for the day on the S&P 600. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%, while the large-cap S&P 500 was just under flat.


During the week, leadership fluctuated within a peculiar mix of stocks and funds.

The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 4% Tuesday to own the day.


Invesco KBW Bank Fund ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)) popped 0.9% to lead the indexes Wednesday.


The Dow Jones utility average led with a thin 0.2% advance Thursday.


On Friday, the Dow utility average again led but moved with more conviction. The index gained 1.6%.


With the exception of the aggressive Innovator IBD 50 Fund on Tuesday, there wasn't much for the bulls to cheer about. And the Innovator IBD 50 was lower for the week.


Still, that could be about to change in the bulls' favor. Three factors are tilting toward the bulls.


3 Ways Bulls Could Win
----------------------


* First, the put/call volume ratio closed at 1.24 Thursday, a level that suggests a market bottom either has been made or is near. The secondary indicator flashed similar readings in late March and early April, around the time the market began a rally.
* Second, October has a bad reputation it probably doesn't deserve, thanks to those who focus on monthly historical price performance. IBD investors are more interested in follow-through days, which signal that a new uptrend has begun. Only March and August can compete with October's performance for successful follow-through days, according to an IBD study going back to 2000.
* Third, algorithm and computerized trade could be a chief reason the market is currently in correction mode. But when things go too far south, bulls can expect an algorithm-inspired move the other way.


Algorithm trading drives 60% to 90% of daily volume, according to various estimates.


One thing that could mess this up is if the economy is headed for a recession. An economic recession is the force behind most prolonged bear markets.

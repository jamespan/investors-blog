The stock market got through new economic data, earnings reports and a public appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell with ease Wednesday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed for a fourth consecutive day.


Both major indexes rose to record highs again Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 45,000 for the first time.


The Nasdaq led with a 1.3% jump, making it 11 gains in the past 12 sessions. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, also its 11th gain in the past 12 sessions. The technology sector outperformed, giving the Nasdaq plenty of tailwind.




The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rose 1.8% to an all-time high, clearing an alternative [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) at 237.94. The exchange traded fund initially broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) Sept. 26 and is up 6% from a 227.37 buy point.


A series of positive earnings reports made the tech sector a winner. Chipmaker **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) beat expectations on [strong demand for its custom chips](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/marvell-stock-marvel-earnings-custom-ai-chips-q32024/) for artificial intelligence applications. **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) soared 22% to its highest close since July after a [solid earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pure-storage-stock-earnings-q3-2024-ai/).


Software stocks in particular were brilliant. Seven of the 12 best-performing industry groups Wednesday were in that sector.


Dow Races To New Milestone
--------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP120424.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% and made one of its fastest runs to a 1,000-point milestone. The index took only 16 trading days to get from 44,000 to 45,000. That's the third-fastest 1,000-point jaunt on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) showed up big time for the Dow. The stock gapped up to a record high in heavy volume and provided the Dow with 224 of its 308-point advance. Late Tuesday, the software company issued a [mixed October-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-news-q32024/) but analysts cheered the company's progress in — what else — artificial intelligence products.


The Russell 2000 added 0.4% as it tried to snap out of a weeklong slumber. The small-cap benchmark briefly made a record high last week but has been slipping since.


Volume fell moderately on the New York Stock Exchange and rose on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq's solid gain in higher volume could be viewed as a secondary [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), a shot of confidence for the stock market.


Advancing stocks topped decliners by a 9-to-7 ratio on the Nasdaq. But winners and losers were nearly even on the NYSE.


Stock Market Overheating?
-------------------------


With few distribution days on the ledger, and indexes making record highs, the stock market gives investors justification to continue with 80% to 100% exposure, as IBD is recommending.


But could the major indexes be getting overheated? The signals are mixed.


The S&P 500 is 3.9% above the 50-day moving average, and the Nasdaq is nearly 6% above its 50-day line. That's the widest gap since the indexes made short-term highs in mid-November.


That's getting stretched, but is not necessarily cause for alarm. While above their 50-day lines, SPDR S&P 500 Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) and Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) are still below the percentages that historically signal stock market highs.


The Nasdaq's short-term overbought-oversold indicator in [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) has climbed to about 500. Spikes to that level signaled index pullbacks in early April, May, July and early September, but not in late September.

Investor optimism continues to run hot. The Investors Intelligence weekly survey of market newsletters showed bulls rose to 62.9% from 61.3% a week earlier. It's been eight straight weeks that bulls exceed 55%, which the firm considers a danger zone. It's also the most bulls since 64.2% in July.


While the stock market may need a little cooling, [seasonal trends are in its favor](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-tech-stocks/). December tends to be kind to stock investors, especially in the second half of the month.


Stock Market Watches Powell, Economic Data
------------------------------------------


At a New York Times DealBook conference Wednesday afternoon, Powell discussed a range of topics. He said nothing to disrupt the Fed's interest-rate outlook.


Powell says the U.S. economy is [doing better than it looked in September](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/december-fed-rate-cut-powell-be4a617f?mod=hp_lead_pos3), when the Fed started to cut interest rates. That gives the central bank more leeway in reducing rates while staying on track to move rates toward a more neutral level, he added.


Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said Powell's comments did nothing to alter the view that the Fed will likely trim rates on Dec. 18.


The Fed's Beige Book — released Wednesday afternoon — won't interfere with a rate cut, either, Guatieri added. It found economic activity growing slightly in most Fed districts, with the labor market steady.


"Although business contacts warned that 'tariffs pose a significant upside risk to inflation,' that's a worry for another day for the Fed," the economist noted. "It won't dissuade a quarter-point rate cut later this month, barring a surprisingly strong [payrolls report on Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-nov-bls-adp-federal-reserve-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/)."


The 10-year Treasury yield reversed lower by four basis points to 4.18%.

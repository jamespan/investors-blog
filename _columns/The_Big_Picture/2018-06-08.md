title: Stock Market Stays Calm Despite Trump-Induced G-7 Friction

U.S. stock indexes battled back from a weak start Friday as two news items kept the bulls on a short leash.




The Dow Jones industrial average, the large-cap S&P 500 and the small-cap S&P 600 each rose 0.3%. The Nasdaq trailed with a 0.1% gain.


Volume fell across the board.


The first news item was the start of the G-7 summit in Canada. The summit seemed to feed the stock market's caution, even though trade was not officially on the summit's agenda.

The second news item is the Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts expect a quarter-point rate hike. The Street will be focused on how many more increases are likely in the second half of 2018.


Two Realities
-------------


So far this year, the stock market seems to be reacting to two realities.


First, almost no one on Wall Street thinks about tariffs and trade policy as Trump does. For the most part, the tariff issue has capped the market's progress since late January. Still, this past week the Nasdaq climbed above the 7,500 level and crept above the 7,637 high briefly touched in mid-March.


Whether the Nasdaq can turn that area into support is worth watching.


Refusal To Sell Off
-------------------


Second, considering the heterodox economic notions Trump holds, the market's refusal to sell off aggressively is impressive.


It's as if the bulls are convinced that the strength of the rising U.S. economy and world economy can overcome whatever policy emerges from Washington.


IBD founder William J. O'Neil's book "How to Make Money in Stocks" offers words relevant to this news-driven market: "After it's been repeated several times, both good news and bad news become old news. Old news will often have the opposite effect on the stock market from what it had when the news first broke."


Trump and tariffs are old news, which could be good news.


At some point, investors can expect earnings and data to become the market's chief drivers.

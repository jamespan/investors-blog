Stocks Climb; This Pattern Makes The Nasdaq's Reversal Encouraging
===================================================================

The major stock indexes reversed higher Tuesday, leaving a good taste in investors' mouths but still not enough to satisfy the hunger for meaningful gains.




The Nasdaq composite erased a loss of nearly 1% to close 0.3% higher and above its 50-day moving average. That's considered bullish behavior, and it was even more positive because the Nasdaq's long price range engulfed the previous five days of price activity.


In other words, as investors took prices outside their accustomed path, buyers wrestled control away from sellers.


The S&P 500, which added 0.1%, did not quite top the Aug. 22 high but still made a bullish reversal of its own. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3% and again found support at its 50-day line. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

North Korea fired a long-range missile over Japan, escalating tensions with the West and neighboring countries.


Meantime, severe flooding in the Houston area was no better, and the region was bracing for even more flooding as Tropical Storm Harvey headed for landfall again in the Texas-Louisiana area.


Major indexes in Asia and Europe weren't so resilient. The Nikkei lost 0.5%; the London FTSE 100 fell 0.9% and the German DAX slid 1.5%.


At the open, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gapped down to the lowest since Aug. 21.


Early trading in New York saw a flight to safety, but it faded just as stock losses ebbed. The price of gold got as high as $1,326.08 an ounce, the highest since Nov. 9. But the 1.2% increase thinned out to 0.3% by about 2 p.m. ET, Bloomberg reported.  




A rush to Treasuries also faded. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 2.13% after dropping as low as 2.08%, its lowest in 10 months.


While Tuesday's market action painted a positive result, the longer-term picture remained mixed. A week ago, the Nasdaq punched its way back above the 50-day moving average and seemed ready to resume advancing. But the composite basically has gone nowhere.


The same for the S&P 500, which remains below resistance at its 50-day line and is 0.2% lower than a week ago.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq continue to trade in a pattern of lower lows and lower highs that's in place since the Aug. 8 peak.


Distribution days are still too high, with nine on the Nasdaq and six on the S&P. In contrast, index gains in higher volume have been sparse. The summer slog may be part of that, but it's certainly making it hard for top-rated stocks to make headway.


The transportation sector climbed, at least partly on continued weakness in oil prices. U.S. crude fell to $46.44 a barrel, hitting a five-week low. Trucking, ship, logistics and airfreight industry groups were among the top groups Tuesday. The Dow transportation average jumped 0.9%.


Consumer stocks were weakest. The footwear industry group lost 1.7% as **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) gapped down to a nearly 2% loss after sneaker retailer **Finish Line** ([FINL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FINL)) gave a dour outlook.


Restaurants, clothing chains, discount stores and leisure retailing fell more than 1%. Electronics retailers tumbled 6.6%, the worst performance, after **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) plunged 12% after its earnings report.


**Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)) broke out of flat base, soaring past the 38.83 buy point in 5-1/2 times more volume than average. Catalent, which makes drug delivery technologies, beat expectations with adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share and sales of $616.9 million, an increase of 16%. Shares surged 14% to a record high. It was the only notable breakout Tuesday.

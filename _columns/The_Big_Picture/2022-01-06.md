The stock market ended lower Thursday, while Treasury yields added to this week's sharp gains. The Nasdaq ended well off its morning lows even after gains faded in afternoon trade. Stock market leader **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) closed below a key support level, as its recent breakout attempt falters.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%, closing near session lows. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%, falling for a third straight day. The S&P 500 also lost 0.1%, as it searches for support at the 50-day moving average benchmark. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed, rising 0.6%, but remains below its 50-day line.


The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 1.73%, closing at its highest level since March 31 and just shy of 2021's intraday high above 1.76%.


Leading growth stocks finished with modest gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.3% after falling as much as 1.65% intraday. The ETF snapped a four-day losing streak, but remains sharply below its long-term 200-day moving average. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **ZIM Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) rose 2% Thursday, still below a cup with handle's 58.41 buy point.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


The tech-heavy Nasdaq extend a two-day losing streak with modest losses Thursday. The Nasdaq's intraday lows Thursday are close to where the index found support in early December and again in mid-December. Keep a watch to see if the index is once again able to find much-needed support. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is just above its 50-day line.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP010622-220x300.jpg)Amid Thursday's muted action, the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) remains in an "uptrend under pressure" following Wednesday's sell-off. The amount of institutional selling is unchanged from Wednesday; the S&P 500 carries three [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), while the Nasdaq has one.


During uptrends under pressure, even though the market uptrend is still intact, it's time to proceed with caution. Be disciplined and selective about new purchases — focus only on stocks with top-notch fundamental and technical metrics.


Don't entirely give up on the market rally yet. It's unclear if the Nasdaq can rebound from today's lows, which is where previous pullbacks have ended their descents. Or if this is a temporary pause in the selling and further weakness is imminent. Be flexible and let the market decide your best course of action.

-----------------------


Stock market leader and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Tesla skidded 2.15% Thursday, giving up its critical 50-day moving average line and triggering the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 1,119.10 trendline buy point.

If Tesla shares are able to decisively reclaim their 50-day line, then be on the lookout for a new buy point.

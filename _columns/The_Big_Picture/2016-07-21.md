Stock Indexes Lose Ground; eBay Shows Gap-Up Thrust

U.S. stocks stepped down Thursday, as the Nasdaq stumbled for the fourth time in eight sessions.


The Nasdaq lost 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each dropped 0.4%. The IBD 50 skidded 0.7%.


![MP072116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP072116.jpg)Volume rose on both major exchanges. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each suffered a distribution day, which indicates institutions were lightening their exposure.


The Nasdaq has played an alternating game of one day down followed by one day up, ever since the index closed above 5000 on July 12.


The good news: Up days have been stronger than the down days, and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq now appear to be moving more in line with each other. Not too long ago, the major indexes appeared to be operating in different universes.


The bad news: The market hasn't yet shown it is comfortable with big gains at the current altitude. A pullback would not be surprising now.


For the major indexes, this could be a critical juncture. Either the stock market finds the courage to knock out new highs on a regular basis, or it turns in its man card and reverts to the timid, uncertain action of the past 12 months.


Since July 21 of last year, the Nasdaq has lost 3% while the S&P 500 gained 2%. An index investor could've taken a year off only to find on his or her return neither significant pain nor significant gains.


Yet more than a handful of stocks showed gap-up strength Thursday after reportingÂ quarterly results.


Online marketplace operator **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) gapped up 11% in torrid volume.


Low-end homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) gapped up 4% in heavy volume. Another homebuilder, **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), gapped up 5% in soaring volume.


Construction and industrial equipment renter **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) gapped up 9% in heavy volume.


Chip supplier **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) gapped up 7% in heavy volume.


High-end medical stock **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) gapped up 8% in big volume.


Manager of rewards programs for retailers **Alliance Data Systems** ([ADS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADS)) gapped up 6% in hefty volume.


Theater sound systems maker **Imax** ([IMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMAX)) gapped up 14% in huge volume. Restaurant chain **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) gapped up 6% in weighty volume.


The breadth involved in these gap-ups was encouraging. This is not a rally favoring just a sector or two.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index for June, and existing-home sales for June were better than expected. But the Philadelphia Fed business survey for July and the Federal Housing Finance Agency's price index for May were worse than anticipated.


Friday will be a light day for economic data. Fifteen minutes after the open, the Purchasing Managers' Index for July will be released. The Street's consensus number is 51.9. The range of estimates runs from 50.8 to 52.5, according to Econoday.

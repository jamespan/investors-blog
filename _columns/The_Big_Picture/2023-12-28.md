The stock market hit more new highs Thursday, but those gains faded in late afternoon trade. Meanwhile, [energy drink leader](https://www.investors.com/news/celh-stock-energy-drink-maker-celsius-heats-up-reclaims-50-day-line/) **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and [IBD Leaderboard name](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are stocks to watch in the ongoing uptrend.




In a quiet week of economic data, the Labor Department said first-time jobless claims rose more than expected, to 218,000 vs. 205,000 in the previous week. They were estimated to increase to 210,000, per Econoday.


Continuing claims rose 14,000 from the prior week, hitting 1.875 million. Recurring unemployment claims have increased since mid-September, indicating those already out of work may be having trouble finding a job.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The stock market finished mixed Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% to hit another all-time high. The S&P 500 inched higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost a fraction, even as they both notched fresh 2023 highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 diverged lower, falling 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP122823-250x300.jpg)With just one trading day left in 2023, the Nasdaq is on pace to advance more than 44% on the year. The S&P 500 is up more than 24% year to date and the Dow 30 is up nearly 14%.


Inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was one of the session's biggest gainers, with a 1.6% rise. Still, NKE stock is below its 50-day line after last week's earnings-fueled dive.


On the downside, **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) were among the biggest losers, with declines of 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Boeing is still extended past a cup base's 243.10 entry.


And top growth stocks also moved lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 1%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), sports betting giant **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) inched higher Thursday, as it continues to rebound from its 50-day line. Shares remain in the 5% buy area past a 34.49 buy point.

What To Do Now
--------------


With the stock market hitting more highs at the end of 2023, IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%. If your positions continue to advance and you're making continuous progress in your portfolio, then the top of that range makes sense. But if you're starting to give back some gains, then it makes sense to reduce some exposure.


It's also OK to lock in some gains when leading stocks climb 20% to 25% from their buy points.


Meanwhile, there is a scarcity of new breakouts among leading stocks, which makes sense given it's later in the stock market uptrend. A great resource for finding daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list. It shows MarketSmith Growth 250 stocks topping buy points.


In Thursday's list, there were zero breakouts.


Meanwhile, the MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) is approaching a 126.37 cup-with-handle entry.

Stock Market Leaders: Celsius, Nvidia, Tesla
--------------------------------------------



These stock market leaders are in or near buy zones in today's market action:


Fitness drink leader Celsius raced more than 5% higher Wednesday, bullishly retaking the 50-day line for the first time since early November. Investors could view Wednesday's move as an aggressive entry. The official buy point is 68.95. Investors could use 62.99 or a downward-sloping trendline as other early entries.


[Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) Nvidia remains in the 5% buy zone past a 476.09 double-bottom buy point following a successful test of the 50-day line earlier this month. Now, shares are tracing a flat base that has a 505.48 buy trigger, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/?src=APA1BQ). Nvidia closed Thursday about 2% away from that next entry.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) [stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Tesla skidded more than 3% Thursday, a speed bump for the electric-vehicle giant's breakout past a 252.75 early buy point. TSLA stock continues to trace a double bottom that has a 278.98 buy point. Data on fourth-quarter production and deliveries is expected Tuesday and could spark a volatile response in the stock.

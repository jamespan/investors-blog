Oil Surge Hurts Most Sectors, But Damage Surprisingly Limited
==============================================================

Shockwaves from soaring crude oil prices rattled stocks Monday, but the damage to the stock market was surprisingly modest.




Not only was the selling restrained, but leading stocks escaped nearly unscathed. The IBD 50 rose a remarkable 0.9% even though just one of the 50 stocks is an energy company. A raft of software, finance and leaders from various other sectors helped [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) post a gain.


No, this wasn't an oil shock like in the 1970s, even if Brent crude saw the [largest one-day rise in history](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/15/us-crude-oil-jumps-15percent-after-drone-strikes-disrupt-saudi-crude-production.html). Still, there were repercussions for stocks.


The S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite, of which less than 1% is energy stocks, dropped 0.3% also.

Small caps extended their September rally, making the Russell 2000 one of the few indexes to rise Monday. The Russell 2000 added 0.4%, and is up 6% for the month. Halfway through September, the Russell index has nearly matched its June increase of 6.9%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. This resulted in a [distribution day for the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). But much of that higher NYSE volume was in energy shares that were rising, which seems like an ill-fitting case of distribution.


Advancing stocks actually topped decliners by a 6-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 11-to-10 on the Nasdaq. The market's breadth was another sign that selling was restrained.


In the context of the current uptrend, Monday's losses were tolerable, especially when you factor in the new geopolitical risk.


Series Of Favorable Signs
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP_2x2_091619-263x300.jpg)It was the latest in a series of favorable signs in the past few weeks. The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) whittled down after last week's index gains. With just two on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, there's no big risk of a major market top.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is at the highest level since early May. The NYSE A/D line has been trending higher all year. The Sept. 5 rally was like a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) for the market.


The Aug. 5 index low remains the anchor of the current uptrend. It has not been violated, and indexes are making higher lows.


Weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia's central oil operations [caused major supply disruptions](https://www.investors.com/news/crude-oil-prices-saudi-arabia-attack/) and sent the price of crude oil soaring. U.S. crude oil prices jumped 15% to close at $62.90 per barrel. Brent crude oil prices soared to close near $70 a barrel.


Crude Oil Prices Impact Stocks
------------------------------


The sharp rise in oil prices reverberated across the stock market. The energy sector led, with Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) up 3.4%. Nine of the 10 best performing industry groups were oil related, including drilling and exploration & production.


With the rise in crude spreading to gasoline prices, consumer stocks were among the worst hit Monday. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) slid 1.3% and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) 1%. The retail sector lost 1.2%.


Gasoline isn't the only cost going up. Crude oil is a raw material for plastics and other industrial chemicals, which explains why materials were the worst performing sector. Materials Select Sector SPDR ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) was the weakest S&P sector ETF, down 1.6%. Transportation, a sector married to oil, fell 0.8% as measured by the Dow transportation average.


Is it time to buy oil stocks? Commodity stocks are sensitive to supply and demand news. It's not like investing in growth companies, which can make sustained advances on strong profit outlooks.


Breakouts In Oil Stocks
-----------------------


Investors shopping for oil stocks had some breakouts to study.


Thinly traded **Cheniere Energy Partners** ([CQP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CQP)) broke out of a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) with a 47.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume. Ocean drilling equipment maker **Dril-Quip** ([DRQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRQ)) broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) broke out of a choppy pattern with a 58.37 entry.


**NuStar Energy** ([NS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NS)) rose above the 29.63 [correct entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) in heavy volume but closed below the entry. Refinery operator **HollyFrontier** ([HFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HFC)) tried to break out past a 53.99 buy point in a [long and deep bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/).


While oil industry groups are in the bottom of industry rankings, solar stocks were already leaders with the [No. 2 spot among 197 industries](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-sep-13-2019/). **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) is finding support after pulling back to the 50-day moving average.

  Stocks Fall As Nascent Rebound Takes A Pause

The stock market fell sharply Wednesday, blocking a rebound that had been carefully taking shape.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 slid 1% each, wiping out practically all of the work those indexes made in Tuesday's rally.


Sellers were unimpeded as both indexes sold off into the close. Volume rose on the NYSE, which punished the S&P 500 with another distribution day, i.e. another session in which institutional investors sold aggressively.

With a heavy load of distribution days occurring the past few weeks, the general market finds itself at higher risk than normal. Buying stocks on breakouts past buy points tend to have undesirable consequences. For example, IBD 50 members **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **INC Research** ([INCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCR)) and **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) have failed after hatching out of bases.


The market had started to improve with Thursday's positive price reversals on the major indexes. The S&P 500's reversal was especially comforting because the index bounced right as it touched the 50-day moving average.  Exactly as chart readers would expect, the indexes continued climbing the next few days.


But on Wednesday, investors had reason to believe the rebound was in danger.


The Nasdaq met up against sellers just as  it hit its own 50-day moving average. For two days in a row, the index has been turned back at that price-trend indicator. Bulls have to hope this is merely a momentary pause, rather than the end of the market's bounce. Hence, a move above the Nasdaq's 50-day line is an important guidepost at the moment.


The story on Wall Street on Tuesday was retail. The sector drove the market lower on weak earnings and other bad news. The S&P Retail index tumbled 1.9%.


**Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) plunged 1% to the lowest level since December 2011 after the department store [slashed its profit forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/unwanted-discount-to-guidance-sinks-macys-shares-early/?ven=YahooCP&src=AURLLED&ven=yahoo) for the year. It plans cost cuts and new ways to revive sales.


Macy's report sent a chill across the sector just as other major chains cue up to report earnings. **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) reports on Thursday. Next week, industry titans **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) announce results.


**Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) gapped down to a 5% loss in heavy trading after Piper Jaffray downgraded the discounter to underweight from neutral.


The IBD 50 declined 1.4%. Some of its retail components had the biggest losses, including restaurant chain **Sonic** ([SONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SONC)) (down 4%), **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) (off 4%), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) (-3%) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) (-2.5%).


Oil prices rose, which caused energy stocks to perform better than most. On the flip side, transportation stocks lagged.

The stock market reminded observers Wednesday why it can so easily frustrate the masses.


In the space of just a few hours, it went from showcasing what's good about the current economy to what the institutions are fearing in future months.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP040517-184x300.png)The S&P 500 delighted the bulls in the morning, rising nearly 0.8%, following another robust jobs report courtesy of payrolls processor ADP. But as soon as the latest minutes from a March 14-15 Federal Reserve meeting hit the wires, the large-cap index immediately began sliding at 2 p.m. ET. The sell-off greased its wheels all the way to the finish, leaving the 500 down 0.3% for the day in a 1.1% intraday swing.


The Nasdaq composite went from a 0.6% early gain and all-time highs to a 0.6% decline. The Russell 2000, the big winner in 2016 with a 19.5% gain last year, slid 1.2%.


Volume rose sharply on both exchanges and was above average on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The fresh distribution day on the Nasdaq also triggered the return of a March 24 stalling session, based on IBD's Market School rules. So, the distribution count jumped from three on Tuesday to five on Wednesday.


Losing stocks swamped winners by more than a 2-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq and nearly so on the Big Board.


In the minutes, the U.S. central bank noted that several members of the committee on interest rate policy voiced that equity prices are "quite high relative to standard valuation measures." Such a comment is not real news per se, as numerous Wall Street observers have already noted that some measures of valuation, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, are already well above historical levels.


The possibility that the Fed will begin reducing its government bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities sometime late this year, though, apparently surprised some observers. The Fed added more than $4 trillion in debt to its balance sheet to help keep the cost of money extremely low and encourage businesses to invest and consumers to spend.


In effect, a move to lighten the Fed's balance sheet is a step toward tighter monetary policy. And Reuters reported that before the minutes were released, the New York Federal Reserve bank found that a survey of Wall Street firms found that no change in balance sheet policy was expected until at least the middle of 2018.


Ironically, the Fed minutes did not spur a stampede of selling in the government bond markets. The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield in fact edged slightly lower to around 2.34%.


The Dow Jones utility average, highly sensitive to interest rates, rose 0.6% on Wednesday.


Still others point to comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan, that the road to U.S. corporate tax cuts would be longer than health care reform, as a trigger for the afternoon selling.


Whatever the precise reason why stocks fell, astute IBD readers will focus less on the why and more on what to do now.


Given that the market has made giant gains since the bottoms of March 2009 and October 2011, it makes 100% sense to not get aggressive with new buys. Many of the current leaders have already risen sharply from early or middle-stage bases. While some IPOs have potential, the leadership ranks among those having gone public over the past year or two are still rather thin.


The market uptrend remains under pressure, especially with the fact that the key averages have elevated levels of heavy institutional selling. Yet, most of the recent distribution days showed mild declines. In the S&P 500, just one of the six distribution days saw a decline of more than 0.3%, namely the 1.2% drop on March 21.


Ditto for the Nasdaq: The March 21 drop of 1.8% reflected the market's realization that President Trump and Congress' failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare could mean that other policy moves to jump-start the economy face a stronger headwind than previously thought.


Among the market leaders, keep an eye out for clear-cut sell signals such as the one triggered by **Applied Optoelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)). The stock plunged nearly 13% to 44.68 — the biggest point loss of the stock's run — as volume ballooned nearly five times its 50-day average. A test of the 50-day line looks imminent.
The Sugar Land, Texas-based maker of lasers for fiber-optic telecom networks created a faulty V-shaped cup from March 8 to March 24, and that flawed base showed numerous declines in big volume. Those who bought when the stock cleared a 56.24 buy point have to cut their losses.


In the IBD 50, most stocks that fell hard did so in below-average trade. Keep an eye out, however, for sharp undercuts of the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, big drops in soaring turnover that are then followed by meek rebounds in thin volume, and the round trip of solid gains from proper buy points.


**Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)) has been a fine winner since it rallied out of a cup-shaped base at 37.95 on Feb. 24. It later formed a rare-yet-flawed short-stroke pattern with a 50.10 entry. On Wednesday, the IBD 50 member and consumer-spending play slid nearly 3% to 53.60, closing in on the secondary entry.


Also within the IBD 50, **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) fell in heavy volume, while **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) reversed sharply off its intraday highs. Both stocks should be monitored closely for further signs of weakness. Wall Street bank **Evercore** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)) slid further below its 50-day line, a good reason to lock in gains.
**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) fell nearly 2%, but turnover was light. The chip-equipment giant also is keeping a healthy cushion above its 50-day moving average.

Stocks Pare Gains, Close With Small Gains
==========================================

The stock market held on for a mild win Thursday, doing its best to continue the week's rising path. The Nasdaq reduced a 0.5% advance to just 0.1% by the close. The S&P 500 also faded and came away with only a 0.2% advance. The small-cap Russell 2000 kept pace with the broad market, rising 0.2%. But the Dow transportation average roared more than 1% as air freight, rail and other related industries showed relative strength.

  

Nasdaq and NYSE volume was significantly lower. That suggested institutional investors spent the day on portfolio adjustments rather than wholesale selling.

  

Winners edged out losers on the Nasdaq by a small amount and topped by 8-to-5 on the NYSE. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line is near a one-year high, looking better than the NYSE's lazy A/D line. If both lines can trend upward, consider that a bullish indicator. For now, it's a divergence to monitor.

  

An impasse in debt talks between Greece and its creditors shook Wall Street off its early gains. The indexes had rallied Wednesday on progress in those talks, and the market might have had reason to sell off Thursday on the bad news. Instead, stocks kept building off Tuesday's bullish price reversals.

  

That said, the major indexes still have not broken out of their flattish price channels.

  

In a market like this, good stock picking takes on greater significance. Investors cannot rely on the broad market to win big; it's pure skill that counts now.

  

Those who picked **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) (despite mediocre EPS growth), **Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)) or **Universal Health** ([UHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UHS)) have bragging rights.

  

All three are in the IBD 50, which rose a fraction Thursday.

  

Some professional investors are doing fine with their own stock picking. The IBD Mutual Fund Index (see the bottom of Page B2) is near a new high. A few of the index's growth funds are up more than 10% for the year.

  

But many leading stocks are still plagued by stalled prices or retracements back to buy areas.

  

Perhaps the next batch of breakouts will work better. Some new opportunities for stock pickers have emerged in health care.

  

**Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)) broke out of bases this week or last.

  

The report on retail sales for May was largely positive (see story on Page A1). Spending was up in nearly all categories, notably chains that benefit from strength in housing. Yet retail stocks were mixed and the building products retailing group was little changed Thursday.

Stocks sauntered to minor gains Friday, capping a holiday-shortened week that left the indexes little changed. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The IBD 50 also edged up 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.4% pop.


Volume dropped to a whisper, which is typical for a half session like Friday's.

•Despite rising in eight of the past nine weeks, the major indexes are still off recent highs. However, the IBD Mutual Fund Index has reached its highs of early November, which is a good sign.


•The 200-day moving average remains above the 50-day line on the major indexes, a condition in play since late September for the Nasdaq and late August for the S&P 500. Yet the indexes' 50-day lines have been curving upward rather sharply this month. A recrossing to the normal state — 50-day above the 200-day — would be healthy.


•New highs outnumbered new lows in the past two sessions, ending 11 straight sessions when the lows ruled.


Meanwhile, November has witnessed some breakouts, but few have dazzled.


China-based **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) broke above a 38.75 buy point in a handle earlier this month and now is about 12% extended. Florida-based **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) cleared a short consolidation Nov. 3 and is now almost 7% over the 80.95 buy point.


Other November breakouts have failed to clear the 5% buy zone.


However, for individual investors who got into quality 2015 breakouts earlier this year, the story is better. Dycom is now about 62% above the opening price on a May 20 gap-up from a flat base.


Quality purchases combined with patience have worked well in 2015's market. Just look at **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)).


A couple of highly rated stocks tried to make headway Friday but reversed to give back all or part of the early gains.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) raced almost 7% higher in the first hour of trade but then reversed to trim the gain to 1.5%. Volume was strong. The designer of organic light emitting diode devices for flat panel displays has been popping on rumors that its products will be in **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) 2018 iPhone.


However, rumors don't come with guarantees. Bloomberg News noted in a Nov. 12 article that although Universal Display holds some key OLED patents, **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)) is refining materials that could leapfrog Universal Display's products.


Another stock that started well Friday was **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)). The airline stock advanced 2% at the open and then faded to a less-than-1% gain.


Airline stocks have been consolidating since pegging a high in mid-August. That high came about a week before West Texas Intermediate oil bottomed at around $38 a barrel. On Friday, the price was just under $42. Fuel accounts for roughly a third of airlines' costs.


Because of hedging, many airlines were stuck with higher-priced contracts when the price of oil collapsed.


Now airlines face a new decision: Do they use hedges to lock in current prices or gamble that prices will go lower? **Delta Airlines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) are cutting back on fuel hedges. But **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) is increasing its hedges.


For the week, the Nasdaq and IBD 50 each inched up 0.4%; the S&P 500, up less than 0.1%; and the Dow fell 0.1%. The small cap S&P 600 outperformed, notching a 2% gain for the week.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led mixed stock market action Thursday, as **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rocketed to a record high on what analysts called "surging demand" for AI chips. Next up, investors will shift their attention to Friday's personal income and outlays report, which includes the PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.




Due out at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Commerce Department's April [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-federal-reserve-inflation-rate-is-cooling-at-pivotal-time-for-the-sp-500/), or PCE price index, is expected to rise 0.3% on the month, with a 4.3% annual increase. Wall Street expects the core PCE price index to climb 0.3% month over month, with a 4.6% annual rise.


The stock market uptrend features a number of leading stocks in or near buy zones, with more added this week. **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) and **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) are building new bases, while [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) are some of the most recent breakouts.


Economic Data, Earnings Movers
------------------------------


Ahead of Thursday's market open, initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell to 229,000 vs. 242,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 248,000, per Econoday estimates.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP052523-237x300.jpg)Also, the second estimate of first-quarter GDP from the Commerce Department came in at 1.3%, higher than Wall Street's estimate of 1.1% growth. Further, personal consumption expenditures rose to 3.8% from 3.7% in the previous period. They were expected to remain unchanged.


Chip giant Nvidia spiked 24% after the [company crushed Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvda-stock-nvidia-smashes-estimates-on-strong-data-center-sales/) for its fiscal first quarter on record data-center sales. Chief Executive Jensen Huang said his company is ramping up production to meet demand as the chip industry goes "through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI."


Other key earnings movers included **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)).


Best Buy advanced more than 3%, while Dollar Tree shares tumbled more than 12%. ELF stock, on the [IBD Leaderboard watchlist](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), jumped over 20% on strong [fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/kohls-blasts-off-in-a-big-week-for-retail-earnings/).


[Snowflake reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snow-stock-snowflake-earnings-snowflake-stock-q12023/) first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street targets, but the company's product revenue outlook missed views amid slowing growth for cloud computing partners such as **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). SNOW stock plunged 16.5%. Finally, Splunk erased big gains to finish down 1%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, extending a losing streak to five sessions and falling further below its 50-day line. It is now testing the 200-day line.


The S&P 500 rebounded 0.9%, snapping a two-day slide and finding support around its own 50-day line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 1.7%, nearly erasing the past two days of losses. Finally, the small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%, closing at its lowest level since May 17.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is still at one, while S&P 500's count dropped to six after the April 20 distribution day aged out after 25 trading sessions.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) inched higher, ending a two-day losing streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)) surged 10%, triggering the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/) after a 20% breakout gain in three weeks or less.


There was narrow participation in Thursday's advance. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) inched lower and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) moved up just 0.5%. Despite the Nasdaq's surge, more than twice as many Nasdaq stocks fell than rose on Thursday.


With the Nasdaq just off its 2023 highs — the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) is already at new highs — IBD's recommended market exposure sits at 40%-60%.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Monday.com, Okta
-----------------------------------------------



Software maker Monday.com pared gains to 0.9% Thursday, closing just shy of a 171.99 buy point in a cup base, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


On May 15, Monday.com [reported first-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mndy-stock-monday-stock-q12023/) that surged past analyst estimates. The work-management software firm also further outlined its road map for building artificial intelligence apps into its platform.


[Recent IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/okta-stock-cybersecurity-leader-eyes-breakout-ahead-of-earnings-report/) pick Okta is approaching an 87.98 buy point in a cup base. Meanwhile, an early entry is also in play at 86.89, which is past Tuesday's high price. Earnings are due out Wednesday, so any breakout would carry additional risk.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is nearing new highs ahead of a potential breakout.

Bullishly, the stock's relative strength line hit a new high Wednesday, confirming the cybersecurity giant as a stock market leader.

The 5% buy area tops out at 80.22.


One of the world's leading cruise companies, Royal Caribbean has a global fleet of 64 ships traveling to about 1,000 destinations worldwide.


Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor advanced 12% Thursday, breaking out past a 95.92 double-bottom entry. The 5% buy area runs up to 100.72, so the stock is slightly extended.

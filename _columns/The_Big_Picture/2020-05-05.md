The stock market, even in a confirmed uptrend, never travels in a straight line. And Tuesday's late-hour sell-off proved this once again.




However, after a big run from the March 23 lows, no one should be surprised by some profit-taking, especially given that we're still in the meat of earnings season.


The Nasdaq composite led a fairly broad rally, rising 1.1%. But at session highs, its gain reached nearly 2.3%. If you consider the true trading range, starting with Monday's close of 8710, then on Tuesday the Nasdaq finished almost smack-dab in the middle of this price range.


The Nasdaq 100, covering the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, also gained 1.1%, outrunning gains of 0.9% by the S&P 500, nearly 0.8% by the Russell 2000 and 0.6% by the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.


[The FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) pretty much moved in tandem with the Nasdaq indexes.


True market leaders fared better. [At least six stocks in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), including global consumer spending and stay-at-home play **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), rallied 2% or more. Domino's chart action got discussed in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958).

The Dow Jones continues to hold a decent cushion after a test of institutional support at the 50-day moving average Monday. Yet the Nasdaq has been moving much more quickly toward erasing its year-to-date losses. At 8809, the composite still has a ways to go before returning above 8900. But losses since Jan. 1 have been cut to less than 2%.


Stock Market Today: Bullish Internals Again
-------------------------------------------


Winners edged losers by a narrow 7-6 margin on the Nasdaq. The ratio was nearly 3-to-2 on the NYSE. Looking at IBD's 197 industry groups, growth-oriented ones flourished. Education, education software, financial software, computer networking, specialty enterprise software, chip equipment, leisure products, medical services, ethical drugs and biotech all rallied 2.5% or higher, according to early data.


You can track all the price-based changes of these 197 industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


Among the leaders, some companies are flashing [solid breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), but volume is lighter than you'd like to see. This can happen when Wall Street is waiting for the quarterly report. In other cases, volume may slowly roll in, then come in with a bang. [Leaderboard's newest member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), online education services expert **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), offers the latest example. Volume skyrocketed past 38 million shares; over the past 50 trading sessions, 2.1 million shares on average traded hands.

What Not To Do Right Now
------------------------


[As noted in the IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958), various [psychological indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) suggest that we are nowhere close to conditions that would indicate a major bear market (such as the ones in 2000 and 2008) is here. On the other hand, coronavirus has hobbled some industries, and it could take years before they can get back to pre-2020 levels.



So, as an individual investor, never let your guard down. Avoiding these five mistakes will help boost your chances of picking great winning stocks and celebrating a bullish 2020.


1. Chasing top stocks at a price well more than 5% above the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The only exception to this? [Powerful breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). Patience often pays off when you miss the initial thrust past a breakout level. A true market leader will offer secondary entry points, such as a [big bounce off the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Are you uncomfortable with the [latest cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) that's formed? Maybe a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) will emerge.


2. Grabbing shares on the way down. Not all stocks will participate in this budding new uptrend. Some beaten down names, such as **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)), are falling hard again after failing to rise back above their sharply falling 50-day lines. Norwegian tanked 22% after the company commented that it faces serious risk of going bankrupt.


3. Buying before a true breakout in mediocre names. In a stock that shows all-star fundamentals and [plentiful ownership among A-rated mutual funds](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-stocks-are-best-mutual-funds-buying-your-watchlist-stocks-how-to-find-out/), you may be able to find an [early entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) with a careful analysis of the chart. ([IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) has focused on early entries in numerous top growth stocks.)


4. Getting too greedy with your winners. [Taking gains at 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is excellent portfolio management. Currently, few companies have triggered the eight-week hold rule.


5. Settling for the shell instead of the oyster. The biggest winners tend to lead their industry groups or their sector. Companies with weaker fundamentals ultimately will produce weaker breakouts. They may join the party late.

There's an old saying on Wall Street: "Never short a dull market." If recent market action is any indication, the Street seems to agree.


Major averages opened slightly lower Wednesday but gained their footing about one hour into the session. Gains were mild by the close and volume was mixed, but the indexes traded in another tight range, refusing to give up much ground.


The Dow and S&P 500 each rose 0.5% while the Nasdaq gained 0.4%. NYSE volume rose slightly from Tuesday's level. Nasdaq volume fell a bit. The Russell 2000 added 0.1% while the IBD 50 eased 0.1%.


The Dow got a lift from **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). Shares rose as much as 7%, but the stock ended with a 4% gain after China announced it will open its market for clearing domestic bank-card transactions. The news gives Visa direct access to a huge market. Visa briefly cleared a 69.76 flat-base buy point but ended 2.5% below it.


Dull markets are good for the bulls in one sense because action is generally quiet and less volatile. It certainly has been that lately.


On the other hand, it's not an easy environment for breakouts to gain traction. Stocks like **Sucampo Pharmaceuticals** ([SCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCMP)), **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)), **Hooker Furniture** ([HOFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOFT)) and **Astronics** ([ATRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATRO)) are working nicely, but they're not the best institutional-quality names.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has struggled to make progress after a recent base breakout over 82.09. In after-hours trading, shares slumped after earnings topped expectations but sales missed by a hair.


Wednesday's session yielded some powerful breakouts but not in the growth space. In the large-cap space, **St. Jude Medical** ([STJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STJ)), **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) and **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) blasted out of bases in heavy volume.


Breakouts from **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Wabtec** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)) looked good for a while but faded by the close.


China-based **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) tried to clear a cup-with-handle buy point of 36.60 but came up short. It touched an intraday high of 36.60 before settling for a 0.7% gain. The provider of K-12 after-school tutoring services shows big sales growth in recent quarters.


Homebuilders lagged Wednesday despite better-than-expected March existing-home sales data. IBD's homebuilding industry group gave up 1.3%. March new-home sales data are due Thursday.

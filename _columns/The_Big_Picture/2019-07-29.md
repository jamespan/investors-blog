title: Nasdaq Leads Drop, But This Has Yet To Happen In July; 5 Warning Signs To Watch Right Now

The Nasdaq composite made a gnarly morning look not as bad by day's end, a hint that institutional appetite for U.S. equities still favors the bulls. But leading stocks certainly felt the brunt of the session's profit-taking.




The first 45 minutes of trade belonged to the bears. By 10:15 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq had dropped 1%. But bargain hunters steadily ate into that deficit. A 0.4% drop by Monday's close certainly was more palatable. The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, compressed a 1% early loss into less than 0.4%.


Volume fell on both main exchanges. The Nasdaq has yet to log a down day in above-average turnover this month.


In fact, the Nasdaq has seen just one session that saw volume ramp higher than average: The 1.1% gap-up on July 1.

Large caps in general cut their losses even better than the Nasdaq, even as bunches of stocks in the oil and gas, commercial services, software, building and cyclical areas of the market retreated 1.5% or more. The S&P 500 actually showed rangebound trading: It fell less than 0.2%, and Monday's high and low proved narrower than on Friday's session. (See the daily changes of 197 industry groups each day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Small caps continued to underperform. The S&P 600 and the Russell 2000 both sank 0.5% to 0.6%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.2%, less than the 1.6% slide seen in the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) exchange traded fund.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP072919-201x300.jpg)As seen in the accompanying Market Pulse, the Nasdaq's distribution-day count contracted as a June 21 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) expired on time. Once 25 trading sessions have passed following a significant decline in higher volume, IBD perceives that day's intense professional selling as no longer relevant to the [current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


The third quarter for stocks remains positive, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have all hit new highs in the past few days. But what are the signs that the bull market could hit the brakes? Here are five factors to consider.


**Beyond Nasdaq: Watch For This First Bad Sign**
------------------------------------------------


Watch for a sharp rise in distribution days. An escalation in the current war on trade, intellectual-property rights and other regulations impacting imports between the U.S. and China could spark additional sell-offs on Wall Street. Already, optimism on a new round of talks in China starting Tuesday appears low.


The political environment is still charged on Capitol Hill, although tensions have eased somewhat after President Donald Trump and Congress agreed on a budget deal last week.


**Second Bad Sign**
-------------------


Monitor IBD's key [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) for terrible action by true market leaders. They often lead the market lower.



**HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) has staged a dramatic decline in the past few weeks. On July 19, the big cap lender snipped its 50-day moving average in heavy share turnover, [triggering a key sell rule in the process](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The 80 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-h-d-f-c-bank-ltd-adr-hdb.aspx), may still seem solid. But it's fallen a lot since registering a 94 seven weeks ago. Keep in mind that the RS Rating is best used for stock selection, not market timing in individual growth stocks.


**Insperity** ([NSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSP)) plunged nearly 25% in a whale of turnover and tanked below its 50- and 200-day lines. Its Q2 earnings increase of 22% to 83 cents simply matched Wall Street's view. The Kingwood, Texas-based outsourcer of employee-related payroll and workers' compensation insurance also posted its smallest EPS gain in nine quarters.


Revenue growth at Insperity ticked lower, to 13%, down mildly from year-over-year increases of 14% to 17% in the prior five quarters. Reports said Insperity narrowed its full-year outlook.



What could counter bearish action in individual leaders? In a word: rotation.


Lately, a few chip plays are firming up. **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)), **KLA** ([KLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLA)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) have broken out and are acting fine.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) shows one chipmaker joining the list in June: **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)).


**Bad Sign No. 3**
------------------


Stay alert on news indicating a severe economic contraction is headed this way. Business confidence and manufacturing surveys showed awful declines in the months ahead of the 2008 market crash.


The [Econoday economic calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) — which on Monday highlighted a 9.3 reading by the Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey in July, up from 8.9 in June — will shed light on U.S. income and spending for July on Tuesday, the ADP private sector jobs report on Wednesday, construction spending Thursday and U.S. nonfarm payrolls for July on Friday.


An earnings recession may still be in the cards. Glenmede, the $40 billion asset manager, notes a bifurcation likely in this aspect of fundamentals as seven out of 11 S&P sectors could still post a year-over-year drop in profits. Chief Investment Officer Jason Pride notes in a client note that health care is on track to contribute positively to overall S&P 500 earnings, "particularly providers and services-oriented companies."


"Sectors such as industrials and materials are having a larger impact on the downside," Pride wrote.


**Bad Sign No. 4**: A Big Spike In Interest Rates
-------------------------------------------------


Of course, this hardly seems likely in the near term. But history has shown that a big rise in rates can stop a bull market in its tracks.


Let's quickly take a look back at a few historical precedents.


* Jan. 2 to Oct. 8, 1987: seven moves, including two small cuts, in the fed funds interest rate from 5.88% to 7.31% (or to be precise, 7 and five-16ths percent); the Dow Jones fell 41% that year, from 2746 to 1616 in eight weeks.
* March 30, 1988 to May 17, 1989: 15 rate hikes 6.5% to 9.81%; the Nasdaq fell 5% in June 1989, then sank 16% from a high of 487 in October 1989 to 409 four months later. Also, the Nasdaq collapsed 31% over a three-month stretch from July to October 1990.
* Feb. 4, 1994 to Feb. 1, 1995: seven rate hikes from 3% to 6%; the S&P 500 slid just under 10% from 482 to 435 in less than two months from February to April 1994. But the large-cap benchmark needed another 10 months to make an all-time new high in February 1995.
* June 30, 1999 to May 16, 2000: six rate hikes from 4.75% to 6.5%; the Nasdaq peaked at 5132 in March 2000 and eventually fell 78% by October 2002.


Observers still think that the Fed may cut interest rates by more than a quarter point this year as a measure of economic insurance.


"It's not even clear that central banks themselves understand what's going on," Christopher Smart, head of the Barings Investment Institute, wrote in a new client note. "Lower unemployment doesn't seem to nudge inflation higher, as it once did. Commodity prices may, but not reliably."

At around $2.72 a pound, a 3.4% year-to-date gain for the metal considered to have a Ph.D. in economics seems to reaffirm forecasts of mild global economic growth.


**Last Bad Sign**: Will Investors Get Complacent?
-------------------------------------------------


Amid the generally light market pullback, the [CBOE Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) rose 6%. But at 12.91, it's down sharply from the 22 level back on Oct. 10, when IBD responded to a flurry of serious distribution days with a downgrade in the current outlook to "market in correction" from "uptrend under pressure."

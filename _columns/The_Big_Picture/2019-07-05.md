Stock Market Win Streak Ends, But Technicals Show Promise
==========================================================

Stock market bulls found consolation on the technical side Friday, despite the end of the Nasdaq's win streak at six days.




[Blue chips](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.9% but then reversed course to close with a less than 0.2% loss. The Nasdaq slipped 0.1%, and the S&P 500 less than 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.2%.


Volume in the post-holiday session was higher but only because Wednesday's session was a half day. Friday's trade adjusted for the half session was lower.


Positive reversals, like those Friday, are bullish signs for the stock market.


Be Ready For Stock Market Breakouts
-----------------------------------


In the coming week, individual investors should cull their watchlists for the near-actionable stocks.

Market watchers have their eyes on the stock market technicals. Most are positive.


Stock Market Technicals
-----------------------


* The Nasdaq continues to struggle near the 8,000 to 8,175 level. Resistance first appeared there in September. After a rebound, the Nasdaq stalled in late April at 8,176, confirming resistance.Â A third test is still underway.


But the S&P 500 appears to have cleared a test around 2,950.


* Another factor is new highs for stocks. In the six sessions including the Fourth of July, new highs wrested control from new lows. This is a good sign, though more evidence would be welcome.
* The percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving average hit 63% Friday, the highest mark this year. The current level is neither too many nor too few, which is what bulls like to see.
* Bullish market advisors are at the 55.2% level, according to Investors Intelligence. The last time bulls were at 55% was late April to early May. A market pullback followed.


Recession Fears Overblown
-------------------------


The stock market struggled Friday after the nonfarm payrolls figure for June came in 35% stronger than expected. Investors took it as a signal that the Federal Reserve would be cautious about cutting rates.


While the strong job numbers disappointed investors Friday, on a long-term basis it was good news. The numbers suggested that recession fears are overblown.


Brazil Stocks Jump On Pension News
----------------------------------


The wreck called Brazil got some good news last week. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF ([EWZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWZ)) sped 3.1% higher. Reuters reported Thursday that a pension overhaul bill cleared a congressional hurdle. Pension changes are considered important to reviving Brazil's economy.



Of the 29 Brazil stocks on U.S. exchanges, 28 rose Friday. Former IBD leader **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) led with a 17% gain.

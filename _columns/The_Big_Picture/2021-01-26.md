title: Is The Stock Market Insane? Beyond GameStop, Major Indexes Hint Not Yet

Some folks in the C-suite "kinda love Etsy." (See Elon Musk's tweet.) Others apparently love to squeeze the shorts hard. Very, very hard.




Ultimately, though, here's the truth about the stock market and stock investing: It's still a daily game of measuring demand vs. supply.


On Tuesday, the broader picture showed a relative lack of fresh institutional demand for equities. Yet the big boys and girls on Wall Street also weren't so eager to dump a major supply of shares onto the public, either.


A 0.7% drop by the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund and a 1% slide by SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) proved to bear the worst of the day's selling. In contrast, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all finished around 0.1% lower.


![MP012621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP012621-186x300.jpg)Megacap techs, meanwhile, did better. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on the Nasdaq, rallied almost 0.2%. At 328.59, its 4.7% gain since Jan. 1 looks quite handsome so far — especially after QQQ rallied 47.6% higher in 2020.


And QQQ looks set for a solid Wednesday open on the back of a huge lift in quarterly earnings and sales by **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) after the market close. The [half position in IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) zoomed 4% higher and at one point rose to as high as 247.70 after hours. That marks an 8.5% advance past a 228.22 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) within its shallow base.

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Monday.


While the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the 500 looks high, don't forget that only one of these sell-offs showed a decline of 1% or more. For more detail, read [Friday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-ends-mixed-sp500-suffers-mild-distribution/).


Why The Stock Market Can Be A Place Of Insanity
-----------------------------------------------


Of course, QQQ's gain in 2021 looks like a blip on a 5-minute chart on one of the hottest retail stocks this year: **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)).


Shares in the struggling video game and console chain romped 93% higher on Tuesday to all-time highs. As discussed on [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), the company had gotten battered amid heavy short sales by hedge funds. But a brigade of small traders, sharing communications via a popular forum on Reddit.com called wallstreetbets, has banded together in an effort to force such short sellers to cover their bearish stock and option positions.


After hours, GME rocketed another 68% to as high as 248.90.



Data from a [MarketSmith weekly chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) showed that the level of short interest in GameStop just a few weeks ago showed that roughly half of the 66.3 million-share float was sold short. You can calculate the short interest as a percentage of the total float, or the number of shares freely traded, by reading this [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-short-interest/).


Looking at the accompanying Market Pulse table, a decent number of leading growth stocks showed nifty gains in above-average turnover. Such action bespeaks healthy institutional demand.


Is The Stock Market Insane? Or Just Cooling Off
-----------------------------------------------



But **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) reflected the exact opposite during its 6.2% backslide on Tuesday.


Volume cruised 52% above normal levels to 655,500 shares as the midcap flopped underneath a 212.65 [buy point](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [eight-week cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/). Clearly, funds have used the recent run-up as a chance to sell into strength.


It's extremely important to make buys and sells based on research-driven rules and to follow them consistently. **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), which went into Tuesday's session ranked No. 1 in both the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), is a perfect case in point.


The Beauty Of Charts
--------------------


Etsy offers a good example of why it's important not to buy shares willy-nilly after a well-known entrepreneur expresses affection.



When was the right time to buy Etsy? When it traversed past a 154.98 cup entry on Nov. 27 last year. That base formed in a neighborly fashion to another cup that held a 141.51 buy point. Since the breakout, shares rose as much as 28% in three weeks. Such a sterling gain in short form triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/).


That breakout arrived just weeks after the [Dow industrials and S&P 500 both followed through on Nov. 4](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/). Makes sense, doesn't it? Amid an economy hit hard by coronavirus, the Nov. U.S. elections had taken place a day earlier. It wasn't yet official that Joe Biden would become POTUS No. 46 and that the Democrats would see a sweep of two Georgia seats in the U.S. Senate. Yet Wall Street, relieved that the elections were finally over, looked ahead.


The Federal Reserve began its first two-day meeting on interest rates Tuesday. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note held firm at 1.05%, up 12 basis points since the start of 2021.

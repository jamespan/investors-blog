A day after the stock market outlook weakened, indexes showed they weren't ready to bounce right back.




The Nasdaq reversed lower and closed near session lows, off 0.4% on the day. There was one reason for hope: The Nasdaq held above the important 50-day moving average. Lower volume on the composite also eased the sting.


The S&P 500 rose 0.1% after being up as much as 0.5%. That's stalling action, but volume was lower on the NYSE, helping the S&P 500 avoid a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Despite the limp close, the index is so far finding support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which is a guide on market direction in the short term.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, the best major index in a lackluster day. The Russell 2000 dropped 0.3%.


The IBD 50 and its tracking Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) faded just like the broad market. The IBD 50 ended with a gain of less than 0.1%; the ETF fell 0.5%. Still, both are holding above their 50-day moving averages.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP_4x4_050521-192x300.jpg)On Tuesday, heavy losses in the Nasdaq caused IBD to change its market outlook from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure." Investors should be more selective with stock purchases while the market negotiates this rough spot. Taking some profits to raise cash is another smart move.


Stock Market Complexion Changing
--------------------------------


For now, the stock market's decline is milder than the one in February and early March. Yet, the market's complexion is changing.


A number of technology leaders got mauled. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) continues to thrash lower. Since trying to break out last week, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is fizzling. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is rolling over, back near its 246.23 buy point.


In the IBD 50, only a half-dozen technology stocks are on the list, and most are in poor condition. **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) is below its 544.93 buy point. **Zebra Technologies** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)) and **Ultra Clean Holdings** ([UCTT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UCTT)) are below the 50-day line. **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)) has spent months below the 50-day.


At the same time, cyclicals, financial and consumer shares are among those asserting themselves. Today, the most common sectors in the IBD 50 are finance, consumer and building stocks. That seems like a reprise of the February stock market, when growth also went out of favor and real economy stocks led.


The S&P remains the leading index, up 11% this year, thanks to strength in those sectors. Wednesday's breakout stocks told that story, and investors willing to risk the current market have choices in those areas.


Mining company **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) broke out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with an 88.39 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Chemicals supplier **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) topped the 67.37 buy point in big volume.


**Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. It was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) on the bullish move.


In construction products, **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)) broke out of a base in heavy volume. **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) is sailing above a breakout at 75.70.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is breaking out of a cup base.


International stocks also did well Wednesday. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF ([VEA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEA)) added 1.2%. Schwab International Equity ETF ([SCHF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHF)), which tracks a global index that excludes U.S. stocks, rose 1.3%.


Energy was the strongest S&P sector, up more than 3%. Eight of the best-performing IBD industry groups Wednesday were oil and gas.


Semiconductors showed relative strength. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) rose 0.4% despite paring gains.

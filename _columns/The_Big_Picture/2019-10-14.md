  Stock Market Eases On Doubts About Trade War, But Top Stocks Outperform

The stock market did minimal work Monday, turning in a listless session that seemed to reflect uncertainty about the U.S.-China trade war.




Indexes closed about 0.1% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 did not undercut Friday's low, and the Nasdaq composite barely undercut its Friday low. So, at a minimum the market's doubts did not result in new selling.


Significantly, the three indexes held above their 50-day moving averages, which are acting as a measuring stick for the market's direction.


Small caps lagged. (Haven't we said that 100 times this year?) The Russell 2000 and S&P 600 fell 0.4%. Both closed below the 50-day moving average, just one session after rising above the line.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP101419-249x300.jpg)On Friday, stocks surged after the U.S. and China reached a tentative deal that halted [new tariffs on Chinese imports](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/what-is-a-tariff/) and China agreed to purchase more U.S. agricultural products. The deal was described as the first step in further talks.


But investors — stung by multiple setback in the trade war — seemed to remain skeptical. Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials want [more talks this month to finalize terms](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-13/stocks-in-asia-to-advance-after-trade-progress-markets-wrap?srnd=premium) of last week's agreement. Chinese media also [expressed reservations](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/14/what-chinese-media-are-saying-about-the-partial-trade-deal-with-the-us.html). Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounded optimistic on CNBC.


While the stock market didn't react much Monday to the news, crude oil traders showed skepticism. The price of U.S. crude oil fell more than 2% to $53.47 a barrel. Copper fell in early trading but recovered to close slightly higher.


Slow Activity In Stock Market
-----------------------------


Relatively few stocks made new highs Monday, and few [rose in unusual volume](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=ups). These market barometers offered more evidence that the market is unpersuaded to buy. Volume fell sharply from Friday's trading.


[Heavy distribution since mid-September](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) is another reason to remain guarded. IBD's market outlook is still "uptrend under pressure" until better behavior appears. Earnings season kicks off this week with several bank company reports, which brings new risks.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) slightly outperformed the general market Monday, up 0.1%. Read that as a positive sign while the market continues to sort itself out.


Yet, most IBD 50 stocks were lackluster. **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/lulu-stock-ibd-50-stocks-to-watch/) company, tried to break out of a flat base but it closed below the 204.54 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and volume was flat.



Much of the index's performance came from a single stock: **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)). The maker of equipment for cosmetic procedures shot up 11.5%. There was no news on the company, but the new issue already has a reputation for volatile trading.

[IBD 50 stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) that are basing and worth a look include **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)), **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)).


Retail Lags Stock Market
------------------------


While most sectors were quiet, retail was Monday's weakest. Department stores, mail order retailing and restaurants were some of the weakest industry groups. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) fell 1% after meeting resistance at its 200-day line twice this month.


In economic news, Chinese imports fell 8.5% in September from a year ago, which was a bigger decline than expected.


David Kelly, chief global strategist of JPMorgan Funds, said in a note Monday that Friday's trade announcement could indeed mark a turning point.


"As a practical matter these are only small concessions on both sides and a comprehensive deal between China and the U.S. may well have to wait until after next November's U.S. elections," Kelly said. "However, the fact that the negotiators were so anxious to announce a deal suggests that both sides now appreciate the damage being done to their economies by the conflict. This probably reduces the risk of a re-escalation of the war in the months ahead."

The stock market ended a mostly quiet session with mixed action Thursday amid a worse-than-expected jobless claims report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the major stock indexes with a 0.3% rise, extending a win streak to five sessions.




The S&P 500 inched higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than 0.2%, or 39 points. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 edged higher. Leading growth stocks also outperformed, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.2%. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq vs. Wednesday's session. NYSE volume was slightly lower, according to preliminary data.

Stock Market Rally Extends Gains
--------------------------------


This week's string of positive action underscores how quickly sentiment can shift in the stock market and the importance of remaining flexible based on the daily action of the major stock indexes. Last Thursday, the stock market suffered its worst day since mid-March, during the height of the coronavirus bear market. Investors should have cut back some exposure due to that sharp break and the weak action among top growth stocks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP061820-264x300.jpg)Now, the Nasdaq is on a five-day win streak and just off its recently-set record highs. Amid the positive action, the number of distribution days is back to a very-light count. There is one on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500, and investors should be back on the hunt for breakout stocks.


Among top growth stocks, a number of stock market leaders found strong support at their 10-week moving averages in recent sessions. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) both rebounded from their 50-day lines this week. Meanwhile, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) blasted to new highs Thursday with a 5.6% advance after approaching the 10-week line last week.


Other leaders are breaking out past three-weeks-tight add-on entries. IBD [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) member **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) moved past a 160.99 add-on buy point from a three-weeks-tight this week. According to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) commentary, "PayPal is extended from a short-stroke follow-on entry. But it is above a three-weeks-tight entry at 160.99."



Breakout Stocks To Watch
------------------------


Breakout stocks to watch in the current stock market rally include **Activision** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)).


Activision is trying to break out past a 76.07 entry in a flat base. For now, the video game maker is having difficulty clearing the new buy point. The new entry comes on the heels of a successful breakout past a 64.63 entry in a cup base on April 15.


A potential downside is the stock's lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/). It remains pretty far from its high on May 13. The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter to confirm the strength of the breakout.


Alteryx surged 6.5% Thursday to break out past a 151.60 buy point in a cup with handle, ending the session out of the buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 159.18.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Alteryx stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-alteryx-inc-cl-a-ayx.aspx) has an 85 out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the middle tier of growth stocks. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.


Alteryx was [Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/alteryx-stock-moves-into-buy-zone-as-data-analytics-grows-in-importance/), as it made its first attempt to break out.


Cup With Handle Breakout
------------------------


Lam Research stock broke out past a 310.10 entry in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) on Wednesday with a 2.7% gain. Shares gained 0.3% Thursday and are still in buy range. The 5% buy zone runs up to 325.61.


[Today's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/paylocity-ibd-stock-of-the-day-gets-an-upgrade-and-moves-into-buy-zone/), Paylocity, advanced past a 140.81 entry in a cup with handle. Shares jumped 7.1% after an RBC Capital Markets analyst hiked the price target on Paylocity stock from 120 to 155 and upgraded the rating to outperform.


Teradyne broke out past a 78.29 entry in a cup with handle. Shares moved up 1.5% Thursday and remained in buy range.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) hit another new high, marking the stock as a potential winner in the current stock market rally. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the broad market. Last week, the [semiconductor test equipment maker](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/teradyne-stock-nears-buy-point-chip-equipment-spending-rebounds/) was an [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) ahead of a potential breakout move.

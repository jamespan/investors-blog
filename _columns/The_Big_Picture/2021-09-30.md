Stock Market Ends September With Ugly Reversal; Why The Outlook Is Worse Today
===============================================================================

Pin the reason for Thursday's stock market drop on anything you wish.




Was it lingering worries over how the U.S. will address its debt mountain — beyond a newly passed budget stopgap bill in Congress? Or more evidence that China's manufacturing juggernaut is now in recession? Will crude oil really hit $100 a barrel? Or maybe the big boys and girls on Wall Street simply see valuations for equities out of whack, given that economic growth may slow amid ongoing supply chain challenges?


These types of questions remain unanswered and debatable. But one thing is undeniable. After a strong run through three quarters of 2021, stocks of all stripes showed all this week they're tired. And a break might serve the longer-term uptrend well.


Yet, stock market bears ruled the day. Small initial gains got clawed away after only 30 minutes of trading. And thus the S&P 500 saw an initial 0.5% pop fizzle into a 1.2% drop by Thursday's end. The large-cap benchmark didn't quite undercut Sept. 20's "Evergrande scare" low. Yet at 4307, the S&P 500 still marked a 10-week closing low.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP093021-256x300.jpg)Down 4.8% for the month of September, the S&P 500 snapped an impressive seven-month winning streak.


Institutions Are Selling Heavily
--------------------------------


A weak stock market begins a session bullishly and ends bearishly. The Nasdaq composite, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average behaved in line with the S&P 500's action Thursday. They fell 0.4%, 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. the prior session. In other words, Thursday's action exemplified another session of institutional distribution.


It's not often that you see the Nasdaq itself rack a [fourth straight distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), too. On Monday, the Nasdaq fell 0.5% as turnover jumped. That preceded a 2.8% plunge on Tuesday and another 0.2% drop Wednesday, each day in accelerating turnover.


This unified decline, coupled with an absence of fantastic breakouts among [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/)-quality issues, justifies a change in the current outlook for the stock market to "market in correction."


The word correction, by itself, is vague. A mild correction trims major indexes around 5% to 9% from their 52-week or all-time highs. Get to 10% to 19% declines, and IBD likes to use the term "intermediate correction." Veterans on Wall Street agree that a 20% drop or more defines a bear market.


After more than doubling from its March 2020 low of 2191 and streaking to new highs for months, the S&P 500 certainly deserves a rest.


Think of this new downgrade in the outlook for equities as a red light on a traffic signal. Now is not the time to be making brand-new buys. Your chances of making money on the long side? Slim at best.


Even defensive sectors, such as REITs, food and utilities, are backtracking fast. Just look at how far **American Tower** ([AMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMT)), **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) and **Hershey** ([HSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY)) have ducked below their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) lately. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)), down 0.8% for the day, is trading below its 200-day moving average, a key long-term technical level.

What To Do Now
--------------


No one knows when this market will turn around. But the determined investor can begin preparing now by taking these actions.


First, cut losses quickly in your worst performers. Take at least some profits in your biggest gainers if they are failing to hold at their 10-week or 40-week lines. Unless you have a giant profit cushion, you might not be able to withstand a correction that sends a stock all the way back down to your original entry point.


Second, employ the power of [IBD's stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) to generate an excellent watchlist.


Third, brush up on the principles of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). Not every follow-through works. Head-fake rallies happen. But since 1900, IBD research shows every major market bottom featured one.


Will More Bears Join The Stock Market?
--------------------------------------


Bullishness on Wall Street has receded. But it's not as if the overall sentiment among investors has turned completely dark.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) has not climbed past 1.15 for well more than a year. The [Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) still shows bulls at a higher ratio than bears. And the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), while up a third time in four sessions, is nowhere close to its year-to-date peak of 37.21 seen on Jan. 27.


Thursday's outflow from stocks seemed to help stanch the bleeding in long-dated U.S. Treasury debt markets.


The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond dipped 1 basis point to 1.52% — the first decline in the cost of money in eight sessions.

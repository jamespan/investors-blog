Stocks Bounce Off Steep Losses, But A Contrarian Gauge Is Worth Watching
=========================================================================

The stock market was not ready to give in to fear Monday, impressively digging itself out of a deep intraday hole. The bullish move keeps the market's direction upright.




The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 1.8% on news that a new strain of the coronavirus was spreading quickly in the United Kingdom. The London FTSE 100 slid 1.7%, the German DAX 2.8% and the Paris CAC 40 2.4%.


As some countries banned travel from the U.K, travel stocks faltered. IBD's [airline industry group fell around 1.1%](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-uk-coronavirus-mutation-us-readies-more-aid/) even after paring losses. Travel booking, lodging and restaurant groups lost more than 1%. U.S. crude oil plunged nearly 6% but reduced its loss to less than 3%.


The Covid-19 headlines overshadowed news Sunday that congressional leaders reached an agreement on [a $900 billion stimulus bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/answers-to-your-top-questions-about-the-600-stimulus-checks.html) after weeks of negotiations. The bill includes one-time relief payments of $600 per qualifying person. In another positive headline for the market, the FDA granted emergency approval for **Moderna**'s ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) Covid-19 vaccine late Friday.


![MP122120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP122120-243x300.jpg)But after the first awful hour of trading, the U.S. stock market started to rebound. The Nasdaq closed barely 0.1% lower.


The S&P 500 narrowed its loss to 0.4%. For the second time in about two weeks, the S&P 500 pulled back to the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and found support. Those are encouraging chart signals.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased all losses and closed 0.1% higher. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) gave the Dow a boost after the athletic apparel maker [beat profit and sales estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-nike-earnings-q2-2021/) after Friday's close.


Small caps were about as good: The Russell 2000 reversed higher to close with a fraction higher. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF fell less than 0.1%.


Too Much Optimism In Stock Market?
----------------------------------


With such resilience on Wall Street and indexes near record highs, no wonder investor fear is scarce. Gushing optimism remains one of the stock market's defining characteristics. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) closed below 0.6 for more than four weeks. That's the longest stretch in eight years. Monday's reading of 0.61 broke the streak.


Because this is a contrarian indicator, the excess froth should be reason for investors to be cautious.


However, investors have reason to continue with a heavy exposure to stocks, at least for now. Growth stocks are performing as well as any other market gauge. The IBD 50 eased 0.3%.



The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)), which tracks a portfolio of quality stocks topping key resistance levels, climbed an applause-worthy 0.6%. The ETF, in fact, has been one of the best investments since November, up 36.2% from its Nov. 2 low.


The pipeline of new breakouts continued to flow Monday. IBD 50 stock **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), an [IBD Stock of the Day last week](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chegg-stock-nears-buy-point-on-online-education-momentum/), topped the 90.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a cup base.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq. Early data showed lower NYSE volume.


The S&P 500 still has five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). That's borderline worrisome, and surely a trend to watch. The market is vulnerable to certain headlines, as we've seen. Yet, the overall trend remains positive.


In a research note Monday morning, UBS said it maintains a positive outlook in the medium term. Quoting an official with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the new vaccine appears to be effective against new strains of the coronavirus.

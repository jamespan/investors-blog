Semiconductor Stocks Fuel Early Rally For Nasdaq But Gains Fade
================================================================

Monday was shaping up to be a good session for the stock market, at least in the early going, but the close left a lot to be desired.




The good news about Monday's stock market session? The Dow Jones industrial average scored its 8th straight gain, several [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) names rose 1% or more, and shares of **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) soared nearly 12%.


The bad news? The Nasdaq composite faded an early gain and the Russell 2000 small-cap index reversed lower after hitting an all-time high on an intraday basis.


It certainly wasn't the close the bulls were looking for. After rising nearly 0.8% in the morning, the Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of 0.1%. The Dow added 0.3% and the S&P 500 edged higher by 0.1%. The Russell 2000 shot to an all-time high early, rising nearly 0.5% early. But it reversed lower, falling 0.4%.

Volume on the Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's level. A [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on May 2 fell off the Nasdaq's count Monday due to the strength of the recent advance. But the S&P 500 marked a stalling session due to higher volume, adding another distribution day to its count. A stalling session occurs when an index rises in heavy volume but doesn't make meaningful price progress.


Monday's performance by the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is a reminder that the market can still be tricky even when it's in a confirmed uptrend. There are still plenty of healthy charts out there among leading growth stocks, but it's not prudent at this point to be overly aggressive with new buys. Try a stock or two on for size. If it works, great. But if it doesn't, don't be afraid to cut bait quickly.


Semiconductor Rise Early, Fade
------------------------------


Chip stocks were strong early on reports that [China has resumed its review](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qualcomm-nxp-deal-trump/) of **Qualcomm**'s ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) proposed buyout of NXP Semiconductors for around $44 billion. Shares of Qualcomm added nearly 3%.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gapped up and rose 2.4%, but it ended with a gain of 1.3%.


Former chip-equipment leaders faded badly after early strength. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) ended near session lows.


Among chipmakers, **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) closed in the top half of its intraday range. Shares rose more than 1.2%.


Stock Market Winners: Gaming Stocks
-----------------------------------


Stocks in IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment outperformed after the [Supreme Court paved the way for legalized sports betting in the U.S.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/supreme-court-legalize-sports-betting-casinos/) **Scientific Games** ([SGMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGMS)) jumped out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 55 buy point. Shares soared 11% to 59.30.


**Penn National Gaming** ([PENN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PENN)) cleared a cup-shaped base with a conventional entry at 33.40. Shares gained nearly 5% to 33.75.


**Churchill Downs** ([CHDN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHDN)) also cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 285.80 entry. Shares popped about 5% to 292.60.


China Stocks Outperform
-----------------------


Several China-based names turned in solid showings as fears of a U.S. trade war with China cooled. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) ended with gains of more than 2%.


**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), meanwhile, tried to clear a long consolidation with a conventional entry at 275.07. But gains faded. Shares rose less than 1% to 272.26 in light turnover.


Other breakouts included **Weight Watchers** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)). Shares jumped 5% to 78.76 in heavy volume. It cleared a later-stage, cup-with-handle base with a 76.75 entry.


Separately, the 10-year Treasury bond yield added 3 basis points to 3%, but the move higher didn't help the regional banks much.


The group lost around 0.4%. Top performers in the group like **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) and **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) fell modestly.

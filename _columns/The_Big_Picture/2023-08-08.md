Stock Market Pulls Back In Constructive Session; Stocks To Watch Include Arista Networks, United Rentals
=========================================================================================================

Sellers came into the stock market Tuesday as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite drew closer to key tests of their 50-day moving averages. But buyers lifted both indexes off lows by the close.




Recession fears took center stage again early in the session after economic data out of China showed imports and exports falling much more than expected in July. The data indicated soft demand in China and overseas.


Separately, economic optimism hit a one-year low, according to the latest reading from the August [IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/u-s-economic-optimism-hits-one-year-low-investors-sour-as-sp-500-slides/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped just over 0.4% but closed near its session high and held support at its 21-day exponential moving average; the S&P 500 pared a 1.2% morning loss to just 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite, down as much as 1.6%, closed with a loss of 0.8%.


Volume rose on both exchanges, giving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 another mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Breadth improved as the session wore on, but losers still outnumbered winners on both exchanges by roughly 3-2.


Meanwhile, a Moody's downgrade of several regional banks cast a pall on the financial sector, sending the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) to an intraday loss of 4.5%. To its credit, though, the ETF paid a visit to its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and found support, closing with a loss of 1.3%.


The U.S. dollar rallied again, and money flowed into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield down to a low of 3.98%. But the yield pared losses by the stock market close, down 6 basis points to around 4.2%.


According to the [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) tool, futures traders widely expect the Federal Reserve to keep the federal funds rate steady at 5.25% to 5.50% at the September meeting. Traders expect the Fed to stand pat in November as well, with the chances of another 25-basis-point hike at only 31%.

An [earnings sell-off](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ddog-stock-datadog-earnings-q22023/) for **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) fueled another round of selling in the enterprise software group, which slumped more than 3%. Datadog reported another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth, but revenue growth decelerated from Q1. To make matters worse, DDOG guided Q3 revenue below expectations.


Datadog's weak report weighed on **Teradata** ([TDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDC)), which plunged around 17% and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), which plummeted nearly 7%.


What To Do Now
--------------


It was a resilient performance for the stock market Tuesday, but raising some cash in the portfolio still makes sense. Take a look at your strongest performers and consider taking partial or even full profits. But if your leading stocks are still holding above key support levels, give them room to work by holding on to some shares.

The stock market uptrend is under some pressure, but it's far from dead. Continue to look for buy opportunities when they present themselves, but start small.


Amid a lot of carnage in the technology sector, **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) continues to act well after gapping up last week on earnings. It's been holding gains and trading sideways and is still in buy range from a 178.36 entry.


In the oil drilling group, **Diamond Offshore** ([DO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DO)) made a stand at its 50-day moving average, putting the small cap in a buy zone.



Winners were few and far between, but Denmark-based **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) gapped out of a flat base and soared more than 17%. The company said its [weight-loss drug cut the risk of heart attacks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/novo-nordisk-stock-breaks-out-boosting-lilly-shares-on-a-major-boon-for-weight-loss-drugs/) and other events by 20% in overweight adults in a trial.


**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) soared 15% after reporting earnings. The company's Type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro is currently being looked at by the Food and Drug Administration as a weight-loss treatment. Approval is expected by the end of this year or early next.

SCCO, URI In Buy Zones
----------------------


**Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) paid a visit to its 21-day exponential average before rallying off lows. It closed just above an 82.05 entry.


**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) is still in a buy zone after a low-volume pullback. It's one of 11 stocks currently in the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) model portfolio.


Another Leaderboard stock, **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) soared more than 10% in extended trading after reporting revenue of $326 million, up 112% year over year and well above the Zacks consensus estimate of $281.9 million.

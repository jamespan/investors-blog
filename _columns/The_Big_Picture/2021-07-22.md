  Nasdaq Leads, Small Caps Slide Amid Jump In Jobless Claims; Is Tesla Still A Stock Market Leader?

The stock market ended mostly higher Thursday, but small caps struggled amid a surprise jump in jobless claims. Earnings reports continue to file in, and with Tesla stock reporting next week, is the company a market leader?




Before Thursday's market open, the Labor Department reported a 51,000 increase in initial jobless claims. New filings for unemployment totaled 419,000 last week, sharply above the 350,000 consensus estimate.


Indexes got off to a slow start. But the Nasdaq closed 0.4% higher Thursday, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slid nearly 1.6%.


Leading growth stocks ended with moderate gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.7%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) rallied 3.7% Thursday, extending a win streak to five sessions. The stock is in buy range past a 260.92 buy point.


![MP072221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP072221-261x300.jpg)Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average extended their win streaks to three sessions Thursday. The S&P 500 continues to rebound from the 50-day moving average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is again closing in on record highs.


Despite this week's rebound, the stock market remains in an uptrend under pressure, as the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remains elevated. The S&P 500 now has six distribution days. The June 16 distribution day was removed from the count due to time. Distribution days older than 25 sessions are considered no longer relevant to the current market action. The Nasdaq's count remains at four.

Stock Analysis: Tesla
---------------------


EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) continues to build a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that shows a 700.10 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares declined nearly 1% Thursday, adding to Wednesday's 0.8% loss.


[Tesla](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-is-it-a-buy-now/) is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock. Per Leaderboard analysis, the stock topped a trend-line entry at 675 on July 12. However, the stock is running into difficulty and is below that level. For now, Tesla is holding above its critical 50- and 200-day moving average lines.


The company continues to demonstrate impressive performance despite a [global chip shortage](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-desperate-measures-eyed-for-chip-shortage-gm-supply-crunch-eases/). In early July, Tesla reported deliveries of [201,250 vehicles in the second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-nears-key-support-june-china-ev-sales-data-due/), up from the prior record of 184,800 in the first quarter. Deliveries soared 120% from the year-ago period.


Tesla earnings are due Monday. The company's earnings are expected to soar 114% to 94 cents per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.



While the EV giant's fundamental strength is impressive and it's never smart to bet against CEO Elon Musk, there is a key flaw: a weak [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/). Tesla's RS line remains far from its old highs. A lagging RS line is a sign of an underperforming stock relative to the broad market. Tesla stock remains nearly 30% off its all-time high, even as the major indexes reached record highs last week.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Tesla](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-inc-tsla.aspx) shows a mild 79 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


For now, it's wise to avoid buying the stock, especially in an uptrend under pressure. The looming earnings report is another risk. It's best to focus on growth names that are approaching new highs and breaking out past correct buy points in heavy volume. For example, **XPEL** ([XPEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEL)) broke out Thursday past a 94.31 buy point and is in the 5% buy range that tops out at 99.03. It was [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/xpel-stock-rides-popularity-with-tesla-supercar-owners/) Bullishly, the stock's RS line is at new highs.

Stock Market Earnings: Intel, Snap, Twitter
-------------------------------------------


Dow Jones chip stock **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and social media giants **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) reported their quarterly results after the close Thursday.


Intel [topped Q2 earnings and sales estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-chipmaker-handily-beats-sales-profit-goals/), but the stock fell over 2% in after-hours trade. Shares are nearly 20% off their 52-week high and below their 50-day moving average.


Snap soared over 13% in overnight trade after the Snapchat parent [easily beat the Street's earnings and sales targets.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-soars-on-second-quarter-earnings/) Shares are tracing a cup-with-handle base with a 70.34 buy point. The 18% handle decline is deeper than normal, however.


Twitter stock jumped about 5% in extended trade following the [company's strong Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-jumps-on-second-quarter-earnings-twtr/). The company also issued better-than-expected Q3 sales guidance. The stock is building a [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) base with a handle that offers a 72.17 entry.

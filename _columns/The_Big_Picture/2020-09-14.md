Nasdaq, S&P 500 Grip Key Chart Level As M&A Activity, Coronavirus News Move Stocks
===================================================================================

Just when it seemed the stock market was headed for deeper losses, buyers stepped in Monday to hoist indexes away from further trouble.




The Nasdaq composite climbed back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) after rallying 1.9% Monday, just one session after the composite closed below the 50-day line. The S&P 500 bounced 1.3% after a glancing touch of its own 50-day.


In terms of chart analysis, that was about as good a showing as could be expected following a week of heavy selling. The bounce brought some hope that the stock market will rebound from its sharp tumble.


Also positive was the broad nature of Monday's gains, from the big caps to small caps. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark jumped 2.7% and also bounced off its 50-day line.


![MP091420](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP091420.jpg)Advancing stocks led decliners by a 7-2 ratio on the Nasdaq and by more than 4-to-1 on the NYSE.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, an indication that institutional investors bought into the rebound. Nasdaq volume remained below average, a trend that has persisted since July. Trading tends to slow during the summer months, but typically increases after Labor Day. NYSE volume has been below average for most of the past five months.


The IBD 50 climbed 1.2%, as only five of the 50 stocks closed lower. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) surged 2.1%, nearly erasing all losses from the two prior sessions.


Stock Market Still Under Pressure
---------------------------------


While the signals were mainly positive Monday, the stock market uptrend remains under pressure. Indexes went through a rapid decompression starting Sept. 3 that saw many leading stocks give back large chunks of their summer gains. Some triggered sell signals, including **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)).


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) hardly had time to enjoy its breakout when sellers swarmed Sept. 3-4. Shares Monday spent a second straight day below the 50-day line, so this is one leader to watch carefully.


The put-call volume ratio has not been elevated, despite the Nasdaq's 10% loss over just a few days. The lack of heightened fear suggests the market is not ready to bottom out. The S&P 500 quickly piled up five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which is something to take seriously.


After falling several days with no major catalyst, Monday's stock market moved on a raft of merger and coronavirus news.


**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) and **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) announced [positive early data of their coronavirus treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-rises-good-coronavirus-treatment-data/) when combined with **Gilead Sciences**' ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) remdesivir.


On Saturday, **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) announced plans to increase a final-phase Covid-19 vaccine test to 44,000 participants from 30,000.


Also over the weekend, **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) said U.K. regulators authorized the company to [resume late-stage trials of its coronavirus vaccine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/covid-vaccine-stocks-rise-astrazeneca-resumes-pfizer-expands-trials/). The test was halted Sept. 6 after one participant became ill.


M&A Activity Over The Weekend
-----------------------------


In M&A activity, **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) agreed to acquire biotech **Immunomedics** ([IMMU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMMU)) in a [$21 billion deal](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/gild-stock-rises-covid-19-treatment-provider-announces-largest-acquisition/). **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) on Sunday announced [it will acquire chipmaker Arm](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-rises-deal-to-buy-arm/) from Japan's **SoftBank** ([SFTBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFTBY)) for up to $40 billion in cash and stock.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) said TikTok's parent company rejected its buyout offer, leaving **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) as the leading bidder for the video app's U.S. operations. And **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) agreed Monday to [buy prepaid wireless service provider Tracfone](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-stock-rises-acquire-tracfone-america-movil-branch/) from **America Movil** ([AMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMX)) for $6.25 billion in cash and stock.


A bullish mood on Wall Street led to breakouts in gold and gaming shares, among others.


An Emerging Stock Market Leader In Entertainment
------------------------------------------------



**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) broke out after it inked a deal with **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), sending the stock well above the 44.89 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its four-month [cup-style base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/). The fantasy sports and betting platform will become a sportsbook link-out provider and exclusive daily fantasy sports outlet for Disney, which owns ESPN.


DraftKings is the leader in the gaming industry group, and the main reason why [the group has shot up to the top 10 of 197 groups](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/casino-stocks-suddenly-get-hot-here-are-ones-to-watch/).


**Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) broke out past the 84.76 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/), and closed extended from that level. The breakout landed Agnico on [IBD Leaderboard.](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint)

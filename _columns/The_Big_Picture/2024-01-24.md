  Stock Market Finishes Mixed As Netflix Soars, But S&P 500 Makes This Rare Move

[Stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) in the stock market usually doesn't happen often. But if you've been investing for a long time, you've likely learned to expect the unexpected, right?




The S&P 500 scored its fifth straight gain on Wednesday. That's what you'd expect for a [stock market in a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/), which began on Nov. 1. It's also what you prefer to see if you agree with IBD's suggestion right now that 80% to 100% of your capital devoted toward stocks should get deployed.


However, both Monday's and Wednesday's trading sessions fit the very definition of a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/). That is, the action hinted at institutional players taking advantage of an intraday rally to sell into strength and take profits off the table.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Monday, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6% but finished the day up only 0.2%. And on Wednesday, an early 0.8% advance petered out. The large-cap benchmark closed up only 3.95 points at 4868, or less than 0.1%.


Volume grew on the NYSE vs. the prior session on both days. Hence, combined with the rally in prior days, these two sessions met the classic definition of this rare form of distribution.



Reports of a sour auction of U.S. Treasury five-year bonds may have spoiled Wednesday's rally. The yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note rose for the sixth time in seven sessions, up three-100ths of a percentage point to 4.17%, according to Cboe data.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP012424-198x300.jpg)That didn't change the fact that the cost of borrowing money in the long term is at the highest level in six weeks. However, go to a daily chart of the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield (zero-TNX at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF)), and the two-month downtrend in yields has clearly broken.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased less than 0.3%, but the Dow Jones transportation average slipped 0.9%.


Within the 30-stock Dow industrials, gains of 1 point or more by five members, including energy giant **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), offset losses of 2 points or more by six other Dow stocks. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) fell the most on a point basis, down 4.41 points or 1.4% to 305.50 in light turnover.


Amgen sports the seventh-highest [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) within the Dow industrials at 82. The biotech giant has exceeded the 5% buy zone after clearing a cup base with a 288.46 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on the first trading day of the year.


Stalling Vs. Distribution
-------------------------


Does a bull run in the stock market die of stalling days? IBD research says absolutely not. Outright heavy selling across the board and big drops in the S&P 500 and other key averages matter more.


Within the S&P 500, a [true distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) took place on Dec. 20. The benchmark lost 1.5% and closed at 4698. NYSE turnover rose vs. the prior session and tipped above its 50-day average. But now that distribution day looks vulnerable to falling off the rolling 25-session count, either on time or on a 5% rally from that day's closing price.


On the other side of the stock market fence, the Nasdaq did just that.



The composite index on Wednesday gained enough ground to snuff out a pair of distribution days, both Dec. 20 and Jan. 2. Therefore, as noted in the accompanying Market Pulse table, the distribution-day count got chopped to a single day. Namely, the 0.6% decline in higher volume on Dec. 29 remains.


The Nasdaq would have to hit 15,761.92 to extinguish the sole remaining distribution day off the count.


Nonetheless, a daily chart of the premier gauge of high-growth companies in the stock market also carried the scent of stalling, even if Wednesday's session didn't count as such. Why? Volume on the all-electronic exchange fell 4% vs. Tuesday to 4.98 billion shares.


Among other important stock market indexes, the S&P SmallCap 600 reversed from initial gains for a second straight session. On Wednesday, the S&P 600 fell 0.7%. It still retains a thick cushion above its fast-climbing [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


The Russell 2000 slumped 0.7%. At 1961, the index is down 3.2% year-to-date after rallying 15.1% in 2023.

Earnings Dynamics
-----------------


Let's view components of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), a good weather vane of high-growth companies in the stock market. You might have noticed that volume is starting to pick up within IBD 50 companies.


As seen in [Leaderboard's showcase of the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), at least eight names saw volume jump at least 50% above usual levels. However, a small majority of the IBD 50 stocks finished trading with below-average volume.



**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which soared 10.7% in volume that rocketed 528% above its 50-day average, and education firm **Stride** ([LRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRN)), which was down 2% in heavy trading after rising as much as 12% in the first 15 minutes of the session, underscored just how challenging it can be to start a new position right ahead of quarterly results.


The earnings-related volatility always serves as a reminder to make sure 1) to buy at a correct entry point and 2) to keep a good profit cushion in a stock ahead of results, say around 5% to 10%, but depending on the normal action of the stock. Neither Netflix nor Stride made the IBD 50 as of Wednesday.


The IBD 50 index, by the way, headed into Wednesday's session with a 4.9% gain for the month. That's quite a healthy advance, especially after the index rallied as much as 24% from its Oct. 27 low during the fourth quarter of 2023.


Stock Market Psychology
-----------------------


Bullishness among newsletter editors rebounded to 52.9% vs. 48.5% a week earlier, according to Investors Intelligence's weekly survey. That still falls shy of a near-term peak of 57.1% seen both in early December and at the start of 2024.


The ratio of bearish pundits fell to 17.1% vs. 19.1%. Editors at Investors Intelligence noted that "low levels of bears (near 18% in July/August 2023, just 15.3% in July 2021) hint at tops."

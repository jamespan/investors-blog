U.S. stock indexes rose Friday, concluding a five-day sweep for the bulls.


The Nasdaq popped 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.


Volume fellÂ on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The major indexes rose each day of the week. The only red mark was a stalling-type of distribution day Monday on the Dow.

Since the Election Day's close, the Dow has been outperforming the Nasdaq and S&P 500. And three Dow stocks are outperforming the market-leading small-cap S&P 600. The small-cap index is up 18% in the Trump rally while **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) are up 36%, 33% and 22%.


The Nasdaq, with six distribution days, remains the market's chief worry. After strong gains, the indexes may be due for a pullback.


Economic news Friday pasted a bullish note on the market outlook. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence gauge surged to 98, far above the prior reading of 93.8 and a 12-year high.


While bullish, the strong number wasn't a surprise. On Tuesday, IBD-TIPP released its [Economic Optimism Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/economic-optimism-hits-10-year-high-on-trump-but-democrats-are-blue/), hitting a 10-year high. Confidence is a key element in a healthy economy and indirectly contributes to stock market success.


On Friday, the stock indexes showed confidence. Not only did the major indexes notch gains each day of the week, but the closes were bullishly high in each day's range. Those high closes point to funds that are reluctant to sell into the rally.


However, some secondary indicators are pointing to a top. Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears ratio is flashing danger signals. And the percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day line was 65% going into Friday's session, an elevated number.


Yet, new highs are growing and spreading to other sectors. And the put/call volume ratio isn't setting off alarms yet.


**What's ahead:** The Federal Reserve will conduct a two-day meeting beginning Tuesday. An interest rate hike is expected.


On Wednesday, retail sales for November will be released as well as industrial production for November and business inventories for October.

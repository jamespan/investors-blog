Nasdaq Leads Market Lower As Chip News Triggers Selling
========================================================

Stocks started on separate paths Friday, as the S&P 500 rose and the Nasdaq fell, but by the close both indexes were in the red.


The Nasdaq axed off 2.3%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.1%. The IBD 50 severed 2.9%.


Volume rose across the board.


The difference for the indexes was tied to the slaughter in semiconductor stocks, most of which are listed on the Nasdaq.


Chipmakers and designers sold off hard after a disappointing sales outlook from **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)).


CEO Steve Sanghi in a news release said September is typically a strong month for revenue but this year "September sales did not materialize." (See story on Page A1.)


The Arizona-based midcap is only a fraction of the size of an **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) or a **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), but Microchip is regarded as an early indicator for the sector because of its 80,000 customers.


Sanghi said he believes "another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future."


Both the chipmaker and the chip designer industry groups gapped down.


Semiconductors are cyclical but have impact on the rest of the market. Since at least 2009, the Nasdaq has moved in the same direction as the two chip industry groups. The proportions of the price moves, however, can differ.


For example, the last bear market for chip stocks was a two-wave decline that ran from mid-February 2011 to mid-November 2012.


Chipmakers dived 36%, while the Nasdaq rose 1%. That might sound like weak linkage. Tucked within that period, though, was a five-month 20% decline in the Nasdaq in 2011.


The sell-off in chips added to other worries.


Earlier in the week, the IMF downgraded its global growth forecast for 2014 and 2015. And fears of a recession in the eurozone — it would be the third since 2009 — grew after Germany reported that exports plunged 5.8% in August.


A recession in Europe might seem like a big problem for the stock market. But the eurozone's last recession — which began in Q3 2011 and ended in Q2 2013 — didn't derail the Nasdaq. The U.S. index gained 41% during the eurozone recession.


Yet, that statistic is misleading in one sense. The early part of the eurozone's recession coincided with the Nasdaq's last 20% decline. And that broadly coincided with the chip sector's last bear market.


For IBD-style investors, who are presumably mostly in cash by now, a deep correction might be a good thing. Cash on the sidelines makes patience enjoyable. And a correction that shakes out weak holders can allow fundamentally strong stocks to set up for the next uptrend.


There's no guarantee, though, that things will play out neatly. A volatile market can swing both ways. Earnings season will step up in the coming week with heavyweights from the financial, chip, transportation and Internet sectors reporting.


For the week, the IBD 50 plunged 7%, the Nasdaq 4.5% and the S&P 500 3.1%. Blue chips did best: The Dow lost 2.7%.


The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.16 Friday, a level that previously coincided with market bottoms. This time, the ratio topped 1.1 on Oct. 1, but the indexes have made new lows since then.

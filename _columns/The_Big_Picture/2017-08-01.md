Dow Leads Stocks And Gets Apple Boost, But Is That A Bad Thing?
================================================================

The Dow Jones industrial average led the market again Tuesday, extending its win streak to six days. It got more fuel late in the day, when **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) beat profit expectations and rose 5% after hours.




The industrials, which are nearing the 22,000 mark, made a record high after rising 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.2% as well. But the Dow transports continued a weakening trend, slipping 0.4%. Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq.


Some investors fear that when the Dow outperforms, it's a bad sign for the broad market. But the current divergence is mild so far. Plus, the Dow has actually not posed as a topping signal during the corrections of the bull market that began in 2009: The Dow was more or less in step with the Nasdaq before the corrections of 2010, 2011 and 2015.


More importantly, the number of [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) is normal.


The Dow's leadership is not so much a mass move by corporate giants, as it is earnings-related rallies for many of the 30 components. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) soared 10% last Wednesday, **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) 8% on Thursday, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) 6% and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) 5% a week ago, and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) 11% on June 30. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) has climbed more than 4% since it announced Q2 results Friday, while a weeklong rally in oil prices has aided the broad oil sector.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP080117.png)Longer term, the Nasdaq continues to boast the better performance: It's up 18.2% this year compared with 11.1% for the Dow. The composite also is up 26% from the November lows, vs. 23% for the Dow.


The Nasdaq has been in an upward price channel going back to November. While it's stayed within the borders of that channel, some sudden sell-offs have interrupted the climb, if only momentarily. It's almost as if the Nasdaq is demanding investors pay a toll to stay on its high-speedÂ road.


This year's intense drops on March 21, May 17, June 9 and (to a lesser extent) June 27 and 29 did not result in much further deterioration. Even after the June 9 tumble, the market went sideways for four weeks and got its footing back. The next month, the Nasdaq rose 13 of 14 days in July to reach new highs.


The market has shrugged off political and geopolitical turmoil, whether the crisis is Russia, North Korea, the West Wing or stock valuations.


Instead, Wall Street seems focused on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and quarterly earnings. The Fed has given some guidance on its intentions, and earnings season has gone smoothly so far.


As of Friday, 57% of the companies in the S&P 500 had reported quarterly results. Of those, 73% have beaten EPS estimates compared to the five-year average of 68%. In whole, companies' profits are 6.4% higher than estimates, which is also above the five-year average, according to research from FactSet.


Moreover, 73% also have topped sales estimates while 27% have missed. That's running well above the trailing one-year average (56%) and the trailing and five-year average (53%) of sales beats. If the trend holds, FactSet says it will be the highest percentage since the firm started tracking the data in Q3 of 2008.


Companies are also beating revenue estimates by wider margins than average. Aggregate sales are 1.2% above expectations. That's better than the trailing one-year average and five-year averages, both of 0.5%.


The positive profit reports continued after the close Tuesday, when Apple beat profit and sales expectations. Shares rose 4.5% in extended trading as the Dow component and largest Nasdaq stock seemed poised to break out past a 156.75 buy point.


The company certainly is no fresh face. But a long consolidation from May 2015 to early this year served to reset the chart and give the stock a chance to rise some more.


Of course, that doesn't mean the risk of earnings report isn't gone. On Tuesday, **Idexx Labs** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) plunged 7% in heavy volume even after the veterinary products company beat profit and sales expectations.


Building products supplier **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) tumbled after it missed profit expectations, and **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)), a peer that reports results Wednesday, fell in sympathy. **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) lost nearly 3%.

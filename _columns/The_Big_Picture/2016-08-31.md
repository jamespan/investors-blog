The stock market closed the month with soft losses Wednesday as volume picked up.


All in all, August proved to be a month where the real drama seemed to take place in Brazil, courtesy of folks like Olympian Ryan Lochte and ousted Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, not on Wall Street.


The S&P 500 slipped slightly more than 0.2%, while the Nasdaq edged slightly less than 0.2%. Volume picked up sharply, perhaps in part due to window dressing by portfolio managers and last-minute profit-taking ahead of the new trading month. The S&P 500 now has six distribution days, or sessions of intense professional selling.

The Dow utilities, watched as a sign of investor defensiveness, rose nearly 0.3%. However, don't be fooled by that gain. This index perhaps proved nightmarish for some investors, falling 6.3% for the month and matching the nearly 6.3% fall suffered in June 2015.


The Nasdaq gained 1% in August; the S&P 500 was down just 0.1%. Brazil's Bovespa benchmark enjoyed a 2.2% gain.

As IBD has reported over the years, a **[distribution-day count](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764)** of five to six can be enough to kill a bull market. So, is it time to call its demise?


Many technicians and talking heads would certainly like to do so. After all, we are in Year Eight of the mighty bull since stocks bottomed out in March 2009. Sure, the 20% correction in 2011 arguably may have reset the bull clock, but it would be natural for anyone to believe that a bear market is not far from the horizon.


However, even in the case of distribution, quality — not just quantity — counts. Looking at the six distribution days on the S&P 500, the largest decline was a 0.6% drop on Aug. 2. The average loss among the five down days? A mild 0.4%. (One distribution was a stalling session.)


For this reason, as one can see on the S&P's daily chart, the overall decline from the all-time high of 2193 set on Aug. 15 has been feather-light. At Wednesday's low of 2161, the overall drop has been limited to 1.5%.


What are some other reasons to view the "heavy" distribution count with a healthy grain of salt?


One, more stocks continue to hit new highs than make new lows. Lately, the banking sector has beefed up the list. With the possibility of another hike in short-term interest rates sometime during the rest of the year, a rotation of money back into financial stocks would help prolong the market's advance.


Two, other technicals point to decent market strength. The S&P 500 has dipped closer to its key 50-day moving average, but for now it's still above the support line. The Nasdaq composite has an even larger cushion of gains. Ditto for the Russell 2000.


How about the Dow utilities? Nope. On Aug. 5, the index clipped its 50-day line. Since then, sellers have simply piled on. Over the same time period, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has held steady, but at 1.59% it's still sharply above its July low near 1.37%.


Finally, as IBD's market columns such as **[Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders)**, **[IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/)**, Industry Themes and **[The Income Investor](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/)** show, the market is seeing strength in numerous sectors. You can browse these columns by going to "Research" or "Stock Lists" on the home page of Investors.com. Check out today's **[New Highs](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/)** column, which highlights some stealth strength among some Indian stocks as well. Big cap plays **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) and **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)) hit 52-week highs Wednesday.

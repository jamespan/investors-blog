Nasdaq Reclaims 50-Day Line; Small Caps Rule The Roost
=======================================================

Small caps outperformed again Monday, the Nasdaq reclaimed its 50-day moving average and the Dow hit another all-time high as the week started off on a positive note.


It didn't look too good Sunday afternoon. Stocks futures initially traded lower, the dollar jumped and the euro plunged after Italian voters rejected a plan from Prime Minister Matteo Renzi that promised to streamline the country's government. But all that flip-flopped Monday as developments in Italy went to the back burner.


After two straight closes below the 50-day moving average, the Nasdaq popped 1%. Volume on the Nasdaq fell slightly from Friday's level, but it was still a solid showing for the tech index, which still carries a high distribution day count. It's a laggard index for now, as bellwether names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) struggle to attract buyers.


![mp_mixed_120516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP_mixed_120516.png)The S&P 500 added 0.6%, the Dow picked up 0.2%. Small caps did well again as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.8%. The IBD 50 added 1.3%. Volume on the NYSE came in slightly higher than Friday.


IBD's market outlook was lowered a notch last week to "uptrend under pressure" when the Nasdaq fell below the 50-day line Thursday in heavy volume. The same day, the Philadelphia semiconductor index paid a visit to its 50-day line but closed just above it. It bounced off the line Friday and extended gains Monday. The message? Don't declare the chip sector dead just yet.


IBD 50 chip names **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) outperformed Monday with gains of 4% each.


The Nasdaq's 2.6% decline last week in higher volume was a stark reminder that institutional sellers are still around. The market uptrend is still intact, but the risk level remains elevated amid a still-challenging environment for growth stocks. It remains OK to look for stocks to buy, just be careful not to buy stocks that have run a lot already and are extended.


When it comes to the other stock indexes, the Russell 2000 small-cap index is holding near highs above the 1300 level, and the S&P 500 looks just fine, buoyed by strength in oil and gas, financial and infrastructure plays. Among aggregate makers, **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) is holding gains smartly.


Oil and gas stocks also outperformed, with equipment makers and drillers leading the charge. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude oil futures edged 0.2% to $51.79 a barrel.


Headed into Monday, IBD's machinery/equipment group ranked 11th in IBD's 197 industry group rankings based on six-month price performance, but fundamentals are hazy in the group. Keeping that in mind, **Now** ([DNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNOW)) and **National Oilwell Varco** ([NOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOV)) are still in buy zones after  fresh breakouts.


The Nasdaq's strength Monday was good for IBD 50 stocks, as nearly a third of the names in the index rose 2% or more.


Component **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) was in rally mode again ahead of Tuesday's earnings report. Shares rose 2.7% to 48.83. It's close to the top of a buy range, about 4% past a 46.94 buy point.


Meanwhile, while most financials are extended in the IBD 50, **BofI Holding** ([BOFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOFI)) is still in buy range from a 23.94 buy point, but the San Diego-based bank is on the speculative side, with a market capitalization of around $1.5 million. But fundamentals look good, and the stock is plenty liquid, with an average daily volume north of 1 million shares.

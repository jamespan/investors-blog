The major stock indexes added to Wednesday's bullish gains, as the new stock market uptrend gained some traction Thursday. Up next, investors will shift their attention to Friday's inflation data, with the release of the PCE price index.




With the new uptrend in place, there are a number of leading stocks that are flashing buy signals and moving higher, including [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) and software leader **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)).


Economic Data, Earnings
-----------------------


Early Friday, the Commerce Department's personal income and outlays report is due out. Personal income is expected to rise 0.3% in February with consumption expenditures up 0.2%, according to Econoday estimates. The overall PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index is expected to rise 0.4% on the month, with an annual rate of 5.1%. Wall Street expects core prices, minus food and energy, to rise 0.4% on the month, with an annual core inflation rate of 4.7%.


Early Thursday, initial unemployment claims climbed to 198,000, topping Wall Street expectations for a rise to 195,000 vs. 191,000 in the previous week. Meanwhile, the final estimate of fourth-quarter GDP came in at 2.6%, below estimates for it to match the previous reading of 2.7%.


It was a mostly quiet day on the earnings front, butÂ medical leader **Neogen** ([NEOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEOG)) and retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) were on the move Thursday.


Neogen shares declined 5.6% Thursday, while RH stock dropped more than 3% after the company's earnings and sales numbers missed estimates.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP033023_2-287x300.jpg)On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 0.4%, and the S&P 500 climbed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7%, closing above 12,000 and at its highest level since Feb. 15. The small-cap Russell 2000 was a laggard, falling 0.2%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and edged lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.3%, closing just above its 50-day moving average. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)) advanced 2.7%, closing within striking distance of a 196.51 buy point in a base-on-base formation.


[Wednesday's bullish gains](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-leads-bullish-turn-in-stock-market-but-still-must-clear-these-potential-pitfalls/) shifted IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) into a "confirmed uptrend," and investors should be looking for opportunities to raise their market exposure. An exposure level between 20%-40% makes sense in the immediate aftermath of a follow-through day.


The follow-through gives investors the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but remember to increase your exposure gradually and methodically. As breakouts gain momentum and your portfolio makes progress, you should feel comfortable increasing your exposure.


Conversely, if your breakouts falter and your portfolio makes little to no progress, then it doesn't make sense to commit more capital. The market still faces significant hurdles with inflation, banking woes and other issues.

Stock Market Edges Higher, But Nasdaq Fades Late; Dow Stock Makes Bullish Move
===============================================================================

Wednesday's session served up more record highs for the Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 faded late, closing in the bottom half of their intraday ranges. The stock market was in a good mood early, with indexes up 0.5% to 0.6%, after the U.S. officially inked a phase-one trade deal with China.




As part of the deal, China pledged more protection for U.S. intellectual property. It also said it will stop requiring U.S. firms to share their technology as a cost of doing business in China. But U.S. tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese goods will stay in place until a phase-two deal is reached.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index made a new high, rising 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.3%, and the Nasdaq inched up 0.1%. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Tuesday, but it's a close call on the NYSE. If NYSE volume ends up higher, it would amount to a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the S&P 500.

Semiconductor stocks lagged, with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) down 1.5%, but the true leaders in the sector like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) continue to hold near highs and above their 10-day moving averages.


Homebuilder Strength
--------------------


The late-session selling in the stock market didn't impede breakouts from a couple of homebuilder ETFs. Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull ([NAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NAIL)) jumped more than 5% to 79.63. It's [still in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) from a 77.71 entry. IShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) picked up 1.7% to 46.83. It's also still in buy range from a 46.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Among individual homebuilding stocks, **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) has emerged as a leader in the group. It's been following through nicely after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) at 41.80. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), meanwhile, is still in buy range after a breakout from a shallow [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 60.79 buy point.


While the stock market is showing some signs it could be ready for a pullback, the fact that everyone seems to be calling for one means the confirmed uptrend could have more left. Until meaningful sell signals start to appear in the charts of leading growth stocks, there's no reason to adopt an overly bearish stance. It takes persistent signs of distribution in the indexes — and equally persistent selling in leading growth stocks — for a stock market rally to run into trouble.



The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to hold comfortably above their 10-week moving averages but aren't stretched by any means. The Nasdaq is 5% above its 10-week line. The S&P 500 is only 3% above the key support level.


Meanwhile, signs of meaningful institutional selling in the indexes just aren't there, with a very light [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) currently for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


For now, the stock market is focused on fourth-quarter earnings season, with earnings reports due Thursday from the likes of **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and railroad operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)).

Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Former retail leader **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) flashed a sell signal with a violent drop below its 50-day moving average. Target reported a 1.4% jump in holiday same-store sales, but that was well below growth of 5.7% in the year-ago period. For Q4, it forecast same-store sales growth of 1.4%, below a prior projection of 3% to 4% growth.



In earnings news, Dow Jones stock **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) bounced bullishly off its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) for the first time after a breakout from a consolidation in November. A strong earnings report was the catalyst. UnitedHealth joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Wednesday afternoon.


It's always good to see strong breadth in an industry group, and it's there in spades in the managed care group. **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) and **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) were other top performers in the group Wednesday.


IBD's aerospace/defense group is home to some bullish charts. The daily charts of **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) and **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) show [cup-with-handle bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), but lagging [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) are worth noting.

U.S. stock indexes stumbled into trouble Thursday, then regained their balance to finish slightly up for the day.


The Nasdaq and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average ended a tiny bit above flat, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.4%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume also climbed, according to preliminary data.

For the past five sessions, neither the bulls nor the bears have been able to move the market much. The market appears to be in a holding pattern.


Those looking for pivotal factors in this market might find it in three areas.


Crude oil: The decline in the price of oil is clearly shaking up the oil stocks. The price of light sweet crude is 8% off its 52-week high. On Thursday, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil closed below $50 a barrel for the first time in three months. Among the 10 oil-related groups in the oil patch, the oil drillers group is worst at 25% off its high. The pipeline group is holding up best at 5% off its high.


Although the market has been in this situation before, there isn't much buzz this time about lower gasoline prices acting like a tax cut and lifting consumer spending. That didn't happen last time, and it seems like a long shot this time.


Analysts expect gasoline prices to rise in the coming months, partly because the summer driving season is approaching.


Infrastructure spending: Hopes have been hung on an infrastructure boost with little to show so far. On Thursday, cement and wallboard play **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) sliced 5% lower in heavy volume. There was no news to explain the move.


The cement group has been sagging since hitting a 52-week high in January. On Thursday, Eagle scored the cement group's biggest loss. Rival **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) shed 2%, but **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) was nearly flat.


Despite the pullback in infrastructure plays, cement stocks have been attracting some quality fund support. [Will Danoff's](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/fidelitys-will-danoff-talks-about-the-super-bowl-and-super-stocks/) Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)) bought Eagle shares in Q4 and added to Contrafund's position in Vulcan in the same quarter.


The noise and speculation surrounding cement stocks is that the bullish news is priced in. But quality fund support suggests there might be bullish surprises ahead.


Banks and chips: The bank and chip sectors have stayed at or near the top 33 sectors since November. Neither seems ready to give up their leadership position. On Thursday, the superregional banks and money centers held firmly. The same was true of the chip stocks.


Economic news Thursday was mixed. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a decline in job cuts. But first-time jobless claims rose more than expected.


On Friday, the nonfarm payrolls number will be released before the stock market opens. The Street's consensus number is for 200,000 jobs added in February. The range of estimates runs from 162,000 to 240,000.

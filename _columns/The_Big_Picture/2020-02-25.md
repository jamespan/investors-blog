The story of how pasta was born in Italy isn't 100% clear. Some historians think that hundreds of years ago, the concept of noodles from China slowly trekked their way across the Eurasian continent.




Fast-forward to today. No one would dispute that the transmission of coronavirus from the Middle Kingdom to one of the biggest engines of the European Union took far less time. And the news of Italian deaths caused by the new illness is confirming the seriousness of the health crisis.


Fear that the exponential increase of Covid-19 cases over the past week in Italy is going to whip the country's tourism-dependent economy triggered a landslide of selling in stock markets across multiple continents. On Tuesday, the sell-offs ranged from a 2.8% drop in the Nasdaq composite to a 3% shellacking of the S&P 500. The Russell 2000 sold off nearly 3.5%. The small-cap S&P 600 got bludgeoned 3.4%. Like the Russell 2000, it sliced below the 200-day moving average.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sliced further below its key 50-day moving average in a 3.4% sell-off in heavy turnover. The [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) soured to a negative D-, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-inc-aapl.aspx). The iPhone giant's gain from a 221.47 [flat-base buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) now stands at 30%.


The iShares MSCI Italy ([EWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWI)) ETF fell 2.2% on Tuesday. But over the past four sessions, the exchange traded fund has plunged 9.7%.



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP022520-212x300.jpg)Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. the prior session. Judging by the immense number of true market leaders that slid hard in heavy volume, institutions unequivocally locked in recent gains.


A New Pattern Of Institutional Selling
--------------------------------------


Overall, the four-day sell-off is this year's first example of a vertical violation. IBD has identified this as another characteristic of brutal institutional selling.


For the Nasdaq itself, a sharp decline of at least 3% in at least one of the recent sessions, plus a stab below the 50-day moving average (drawn in red in all [IBD charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) and on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF)), help define the vertical violation.


Therefore, just one day after IBD downgraded the current outlook for stocks to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend" after the S&P 500 logged its [sixth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) in the past five weeks, the outlook took another step down to "market in correction."


What To Do Right Now
--------------------


No one knows how far will equities correct.


Yet this phase of the market gives IBD readers a clear-as-a-cow-bell signal that now is the time to raise cash quickly, avoid new buys on breakouts or pullbacks to the 10-week moving average, and assemble a sturdy watch list of true market leaders.


Over the coming days, you'll probably see major changes within the key stock lists, including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/). Or you might not. Indeed, some sectors may actually stay atop the [IBD stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-25-2020/) as they fall less than their counterparts. The tables, found in [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), shuffle the order of stocks based on the strength of their sectors each day after the market close.


Right now, [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) shows a big heap of software, fintech, medical and precious metals plays.


As you assess the strength of a stock, consider measuring how far it's fallen from the 52-week high, then compare that with the major indexes.


Normally, big growth stocks fall 1.5 to 2.5 times as much as the correction by the Nasdaq (which traded nearly 9% below its 9782 all-time peak at Tuesday's session low) and the S&P 500 (down as much as 7.7%). So, don't be surprised by names such as the ones listed in the Market Pulse that fall 12% to 20% or more from their all-time highs.


Such drops would give an opportunity for the long-term leaders on Wall Street to develop [bullish bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Stock Market Today: Fear Spike
------------------------------


The Cboe market volatility index, or the VIX, soared as much as 77% over the past two sessions to as high as 30.25. That marks the highest levels since a bear market swiftly clawed equities in the fourth quarter of 2018.


Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio also rose sharply, but preliminary data showed it fell short of a critical level of 1.15 that has signaled market lows in the past.


Beyond The Correction: Bullishness Is Still Tame
------------------------------------------------


Elsewhere, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) recently reported that a survey of 1,100 retail clients in December 2019 found 33% "are bullish on the stock market for 2020," up from 27% in Q4 2018.


This implies that at that time, two-thirds still held a neutral or bearish view toward equities.


"Attitudinal measures of bullishness are certainly different from popular investment sentiment indicators that we track," Liz Ann Sonders, Schwab's chief investment strategist, told IBD in a phone interview. She added that figure came before the first wave of coronavirus news out of China hit stocks. "This is unique in this cycle of the market. It doesn't take much of a drop in the stock market to create a correction in optimism."


This relatively tame level of investor optimism may ultimately help drive U.S. stocks back to new highs.


The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond plummeted 5 basis points to 1.33%, down 55 basis points from 1.88% at the start of 2020. Two-year notes yield 1.2%.

Stocks fired up, then flamed out, and then found a second up-stage Thursday, reacting to European news that ultimately created only uncertainty.


The Nasdaq ended down 0.3%, after being up almost 1% and down 1.4%. The S&P 500 finished a fraction above break-even. Volume rose on both major exchanges.


The IBD 50 slipped 0.4%.


![MP031116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP031116-191x300.jpg)News gave the market an early boost. First-time jobless claims were about 5% fewer than expected. The big headline news, however, came from Europe.


The European Central Bank cut interest rates further below zero and increased quantitative easing, which the bulls hailed. Later, in a press conference, ECB President Mario Draghi downplayed the likelihood of further rate cuts, which undid the optimism.


Had Draghi kept his mouth shut, Thursday might’ve been a clear up day. However, an uptrend that relies on silence from central bankers is probably missing something crucial.


Technically, the loss in higher volume was enough to slap the Nasdaq with distribution.


However, the Nasdaq needed little to qualify as rising volume. The previous session’s volume was the lowest on the Nasdaq in the year to date.


Top-rated stocks told an equally weak story on volume.


* Only one stock in the IBD 50 moved in volume 40% or more above average, an increase large enough to indicate institutional participation.
* In the S&P 500, only two stocks moved in volume at least 40% above average.
* In the Nasdaq, only one stock upshifted to volume at least 40% above average.


Given those realities, it’s hard to see Thursday’s action as classic distribution. Yet, it nonetheless counts.


A few stocks broke out Thursday.


**Express** ([EXPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPR)) popped 0.79 to 20.45 in volume 180% above average. The stock closed above an entry at 20.01. The small-cap retailer targets the trendy, under-30 crowd.


**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) gapped up 8.02 to 83.23 in volume 250% above average. A gap up involves an opening price that is higher than the previous session’s entire range. It is an exceptionally bullish sign.


**CSG Systems** ([CSGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSGS)) broke out Wednesday with a 6% pop but undid the breakout with an 11% plunge Thursday.


CSG  might well serve as the poster child for this uptrend. In this market, the only certainty is uncertainty.

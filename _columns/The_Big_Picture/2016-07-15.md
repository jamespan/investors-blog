Stock Indexes Step Back; Will Bulls Resume Their Run?
======================================================

Stocks chalked up a third consecutive week of gains, as the indexes strolled to a quiet finish Friday.


The Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 each eased 0.1%.


Volume slipped on both major exchanges. Advancing issues, though, led declining issues by a 6-5 ratio on both main exchanges.


News from China, before the U.S. stock market's open, was positive. GDP grew 6.7% in Q2 vs. the year-ago period. Analysts expected 6.6%, and China's government had projected 6.5%, according to Bloomberg News.

Other gauges in China were impressive in June: Retail sales leapt 10.6% vs. a year ago; and industrial production rose 6.2%.


U.S. stocks, however, didn't react much. The major indexes posted small losses. Perhaps the losses were anticipated, considering the indexes -- going into Friday's session -- had risen in six of the previous seven sessions.


Since nothing goes straight up forever, bulls were most likely content with Friday's action. A pullback would not be surprising at this juncture, though a dozing bull might be more likely than a return of the bear.


The uptrend that began June 28, and was confirmed with a rare three-day follow-through June 30, has not suffered much institutional selling.


While breakouts have not been widespread, there's no shortage of quality stocks outperforming the market. For individual investors holding quality stocks, the current rally has been generous.


Among stocks in the IBD 50 on June 27, when the indexes closed at a short-term low, many have outperformed the indexes. The major indexes are up 8% to 10% since the June 27 close.


Of the stocks in the IBD 50 on June 27, 20 have since outperformed. And 11 have risen 15% to 22% in those three weeks.


A breakdown of the outperformers shows that six of the 20 stocks are in the building sector. However, they only include one homebuilder -- **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)). **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), the biggest stock in the group by market cap, will report quarterly results Thursday. A decisive beat from Horton might help the group.


In economic news, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey delivered unexpectedly bad results. The July gauge came in at 0.55, below the consensus number of 5.0 and under the lowest estimate in the range. Considering the range ran from 2.0 to 10.2, this was an awful miss.


For the week, the S&P SmallCap 600 rose 2.5%; the Nasdaq and S&P 500, 1.5%; and the IBD 50, 0.6%.

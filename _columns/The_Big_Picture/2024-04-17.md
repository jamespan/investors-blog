  Stock Market Rocked By ASML Earnings Fiasco; Why Breadth On NYSE Was Better Than Nasdaq's

The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) fired another loud warning shot across the bow for growth investors. Wednesday's earnings-fueled decline placed the market outlook on the tipping point for a potential new downgrade.




With earnings news revving into higher gear, it's clear that institutions have sought to downshift their positions in a variety of sectors — from semiconductors to software to housing. No wonder, then, that the Nasdaq composite dropped nearly 1.2%, double the 0.6% decline seen by the S&P 500.


Small caps fell significantly, with the Russell 2000 off 1% and the S&P MidCap 400 down 0.8%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average escaped a big sell-off, down 0.1% as at least six of its 30 components rose 1 point or more. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), in [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), made a big impact with a 10-point gain in the price-weighted index. The health insurer, however, got rejected at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Nasdaq Barely Misses A Distribution Day
---------------------------------------


Volume edged lower by just 10 million shares on the Nasdaq vs. the prior day to 4.99 billion shares. NYSE turnover shrank by more than 10%. But as the Market Pulse clearly shows, [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) have already vaulted to a high level. Meanwhile, regular readers of this column have known for weeks that stock market risk was already rising sharply.


Therefore, cash has become a more important position in the portfolio lately.


Investors bought back long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds, sending the yield down 7 basis points to 4.58%. Crude oil futures fell nearly 3% to $82.86 a barrel.

Stock Market Today: Caution Still Highly Warranted
--------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP041724_2-230x300.jpg)Let's review the key changes in IBD's current outlook:


Nov. 1, 2023: A Nasdaq Day 4 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/) results in new confirmed uptrend.


Jan. 3, 2024: Distribution day count goes to 3 on Nasdaq; exposure trimmed to 60%-80% from 80%-100%.


Jan. 8: Exposure boosted back to 80%-100%.


Jan. 25: Stalling-like stock market action. Reduce to 60%-80%.


Feb. 2: Exposure goes back up to 80%-100%.


Feb. 13: Major distribution day in both Nasdaq and S&P 500; shift down to 60%-80%.


March 15: A cluster of Nasdaq distribution days, five in 10 sessions, but no change in outlook.


April 4: Another strong distribution day, but Nasdaq's count still remains at 8; outlook downgraded to uptrend under pressure; exposure falls to 40%-60%.


April 11: Uptrend resumes; raise exposure to 60%-80%.


April 12: Uptrend under pressure; exposure returns to 40%-60%.


April 15: Nasdaq down 1.8% in heavy distribution day; trim stock market exposure to 20%-40%.



The moves above show how April 4 became a turning point for investors to take profits on the way up, defend gains, cut losses quickly, and take extra care in making any new purchases.


Following Wednesday's stock market action, the small-cap Russell 2000 has dropped 8.8% from its recent high of 2,135 vs. a 4.6% pullback by the S&P 500. The Nasdaq composite, which took out its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) on Monday, is now 5.2% below its all-time high of 16,538 set on March 21.

ASML Knocked
------------



A sharp sell-off by megacap chip-equipment supplier **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), which gapped lower at the open and dropped more than 7% to a two-month low, provided the impetus. The Dutch leader in advanced lithography systems used to etch electronic circuits [reported declines in both first-quarter earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-stock-q1-2024-earnings/). ASML reiterated that 2024 would be a year of flat sales growth.


Volume in ASML boomed 255% above the stock's 50-day moving average to 3.72 million shares, the highest amount since the company roared nearly 9% higher on Jan. 24, the date when it announced the prior quarterly results.


The knock-on effect from ASML's sell-off was immediate and fierce.


A quick look at the iShares Semiconductor ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) exchange traded fund reveals a correction going on in one of the hottest areas of the stock market since the Nov. 1 follow-through day. The ETF had risen as much as 59% since the Nov. 1 close. So, naturally it has more gains to surrender. On Wednesday, SOXX slid 3% in the highest volume in weeks and closed nearly 4% below its 50-day moving average.


ASML wasn't the only chip stock to trigger a sell rule by [taking out its 50-day moving average in vigorous trading](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Group Moves In The Stock Market Sell-Off
----------------------------------------


**Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) sliced through its 50-day line for the first time in months and dropped 5.3% in heavy volume. **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) fell 12% in accelerating volume and made its biggest one-day slide since Feb. 13. A remaining quarter-size position in Arm on Leaderboard exited on Wednesday.


**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), another key supplier in the burgeoning sectors of artificial intelligence and accelerated computing, reports first-quarter results early Thursday.


No doubt, the promise of artificial intelligence has not only boosted stock market returns since early 2023. But have investors gotten over-exuberant? Judging by ASML's sell-off, one could say yes in the near term. However, some market veterans suggest keeping an eye on the long-term picture.


Stay Long In The Long Run
-------------------------


"The timing of a momentum-based rally is always a tough one," Rick Pitcairn, chief global strategist and chairman of the $7 billion multifamily office wealth management firm Pitcairn, told IBD. Pitcairn compares the current uptrend since early 2023 to the dot-com bull run of the late 1990s. But he added, "Are we in 1996 or 1999? It is a fascinating question."


From Pitcairn's point of view, "we're still in the 'promise stage' of AI. It could be an extraordinary moment for humanity." The use of AI to quickly develop lifesaving or life-extending medicines is just one potential benefit. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the stock market will continue to "roll among the emotions of investors."


Since October, the move by the S&P 500 "has been almost vertical. That just cannot hold," Pitcairn added.



Phil Pecsok, managing partner at Los Angeles-based Anacapa Advisors ($50 million under management) and a veteran former market maker of Nasdaq stocks at Crowell Weedon, warned against trying to actively manage a stock-centered portfolio with a neutral basis. The reason? Stock market returns in growth stocks generally favor a strategy of being invested in leading companies over the longer run.


"You need to stay invested," Pecsok said. He noted the average return of long-short funds was a total 12% over the past five years. How about the "market neutral" class of actively managed funds? It earned the same, a paltry 12%. In contrast, since the end of March 2018, despite three separate stock market corrections of 20% or more by the S&P 500, the large-cap benchmark has nearly doubled from 2640 to 5022, up 90% excluding dividends. Pecsok added that the Anacapa fund has gained 120% over the same time frame.


In The IBD 50
-------------


Meanwhile, [at least 10 members of the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) bucked the stock market weakness with gains of 1% or more.


They included companies in areas such as gold and silver mining (**Agnico-Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPM)), the latter rising 2.8% and moving above a 50.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)); banking and financial services (**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) and **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR))); natural gas (**Dorian LPG** ([LPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPG))); and shoes (**On** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON))).


Could these areas of the market help keep the uptrend alive?


Keep a close eye on NYSE-listed companies in the near term. Breadth was far better on that exchange on Wednesday vs. the Nasdaq.


According to data from the General Market Indicators page (see link at the bottom of this story), decliners edged gainers on the NYSE by a slim margin of 6-to-5. On the Nasdaq, losers topped winners by a 5-3 margin.

Transportation Sector Tumbles
-----------------------------


Transportation stocks mostly fell, mainly on news of [weaker than expected results](https://www.investors.com/research/trucking-companies-jbhunt-saia-odfl-stock-earnings/) by trucking firm **J.B. Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)). The company announced disappointing results in its domestic intermodal business. At least seven of its industry compatriots fell 2 points or more in sympathy.


The Dow Jones transportation average notched its fifth decline in six days. After a 1.7% pounding on Wednesday, the Dow transports have now slipped nearly 5.7% year to date.


In the sector, **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) was a rare winner after it posted a smaller-than-expected Q1 net loss of 15 cents a share. Revenue climbed 10% to $12.5 billion.

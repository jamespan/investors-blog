Nasdaq Makes A Normal-Looking Pullback; Do These Indexes Foreshadow A Weaker Rebound?
======================================================================================

The Nasdaq, having rallied as much as 11% in the prior four sessions, seemed all but destined for a pullback. That's exactly what investors got Wednesday.




A 1.5% decline by the composite index on Wednesday may sting those who went long right before the market open. Data storage heavyweight **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) set the bearish tone early in the session. The Boise, Idaho-based leader in DRAM and NAND-type memory products warned that [its key markets would shrink in 2023](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-micron-warning-pulls-down-chip-stocks/).


Shares in Micron, which drove more than 15% higher in the prior two weeks, hold a 5.8% decline for the current week. A 32 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) precludes Micron from leadership status within the market.


Yet in the context of the overall market's fledgling uptrend, the Nasdaq's loss on Wednesday does not disturb the current upward trend. Plus, volume fell sharply on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday's session.


That's actually nice for the bulls. Lower volume on down days signals that the big boys and girls on Wall Street — from mutual funds and banks to pension plans and large investment advisors — are not dumping shares with vigor.


Nasdaq Megacap Up After Hours
-----------------------------



A [solid earnings beat and bullish profit guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/csco-stock-cisco-earnings-cisco-stock-q32022/) by **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) helped to raise hopes for the nascent rally to continue. Cisco, the 12th largest company by market cap on the Nasdaq, gained as much as 4% in extended-hours trading. The internet and communications gear titan is trying to bottom out after a 40% slide since December.


Go to the top of the Nasdaq's large chart in IBD's [General Market Indicators page](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_111522.pdf), at the bottom of every Big Picture column, to see an up-to-date list of the 30 largest companies on that all-electronic exchange.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% on Wednesday and closed just 4 points off its session low. That more or less wiped away Tuesday's healthy gain. Yet the large-cap benchmark still holds a decent 5.5% advance since the close of its [follow-through day on Oct. 21](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-roars-back-to-life-amid-new-fed-hopes-these-stocks-shine-brightest/).


Small caps felt more selling heat. But then again, these indexes have vaulted higher in recent weeks. The Russell 2000 slid 1.9%, closing a tad beneath its 200-day moving average. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged just 0.1% lower. Seven of its 30 components rose 1 point or more, including fast food behemoth **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), helping to buffer the blue chips' slide.


Plus, the Dow Jones index has been quite stingy with its losses after boldly crossing above its own 200-day moving average two weeks ago.


Volume shrank on the NYSE, early data showed.


So, based on these data points, you could make the case the market's small glass is half full.


Yet, could an IBD reader point to any evidence that the glass is half empty as well?


Beyond The Nasdaq
-----------------


Sure. Let's look at a few sector indexes.



![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP111622-193x300.jpg)VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) got rejected in its Tuesday attempt to reclaim its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). The ETF's 200-day line, which at a glance gives you a stock or index's average closing price over the past 10 months of trading, has been wilting since April.


Sellers bashed the Dow Jones transportation average for a 2.1% drubbing. At 14,306, the transports maintain a small cushion above the 200-day line. This index's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has been climbing for four straight weeks and recently marked an eight-month high.


Finally, SPDR Consumer Discretionary ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)), a popular exchange traded fund, sank 1.5%, even though U.S. retail sales grew 1.3% in October vs. the prior month. That figure beat expectations for a 1% rise. On Tuesday, XLY tried to lumber back above its fast-falling 50-day moving average, but to no avail.


What is universal among strong bull markets over the past century? They all showed widening breadth, solid breakouts among CAN SLIM-quality issues, and a virtual absence of stocks gapping down on disappointing results. This current run has made snaillike progress on some of these fronts.


Plus, earnings season is not over, and it's still making individual stock picking a tricky game.


On Wednesday, retail results dominated the early news headlines, and as companies such as **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) have shown, Wall Street dishes up either a feast or famine on a daily basis.


Target's 13% plunge Wednesday? It was especially notable on two counts. One, shares had failed to retake the downward-sloping 200-day moving average the prior day.



Two, turnover on Target surged to 36.6 million shares on the day, the second highest amount so far this year. Target announced a three-year plan to cut costs by $3 billion. One can only expect the discount retail chain to follow in the footsteps of some Silicon Valley tech giants in making sharp staff cuts.


[The latest Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) calls for weekly jobless claims to actually fall by 3,000 to 222,000. Data comes out Thursday before the opening bell. Despite a small increase in the October unemployment rate, the U.S. labor market remains tight as a drum — for now.

How Are Hedge Funds Doing?
--------------------------


PivotalPath, a hedge fund research firm, said in its monthly report that hedge funds "performed relatively well and consistently against a backdrop of volatile yet appreciating equity markets by the end of October." Its composite index rose 1.3%, fully recouping a September loss of 1.2% and then some.


The PivotalPath Composite Index also shows a 1.6% drop year to date, sharply outperforming an 18% decline by the S&P 500. Yet interestingly, the research has also found that the dispersion of fund managers' performance between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile through September stands at 21%, a full 9 percentage points higher than the 10-year average of 12%.


The Nasdaq, weighted much more heavily in megacap techs, slid 30% over the same January-to-October time frame.


At 11,183, the Nasdaq still languishes with a 28.5% loss since Jan. 1. It also lies 31% below the all-time peak of 16,212.


Bullish Vibes Expand
--------------------


Meanwhile, the latest Investors Intelligence weekly poll of market newsletter writers found bullishness rise to 38.6% in the past week from 35.2%. The bears ratio dropped to 32.8% from 36.6% and hit a two-month low.

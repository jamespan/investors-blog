The stock market suffered a bearish reversal Friday but still turned in excellent gains for the first half of 2024. Now, the latest Fed minutes and a new jobs report loom large heading into the shortened Independence Day trading week.




The Nasdaq composite notched an intraday all-time high before retreating and finishing with a 0.2% loss. It is above its 21-day line and is 5.9% beyond its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It turned in its ninth weekly gain out of the past 10 with a 0.2% lift. Further, the tech-heavy composite ended the first half of 2024 up 18.1%.


The S&P 500 also hit fresh heights before closing the session down 0.2%. The benchmark index snapped a three-week winning streak as it suffered a weekly decline of 0.1%. Still, it holds a stout gain of 14.5% thus far this year.


Stock Market Distribution Days Added
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP062824.jpg)Advancers actually ended the day with an edge on decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was high on both amid the annual rebalancing of the Russell indexes.


Heavy volume meant a distribution day was added to both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, though one also dropped off the latter index due to time expiration.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better on Friday than the other two major indexes, dipping 0.1%, but its gain for the year of 3.8% is far less impressive. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) led the upside here while **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) plummeted 20% amid disappointing quarterly results.


Small caps fought back to close in the green as the Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. It has retaken its 50-day line but is only up slightly more than 1% for the year. The Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.8% but holds a year-to-date gain of 14%.


While the stock market is near highs, with Investor's Business Daily recommending exposure at the 80% to 100% level, holding closer to the lower end of the scale will offer investors some cushion in case there is a pullback. With the market giving mixed signals, investors should be cautious about opening any new positions.


Chevron Overturned, Fed Minutes Due
-----------------------------------


Stocks initially rose after the latest personal consumption expenditures price index met economist views. Core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, slowed to year-over-year growth of 2.6%. This was the slowest rise since March 2021. Headline PCE held steady on a monthly basis for the first time in six months and also slowed to 2.6% growth on an annualized basis.


Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also made a major move by overturning the Chevron doctrine in a 6-3 decision. This means judges no longer have to defer to how federal agencies interpret the law when legislative language is not clear.


This will have a big impact on the federal government, affecting areas including financial services, health care, tariffs and labor law. Analysts believe energy, climate and environmental regulations face the most impact.


U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Suzanne Clark said in a written statement that the ruling will "help create a more predictable and stable regulatory environment."


The coming trading week is shortened one day due to the stock market closure for the Independence Day holiday on Thursday. It's still expected to remain busy with a raft of economic data due, including the release of the latest Fed minutes Wednesday. The document, to cover the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting, could offer further clues on the future path of rates.


The labor market also will be in focus, with a new ADP employment report expected Wednesday. But the key reading is Friday's planned U.S. employment report for June, with analysts forecasting that the U.S. economy added 272,000 nonfarm jobs during the month.


Next week should be [relatively quiet on the earnings front](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-constellation-brands/). **MSC Industrial** ([MSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSM)), **Simulations Plus** ([SLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLP)) and **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) are among the companies reporting.


Nike Plunge Hurts This Industry Group
-------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) on Friday. Communication services and consumer discretionary were the strongest areas while energy and technology lagged.


For investors seeking a deeper insight into trading action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), the relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups offered a more granular view.



Radio and television stocks, educational consumer services plays, steel producers and super regional banks were among the best performers.Â On the other side of the coin, solar stocks, computer hardware companies, hospitals and database software firms were among the laggards.


The shoes and related manufacturing group also lagged amid Nike's plunge. The Dow Jones component and athletics apparel giant was given a harsh spanking by the bears after it cut its full-year outlook and missed analysts consensus sales view. Nike suffered its biggest single-day percentage drop on record and erased more than four years of gains.

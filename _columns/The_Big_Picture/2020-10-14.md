The Nasdaq composite led the stock market lower Wednesday, as stocks give a cool reaction to the first week of earnings season. The Nasdaq retreated as much as 1.3% before cutting losses. IBD [Stock Of The Day Netflix](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/netflix-stock-hits-buy-point-q3-earnings-report/) broke out above a new buy point, while tech giants Amazon.com, Apple and Tesla offer new buy points.




The Nasdaq underperformed with a 0.8% loss. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved down 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.9%.


Leading growth stocks also ended squarely lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF slid 0.7%. Inside the IBD 50, **XP** ([XP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XP)) and **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) jumped 4.5% and 2.4%, respectively. XP is still below its 50-day line, while Pool is climbing nicely after a recent breakout above a 338.98 buy point in a cup with handle.


Volume was lower from Tuesday's session on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Stock Market Rally Pauses
-------------------------


![MP101420_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP101420_2-240x300.jpg)After the Nasdaq snapped a four-day win streak Tuesday, the tech-heavy composite continued lower Wednesday with sharp losses. Tuesday's Big Picture discussed the constructive nature of an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/), but Wednesday was a different story, as indexes reversed lower and closed near session lows.


Despite the Nasdaq's retreat, lower volume meant the index avoided its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the new market uptrend. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 avoided a second-straight day of institutional selling due to slightly lower NYSE volume.


On Monday, the stock market received a [jolt of confidence](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-signals-positive-as-nasdaq-rallies-higher-volume/) when the Nasdaq staged a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) rally confirmation. The latest follow-through day came almost two weeks after the Dow Jones industrials' follow-through on Sept. 30.


Despite the recent weakness, stock market sentiment remains positive. Investors should still be building exposure amid a growing number of breakouts among top growth stocks. However, if new breakouts start to stumble, and even fail, then it would be a sign to take a more cautious stance.

New Breakouts To Watch: ASML, Netflix
-------------------------------------


**ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) is trying to break out past a 401.25 buy point in a double bottom. Shares gave up the entry on Wednesday, following the company's [Q3 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-earnings-q3-2020-asml-stock/). The stock fell 1.8% Wednesday.


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/netflix-stock-hits-buy-point-q3-earnings-report/), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), briefly broke out past a 557.49 buy point in a double bottom, according to a [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. But shares reversed lower amid the stock market weakness, closing with a 2.3% loss.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Netflix stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx) boasts a 98 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.


A potential flaw is the stock's lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/). The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter, but that hasn't happened yet.


Meanwhile, stock market leaders **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) are approaching new buy points.


Amazon is forming a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 3,552.35 buy point. Apple is more than 10% away from a 138.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup base. After easing the past couple of days, look for a handle to form on both stocks.


Tesla extended a win streak to six days Wednesday with a 3.3% advance. The [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock is approaching a 502.59 buy point in an awkward base.


How To Handle Earnings Season
-----------------------------


Third-quarter earnings season is here, which means it's time for the stock market to separate the winners from the losers.


Strong earnings can propel top stocks to previously unforeseen levels, while a disappointing announcement can send shares tumbling. Being able to buy a stock when it is strong and advancing is a key principle of [how to invest](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/) in top growth stocks.


The stock market's reaction to an earnings release can often tell you more than the earnings themselves. If the results seem strong, but the stock sells off, then investors may be concerned about the sustainability of growth, rising costs or myriad other potential negatives.


Before purchasing a new stock, check the earnings due date to ensure you're not buying a stock just before the company's earnings report. If the company is about to report, perhaps start buying a half position to help cut down on some of the excessive risk.


Then, if the stock rockets higher or even [stages a breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/), you could potentially add the remaining half position. If the stock gaps down, then you avoided some of the downside. Other investors may decide to use the [IBD options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/) to help limit risk.

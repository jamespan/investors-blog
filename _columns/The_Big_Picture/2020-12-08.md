Stocks Today Flex Bullish Behavior Again; Is It Time To Take Profits In Snowflake?
===================================================================================

If you don't like the start on Wall Street, wait for a few hours. Or go back and take a look near the end of the day.




The session in stocks today more or less proved this maxim of a fair-weather bull market: It brushes off early-morning weakness and finishes strongly.


To be fair, Tuesday's gains weren't that strong. But the cadence of the action should give IBD readers confidence that various conditions — macroeconomic, monetary, corporate, international — could help sustain the Santa Claus rally.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) forged higher for an 11th straight session. It turned a mildly eyebrow-raising morning loss of 0.7% into an acceptable 0.3% gain by day's end. Other key benchmarks followed suit. The Nasdaq composite lifted 0.5%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 etched gains in the 0.3%-0.4% range.


Small caps dominated once again; iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) coasted ahead 1.3%. It racked up an all-time new high for a third day in a row.


Volume was roughly flat on both exchanges.


MP120820Stocks Today: Bullish Technical Signs
---------------------------------------------


The General Market Indicator (GMI) Charts page currently shows multiple reasons why stock pickers should focus on [strong breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and [powerful rebounds off the 50-day and 10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/add-trading-playbook-rebound-10-week-line/).


First, the S&P 500 held a positive B Accumulation/Distribution Rating headed into Tuesday's trade. The Nasdaq pushed its rating into positive ground with a C+. These ratings cover 13 weeks' worth of action. They include the action since a pivotal [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/) that took place in the [Dow industrials and S&P 500 on Nov. 4](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/).


(Find this special charts page via a link at the bottom of every Big Picture column, or by clicking on the blue-tinted link on the [Market Trend landing page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).)


Second, the breadth of the advance keeps improving.


Notice in the Nasdaq's daily chart on the GMI Charts page how its advance-decline line has been rising for more than five weeks.


Now, check out the slope of this advance-decline line; it's rising at a steeper angle than the NYSE's version. Find that one in the S&P 500's chart.


Third, a few more stocks broke out with gusto on Tuesday.


**Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), riding a new wave in home remodeling and improvement trends accelerated by Covid-19, [joined Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a new quarter-size position Tuesday. The midcap stock cleared a handle entry point at 86.06. The firm saw Q3 earnings surge 107% to 56 cents a share on a 31% top-line increase. Volume jumped 61% above its current 50-day average of 823,000 shares per day.


Theme For 2021: The Challenge For Techs
---------------------------------------


**Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is preserving, for now, its catapult-like advance last week following brilliant results in the October-ended fiscal first quarter. The security software innovator has now gained more than 19% since it cleared a 158.84 buy point in a [perfect double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).



**Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) gained 0.3% after a big reversal on Tuesday. Clearly, some folks on Wall Street sold hard into the advance past 400.


Short-term traders in the data warehousing innovator could decide to lock in at least partial gains past a 301.10 buy point. Longer-term holders may want to tighten their seat belt for a likely volatile ride.


Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, told IBD in an interview that he sees 2021 as a key juncture for techs. Many companies enjoyed robust sales and big contracts as coronavirus spurred a heavy increase in spending to build out digital infrastructures. But Ma wonders how many of the smaller firms will succeed in maintaining big top-line growth and achieving profitability amid heavy competition in such fields as enterprise software, data analytics, e-commerce and human capital management.


There could be a "limitation in their ability to grow sales as they scale," Ma said. "The market right now may have swung a bit in the pendulum toward the benefit of doubt in these companies, a little bit on the accommodative side, so to speak. In 2021, we'll really see which companies have staying power."


Theme For 2021: Will The Energy Sector Show More Pep?
-----------------------------------------------------


Another piece of evidence that the market rally is broadening can be found in the surprising rise of energy stocks in IBD's sector-based [research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-dec-07-2020/).


On Tuesday, Energy ranked No. 5 for mid- and long-term price performance. Solar and battery-related firms have been hot all year, thanks in part to technological advances and a growing emphasis on ESG investing principles. But they still make up a small chunk of this once-massive sector.



Pure-play oil and gas plays with strong IBD ratings are about as common as a tumbleweed rolling down the 405 freeway in Los Angeles — for now. Companies such as **Chart Industries** ([GTLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTLS)) (96 Composite Rating) and **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) (clearing a 26.83 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a new handle, B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating) in the oil machinery group are trying to keep up with their stronger peers.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), meanwhile, and **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) represent an anticipation on Wall Street of better times for the heavy construction and agricultural markets.


Longer-Term Inflation Outlook
-----------------------------


Big Wall Street banks continue to see a sanguine monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and other key central banks. But further down the road, keep an eye on inflationary gauges. The Fed's response to a future spike in consumer prices will be heavily watched.


Daniel Ahn, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas, said in a webinar Monday that he expects "the U.S. to close its output gap by the end of 2022." In other words, production capacity could get strained, forcing prices to go up. Ahn also sees U.S. inflation "picking up significantly from that time frame and potentially even exceeding the Fed's well-stated target of 2% in 2023 if (it occurs) in conjunction with further fiscal stimulus."


The key U.S. 10-year bond yielded 0.92% on Tuesday, down 2 basis points. The long 30-year bond guaranteed a 1.67% yield.

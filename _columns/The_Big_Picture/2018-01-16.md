title: Stocks Reverse Lower; Why A Pullback Now Seems More Likely

Stock indexes made a bearish reversal Tuesday, in the first sign that the market's hot start of 2018 is cooling off.




 Indexes gapped up at the open, but soon started paring gains, with no apparent trigger. They went negative about 2 p.m. ET and continued to drop steadily until they stabilized in the final hour. By the close, the damage was widespread.


The Nasdaq composite started the day up about 1% and closed with a 0.5% loss. Other indexes made similarly poor reversals. The S&P 500 lost 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average ended a fraction lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.2%. The Dow transports, which had been shining this month, tumbled 1.3%.


Decliners beat advancers by a 2-1 ratio. Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, which resulted in a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). Volume seemed almost guaranteed to rise from Friday's slower-than-normal session.

The Nasdaq had surged more than 6% during the month to Tuesday's peak. The Dow crossed above 26,000 for the first time before reversing lower. It had topped 25,000 less than two weeks ago.


All major indexes made new highs early Tuesday before changing course. In a symptom of the unusual strength, three distribution days were erased in the past several days because indexes had risen more than 5% from those dates. The Dec. 29 distribution day had already been erased on the Nasdaq and was also deducted after the S&P 500's early surge Tuesday.


The market finds itself in the odd position where it is almost void of any distribution, but could still be pulling back. Tuesday's bearish reversals after solid increases are just one sign the market could be cooling off.


Since September, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had traded within price channels that guided their advance. But starting last week, indexes rose above those price channels. That was a sign the market was getting too warm. Still, indexes remain in longer-term channels.


Some key stocks acted poorly Tuesday:  **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) closed below the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/); **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reversed lower.


In the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), the majority of stocks reversed lower. **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) not only reversed badly but also suffered a bearish outside day, when the price range swings far outside the prior day's.


With a market pullback more likely now, investors need to watch themselves. It would be smart to be patient with new breakouts, watching if they hold up during the session before making a purchase. Some that broke out in the past couple of weeks may erase gains or otherwise be weakened.



There were lots of breakouts Tuesday but many were short-lived. **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) started to race to new highs, only to sink back into their bases. Atlassian reports earnings Thursday after the close.


By industry groups, industrial, biotech, retail, solar, oilfield machinery and logistics were some of the worst Tuesday.


But health care was one of the few areas that saw some institutional buyers. Drug wholesalers, managed care, outpatient care, gold miners and food were groups (some of those defensive in character) that rose on the day.  Some oil groups also outperformed.

Bears Rip Stocks As Market Shifts To Correction
================================================

U.S. stock indexes suffered a knockout punch Wednesday, as IBD's market outlook switched to stock market in correction. In the meantime, the bulls hailed a technical sign of a short-term bottom.




The Nasdaq careened 4.1% lower, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Small caps kept their losses smaller, as the S&P 600 fell 2.8%. Still, the S&P 600 closed below its 200-day moving average.


Volume was higher on both major exchanges. Declining stocks led advancers by more than 8-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 7-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


The nasty action was enough to kick the outlook to stock market in correction status for the first time since March 27-April 9. After the April 10 [follow-through-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) close, the Nasdaq advanced about 15%.

A few bank groups chalked up moderate gains in the morning, and then reversed to losses.


The stock market looks increasingly like an escalator that only works in one direction — down. Consider these factors:


— New lows swamped new highs again Wednesday. The new low count has been six to 10 times greater than new highs in recent sessions.


— The put/call volume ratio, a secondary indicator, finally closed at 1.15, signaling a bottom is either here or near. Sometimes, though, it takes more than one such signal before a low in the market is pegged. With indexes oversold, a dead-cat bounce may be more likely than a true rebound, which is why IBD-style investors prefer to wait for a follow-through.


— Support lines have failed. The Nasdaq knifed under its 50-day moving average Oct. 4 and then stabbed under its 200-day line Wednesday for the first time since June 2016.


The S&P 500 fell in spoon-sized portions until Wednesday's straight move down, falling sharply below its 50-day line and putting the stock market in correction.


Painful Cure
------------


What can cure this market?


The cure for lower prices and ugly action is even lower prices and even more ugly action. That's another reason why IBD-style investors prefer to raise cash and wait for a return to a confirmed uptrend.


Bulls can be reasonably certain that if the stock market in correction continues, the value crowd will eventually step in and start buying.


There's no guarantee, though, that the value investors will time it correctly.


For example, the S&P 500 pierced its 200-day line in February, April and May. But the rebounds were short-lived until the May to September run.


The current pullback in the stock market has led to a rash of explanations. Most of the explanations have little to do with the market's direction.


O'Neil's Advice
---------------


In "The Successful Investor," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote, "To be highly accurate in any pursuit, you must carefully observe and analyze the object itself. If you want to know about tigers, watch tigers — not the weather, not the vegetation, not the other animals on the mountain."


O'Neil added, "You want to stay in phase with what the market is actually doing, not with what you hope it will do or what other people think it should do."


Where does that leave the IBD investor?


Raising cash is prudent. Do not let hope overrule sell rules. This market is a flashing red light. Taking a few profits and keeping the money on the sidelines is prudent.

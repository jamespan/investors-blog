U.S. stock indexes Thursday continued recent sideways action, though the Nasdaq suffered a technical penalty.


The Nasdaq lost 0.4%, while the S&P 500 stepped back less than 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. The small cap S&P 600, which has led the so-called Trump rally, dropped 1%.


![mp122216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122216.png)Volume in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) was up from Wednesday's pace, but that wasn't much of an achievement. Wednesday's volume was the lowest since the post-Thanksgiving session.


Technically, the Nasdaq's action met the definition of distribution — a sizable gain in rising volume. Because the previous session's volume was extremely low, the meaning of rising volume remains uncertain.


The day will go down on the score card as distribution, but not the sort of data that can pierce through the fog.


When fog obscures an investor's vision, the best thing to do is go through the IBD drill. Check the primary and secondary indicators and see what is revealed.


* The chief and only primary indicator is the market itself. While the distribution count is high on the Nasdaq, much of it is bunched up from Nov. 28 to Dec. 1. The S&P 500 has a more normal count of three. Resistance areas to watch: Around 2,275 on the S&P 500 and roughly 5,485 on the Nasdaq.
* The IBD News Issues Index: Gains are roughly in line with the Nasdaq. This is a gauge of aggressiveness/frothiness.
* Small-cap growth funds vs. big-cap growth funds: Since August, small-cap funds have outperformed but recently the line has shifted sideways. The rally's leader could be losing some of its steam.
* [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders): The most stringent IBD screen, it is netting only three names, not a good sign. But IBD's Utility Leaders is also down to a few names, which could be regarded as bullish.
* S&Ls, banks and chips are routinely the top three among 33 sectors. But the fastest-rising sectors are metals, transports and building.
* Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears ratio is suggesting the market is near a top.
* Day after day, the adjusted new highs tally is comfortably and bullishly above new lows. The bank sector is consistently tallying the most new highs.


What's the bottom line on this?


There are enough negatives developing that 100% exposure in individual stocks seems too rich for current conditions. Taking some profits and closing the book on laggards would seem prudent.


Action among top-rated stocks Thursday was sparse, though **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) retook a 37.80 handle buy point. The July initial public offering shaped its first base of standard length since debuting on the Nasdaq.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, retail groups accounted for the day's four worst performers, according to preliminary data. Oil pipelines and refiners nailed down the top two spots.


In economic news, Q3 GDP came in at 3.5%, inching above the entire range of estimates. Durable goods orders were weaker than expected, but ex transportation, the number topped the consensus estimate. Core capital goods, a proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.9% in November vs. only 0.2% in October.


On Friday, new home sales for November and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge will be released about a half-hour after the open.

The major stock indexes rallied with exceptionally broad participation Monday, as the slog of August became more distant.




The S&P 500 made a record closing high after making a 1.1% jump and closing near session highs. The Nasdaq composite also rose 1.1%.


Other indexes made strides of more than 1%, from the Dow Jones industrial average to the Dow utilities to the small-cap Russell 2000. The Russell, closing at 1414, made it back above its 50-day moving average, a hopeful sign.


Monday's surge was not about what happened but more about what *didn't* happen. Hurricane Irma started fading in strength and appeared to cause less damage than feared. North Korea did not conduct a missile test over the weekend as it had promised. As Monday's opening bell rang, investors exhaled.

Nasdaq volume rose 1.5%. But trading levels were lower than Friday's on the NYSE. It was surprising that a rally as sharp and as broad as Monday's did not generate more buying from institutional investors on that major exchange.


No matter, quite a few stocks took advantage of the rally and [broke out past buy points](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/), including leaders in scientific equipment (where **Waters** ([WAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAT)) broke out), aerospace (**Textron** ([TXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXT))), semiconductors (**Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX))), security software (**FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE))) and soft drinks (**Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO))).


Real estate investment trusts continued to produce breakouts. **Armour Residential REIT** ([ARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARR)), which replaced **Brink's** ([BCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCO)) in the S&P 600 Monday morning, gapped up past the 26.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in big volume.


**Stag Industrial** ([STAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STAG)), **Potlatch** ([PCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCH)) and **Essex Property Trust** ([ESS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESS)) also topped buy points but all had weak volume, reversed lower by the close, or showed both types of action.


IBD's REIT industry groups were up about 1% as different asset classes that yield-seeking investors prefer were all higher. The Dow utilities average jumped more than 1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 8 basis points to 2.13%, a one-week high.


Banking stocks climbed thanks to the leap in yields and despite that **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) warned Q3 markets revenue will be weaker than a year ago. The warning was similar to ones from other major banks.


Banks no longer lead the market, but some leading groups gleamed. Homebuilders, scientific equipment makers and gaming software publishers performed well. The chip equipment industry group was up nearly 3%.


The major indexes still have a half-dozen [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) chalked up over the past five weeks. That's a burdensome load, but some of those higher-volume losses are getting farther off in the distance. They occurred in the first half of August, when the market was trending downward.

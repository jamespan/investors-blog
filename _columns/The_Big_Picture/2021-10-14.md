Stock Market Powers Up; These Four Top Growth Stocks In Or Near Buy Zones
==========================================================================

The major stock indexes rallied sharply Thursday, as the stock market received a boost from strong corporate earnings. There was broad strength, with **Advanced Micro** **Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) rising near buy points.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market jumped at the open in the wake of [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-gain-ahead-of-q3-earnings-reports/) from banking giants **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), resulting in a 1.7% advance in shares of the Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) ETF. Meanwhile, health insurer **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) [topped earnings targets](https://www.investors.com/news/unitedhealth-earnings-q3-2021-unh-stock/), fueling a 7.4% surge before the stock cut gains to 4.2%. The stock briefly topped a 431.46 flat-base entry, but closed below the buy point.


Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield slid below 1.52%, falling for a third straight session. The yield was above 1.6% on Friday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP101421-256x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 1.7%, closing at session highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.6% and the S&P 500 added 1.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.4%.


Leading growth stocks sharply climbed as well, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added more than 1.6%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) surged over 10%, breaking out past a 346.64 buy point in a rare high, tight flag.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but appeared to inch lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq's strong gain in higher volume resulted in a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), a confirmation of the rally that started Oct. 5. The signal ends a [stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-ends-september-with-ugly-reversal-why-the-outlook-is-worse-today/) that started about two weeks ago, on Sept. 30.


As [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) has been discussing, investors should be prepared for a new uptrend with updated watchlists. Now, it is time to put those watchlists to work.


Keep in mind a follow-through day is not a sign to plunge into the market. Remember, not every follow-through day leads to big gains. So, wade into the new uptrend slowly and methodically by making test purchases, as top growth stocks break out past correct buy points. If a new uptrend is real and lasting, there will be plenty of time to make money.


Positively, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 closed above their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq will likely face a test of its 50-day moving average line in upcoming sessions. Further progress above these levels would provide more confidence in the nascent uptrend.

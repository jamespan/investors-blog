The stock market started the month on a winning note despite falling Friday after a hot jobs report. A Monday **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) stock split and the latest Fed meeting now loom large.




The Nasdaq composite is trading clear of its short-term and its major moving averages despite falling 0.2% for the session. It notched a solid gain of 2.4% for the first week of June and has climbed 14.1% so far in 2024.


The S&P 500 closed near record highs despite slipping 0.1% for the day. The benchmark index sits more than 1% above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) thanks to a weekly gain of 1.3%. It has gained in six of the past seven weeks and holds a gain of 12.1% for the year.


Decliners led advancers by more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and almost 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was mixed on the main exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%, closing bang on the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It inched 0.3% higher for the week. **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) was the strongest Dow stock during the session while **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) fell the most. The latter accounted for about 74 of the Dow's 112-point drop.


Small caps got hit the hardest, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.1% and undercutting the 50-day line. Growth stocks also struggled, with the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) falling 0.9%.


Jobs Report Hot; Nvidia Stock Split And Fed Meeting Next
--------------------------------------------------------


Stocks ended Friday lower after the latest jobs report came in hot. The U.S. economy [added 272,000 jobs in May](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-may-unemployment-rate-fed-rate-cuts-sp-500/), crushing views for growth of 188,000. Despite this, the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.0%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% vs. the previous month and 4.1% year-over-year. The data sent the 10-year Treasury yield up 15 basis points to 4.428%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP060724-272x300.jpg)Monday sees a big change for market leader Nvidia, as the AI stock's 10-for-1 stock split goes into effect. [The stock is up 144% so far this year](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-nvidia-nvda.htm).


It is also a massive week for the broader market. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting takes place Tuesday and Wednesday. While interest rates are expected to hold steady, investors will be listening closely to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting media conference for indications of future policy.


The decision coincides with the another inflation report, with the Consumer Price Index for May dropping on Wednesday. A new Producer Price Index reading comes the following day. [Earnings reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/oracle-stock-broadcom-show-strength-ahead-of-earnings-adobe-stuck-in-downtrend/) include **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)).


GameStop Plunge Hits Stock Market Group
---------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors had a mixed session](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) on Friday. Financials and technology fared the best while materials and utilities, the latter a defensive area and sensitive to interest rates, lagged.


The relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups gave a deeper insight into the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).



Media periodicals, foreign banks, tools companies and database software plays and diversified medical stocks were among the best performers.


In contrast, gold miners, specialty consumer products stocks, metal miners, solar plays and paint makers were among the laggards.


Consumer electronics retailers struggled the most, though. This was due to underperformance from **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), which plunged 39.4% in massive volume after the firm posted disappointing quarterly results and announced a stock sale. Trading was halted multiple times.


Also Friday, meme stock investor Keith Gill, who is known online as "Roaring Kitty," made [a highly touted livestreaming event](https://www.investors.com/news/gamestop-stock-q1-earnings/) about the equity on YouTube. His pronouncements earlier in the week caused the stock to rise sharply.

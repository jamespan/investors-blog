Stock Market Sell-Off Creates First Bearish Outlook Since April 2 Follow-Through Day
=====================================================================================

Five months after IBD noted a change in the [current outlook for stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) for the better, the stock market on Tuesday showed that the latest pullback stood deeply in contrast with all others in recent months.




A 4.1% slide by the Nasdaq on Tuesday followed a wild two-day selling spree last week that took the composite index down by as much as 1,180 points from its latest all-time high. The premier index for growth stocks also penetrated its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time in nearly 20 weeks.


On Tuesday, the Nasdaq finished at 10,847, about 33 points below where the 50-day line sits.


Meanwhile, worsening action by a greater number of leading growth stocks and disappointing round-trips among new breakouts justified a downgrade in the outlook for stocks to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Market in confirmed uptrend."


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MP4x2_090820-205x300.jpg)This marks the first change in the market outlook since the S&P 500 slugged the bears with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 2. (You can read more about that pivotal change in the market trend in this [April 2 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/).)


The S&P 500, down 2.8% on Tuesday, is seeing the cushion above its own 50-day moving average shrink fast. At 3331, the large-cap benchmark has dropped as much as 7% below a new all-time peak of 3588.


NYSE volume rose vs. Friday. That marks a [fourth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the S&P 500, indicating that institutional-class selling accelerated.


After the market close, [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) noted 732 companies that fell in heavy volume vs. 139 that advanced in above-average turnover.


The Nasdaq has now fallen 10% from its all-time peak. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF dropped 12.1% from a 52-week high set on Jan. 17, and Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is off 10.7% from last week's all-time high of 39.95. The IBD 50 ETF  undercut its 50-day line on Friday and has now given back most of its gains after a breakout past 35.14 in a nearly five-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/).


What should an IBD reader, new to the [CAN SLIM system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) or a multi-decade veteran, do now?


The market downgrade means that [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) should be avoided since they now stand a far less chance of working.


Stock Market Today: Breakouts Failing
-------------------------------------



Just look at what **Virtu Financial** ([VIRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIRT)) did on Tuesday, and you can see the willingness of fund managers to sell into strength, instead of buying on the breakout. At one point, the market maker in a host of securities rallied as much as 6% above a new 26.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [six-week cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). It closed down 1.7%


Raising cash by selling your weakest stocks quickly and [taking solid double-digit percentage gains before they disappear](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) also takes precedence in a market such as today's.


**Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) had been acting like a leader since it dashed past a 78.29 buy point in a large, deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in mid-June. But now, a 19% paper profit is gone.


The Aug. 27 undercut of the 50-day moving average proved to be a timely sell signal.



Chip-equipment and other semiconductor firms got walloped on news over the weekend that the U.S. government was weighing new measures to restrict the use of U.S.-made technology by SMIC, China's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors. The stock plunged 23% in Hong Kong on Monday, then rallied just 3% on Tuesday.


Sentiment Indicators Show Interesting Action
--------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, fear has been rising. That's excellent for the uptrend. The prior two weeks simply defined investor froth. Look at big winners such as **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and the chart graphed this excessive greed.


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or the VIX, has spiked in recent days.


Go to the daily chart of the VIX, and you'll see on Sept. 4 the fear indicator among options traders reached as high as 38.28. Why is this meaningful? IBD research has found that when the VIX rises more than 20% above its 10-day simple moving average, it can confirm — but not guarantee — a positive reversal.


This [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vix-volatility-index-can-confirm-stock-market-bottoms-coronavirus-bear-market/) details more about the concept behind this market volatility gauge.


In Other Financial Markets
--------------------------


Oil futures fell to a session low of $36.13 a barrel, down more than 8% on worries about weak demand.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 3 basis points to 0.69%. The yield began 2020 at 1.88%.

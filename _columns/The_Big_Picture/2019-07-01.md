The Nasdaq composite chalked up a 1%-or-more advance for the fifth time in nearly as many weeks on Monday, boosted by news over the weekend of no new import tariffs between China and the U.S.




After being up as much as 1.8% at the get-go, the tech-centered index settled for a 1.1% gain. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) gained more than 1.3%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF advanced 1.2%.


The Russell 2000 lagged. A 0.2% gain proved disappointing, especially when the popular gauge of small cap stocks had risen as much as 1.3% early Monday. But a second straight close above the 50-day moving average deserved note among market bulls.


New Closing High For The S&P 500
--------------------------------


The S&P 500, like the Nasdaq, dropped steadily after gaining as much as 1.2% in the opening minutes. But a nearly 0.8% finish higher reflected late-hour buying and a Monday rally that extended beyond tech stocks. The S&P 500 also showed luster as it marked a new closing high of 2964.

CLOSE




The large-cap benchmark also scored a successful third attempt to overcome resistance at the 2940-2950 price level.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP070119-264x300.jpg)Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges vs. the prior session. But the comparison was skewed because Friday included a humongous boost in turnover in the final minutes as institutional investors reacted to the annual rebalancing of Russell equity indexes.


On a bullish note, though, volume had been tracking higher vs. comparable times on Friday for most of the session.


That hinted at a healthy appetite for stocks among pension funds, banks, insurers, mutual funds and large investment advisors.


President Donald Trump, without giving concrete details, remarked at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, over the weekend that he would allow business transactions between U.S. tech companies and global telecom gear firm Huawei Technologies.


Chip firms with strong ties to China galloped higher. The fabless semiconductor, chip manufacturing and chip equipment groups rose 2.6% or more, according to early data. Data storage, fiber optics and design software also boasted market-beating gains for the day.



**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) rallied more than 2% in volume below average for the chipmaker, but higher than Friday. At 31.20, the [Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) has now stretched nearly 4% above a 30.05 buy point.


The large cap is showing promise, according to analysts, in its new high-speed chip designs for a variety of key markets. But AMD also has a joint venture with a Chinese firm (Sugon Information Industry) that had been placed on a U.S. blacklist.


Beyond The Nasdaq: Five Clues To A Strong Third Quarter
-------------------------------------------------------


As noted in [Friday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-led-by-financials-small-cap-stocks/), the first-half performance of the S&P 500 was definitely strong, but not one of the strongest when coming off a bear market. Makes sense, too, when you consider that since the market's 2009 low, the S&P 500 has delivered a roughly 19% gain on a compounded annual basis through this year.


Put another way, the bull has aged.


You've likely heard the adage that bull markets don't die of age. What can IBD readers do to check on the market's health in the coming months? Consider these five clues.


**One**: Watch a list of leading stocks regularly. Top stocks tend to rise more sharply during a general up day for the market. And they can fall with the force of boulders when the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fall 1% or more.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a fruitful session on Monday. Looking at the list of names as of Thursday, 20 of the 50 stocks — or 40% — gained 1.5% or more for the day.



The top dog on Monday: [IBD Leaderboard name](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), up 7.5% in solid turnover. The stock surged nicely above its original buy point of 49.20 in a six-week cup without handle base. It also rolled past an alternate entry at 52.14.


**Two**: Keep a running tally of new breakouts. IBD's [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) columns, the Stocks On The Move table, and the daily new highs list offer good sources. So does the [home page of MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), which on Monday used chart pattern recognition software to tag at least seven stocks [making a breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


**Three**: Watch to see if market leaders, especially the ones in your portfolio, show enough muscle to rise 20% to 25% from a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). When this happens, it's a great time to [take at least some profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


Market Leaders Should Do This
-----------------------------



**Four**: Hunt for [high-quality bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Look for those that show symmetry within their pattern and smooth price action. So far, **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) is aiming to land in such circles, although much of the new nine-week base is below the 50-day line. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) has traded tight lately. Ditto for recent [IBD Stock Of The Day company](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and solar energy play **Sunrun** ([RUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUN)) before its June 18 breakout past a 17.54 pivot point.


[The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) in Sunrun extended up to 18.42.


**Five**: Don't ignore the Fed. The central U.S. bank, for now, is committed to cutting the cost of money, not increasing it. That's good for equities.


Research from Sadoff Investment Management of Milwaukee finds that the average one-year gain for the S&P 500 is 22.2% after the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield falls 25% or more in three months. "This makes sense since lower interest rates stimulate business growth and the stock market," the firm wrote in a July note to clients.


The drop in 10-year Treasury yields this year? Sadoff Investment called out a 23.5% drop from a 2.72% yield on March 4 to 2.08% on June 3. "Close enough!" Bryan, Michael and Ronald Sadoff said.


On Monday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond ended at 2.03%, 18 basis points below the 2.21% yield for 3-month T-bills. On Jan. 2, they stood at 2.66% and 2.42%, respectively.

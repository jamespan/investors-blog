The stock market rally took a step backward Monday, as the Dow Jones industrials fell more than 100 points. Tech stocks — represented by the Nasdaq — fell sharply, led lower by a key downgrade on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock. The weak action — paired with higher volume — added a distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the trading session with a 0.8% decline, its largest decline since June 25 when the Nasdaq fell 1.5%. The other major stock indexes fared a bit better. The S&P 500 declined 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 116 points, or 0.4%. All three major indexes closed modestly off their lows.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP_3x2_070519-264x300.jpg)The small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.9% decline. Small-cap stocks often are viewed as higher-risk investments, and their weak performance was worth noting relative to the modest losses of the Dow 30 and S&P 500.


Volume on the Nasdaq was higher compared with Friday's trading. Preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume as well.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq with a modest 0.4% fall amid sharply mixed action on the list. Weakness in top Chinese stocks more than offset the strength in the software and retail sectors.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


Monday's action added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The Nasdaq has three distribution days. While Monday's action certainly wasn't ideal, two or three distribution days isn't entirely concerning since the stock market never goes straight up. However, if distribution days begin to cluster or continue to mount, then further weakness could be on the horizon.


Another insightful way to analyze the current market is to check the action among the top growth stocks. If high-quality stocks are breaking down through their key support levels in heavy volume, then the stock market could be deteriorating. Instead, Monday showed some positive action with several high-profile breakouts.


The current stock market rally barely paused Friday and hit a minor speed bump Monday. The stock market remains just off record highs — the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 notched fresh highs last week. While indexes are nearing record highs, they are around levels where they met sellers in the past. The 2950 level is one to watch for the S&P 500, although the index is now above that. For the Nasdaq, 8176 is the price to watch, and the S&P is just above it.


Apple Stock Downgrade Sparks Tech-Driven Losses
-----------------------------------------------



[Dow Jones stock](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) Apple was downgraded from neutral to sell at Rosenblatt Securities early Monday. The analyst sees "fundamental deterioration over the next six to 12 month."


Apple stock slid more than 2%, but is still within striking distance of a 215.41 buy point in a deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). The handle itself is 21% deep, and could be interpreted as a separate base. Shares are still holding above their 50-day moving average line. The iPhone maker's RS line is lagging.


Chinese Stock Leaders Fall, But Roku Gains 6%
---------------------------------------------



Chinese stocks were among the day's losers Monday, as the Shanghai Composite sold off 2.6%. Large-cap Chinese stock **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) fell 2.8%, while **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) moved down 1.5%. Within the IBD 50 growth stock list, Chinese leaders **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) were among the day's losers. Baozun remains extended beyond a 49.20 cup-base entry despite a 2.5% fall.


New Oriental Education, meanwhile, triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from the 98.09 buy point in a cup base after Monday's 5.1% swoon. Shares closed at 90.99.


Elsewhere, **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) all notched solid gains in the face of the stock market decline. Roku gained 5.2% after finding support at its 50-day line last week.


Shopify moved up 2.3%, Lululemon gained 2% and Twilio added 3.2%.


Top Stocks Nears Buy Points: Chegg, Chipotle, Epam Systems
----------------------------------------------------------



Despite a weak overall day in the stock market, IBD 50 stock **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) broke out past a 180.65 entry in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 2.5% advance. The stock's bullish move propelled it into the 5% buy zone that tops out at 189.68. Epam Systems was featured on [Friday's Sector Leader column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/stocks-to-watch-epam-systems-breakout-stock-buy-point/) and was one of the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-epam-stock-wrestles-buy-point/) last week. The stock was also added to IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


On a positive note, Epam's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is nearing a new high. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Investors use the RS line to find stocks that are beating the general market and can be potential stock market winners.


The [No. 1-ranked education stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chegg-inc-chgg.aspx) **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) proved its mettle Monday, [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-analysis/growth-stocks-to-watch-chegg-among-todays-fastest-growing-companies/) past a 41.79 buy point in heavy turnover. Shares gained 5.5% to close at 42.79. The 5% buy zone runs up to 43.88.


Lastly, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) cleared a 749.35 three-week-tight buy point in early trade. Shares trimmed gains to close with a 1.25% gain, ending just below the entry.

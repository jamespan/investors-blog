The major indexes surged Tuesday, in what amounted to a favorable change for the market's outlook.


The Nasdaq roared 2% -- its best day since March 1 -- fueled by chip, software and other technology sectors. The S&P 500 added 1.4% and had its best outing since March 11.


Participation was broad, as the small-cap Russell 2000 added 2.2% and the Dow utilities climbed 1.1%. Winners beat losers by nearly 10 to 3 on the NYSE and 7 to 2 on the Nasdaq. Volume rose.


The combination of ample index gains and higher volume showed that institutional investors were busy diving back into stocks. Indexes had weakened as signs emerged that an interest-rate increase could occur as early as June. Now, those worries have taken a back seat, even as more Fed officials echoed that possibility this week.


![MP052416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP052416-155x300.jpg)Tuesday's rally caused a change in IBD's market outlook back to confirmed uptrend. The uptrend had been termed under pressure due to a sluggish performance and a buildup of distribution days.


The April 19 distribution day on the Nasdaq is now too dated to be relevant to the current market. Still, that leaves the Nasdaq and S&P 500 with an elevated level of heavy institutional selling.


That's the counterpoint to Tuesday's bullish action. While a confirmed uptrend should mean increased exposure to stocks, investors must remain cautious before getting into deeper waters.  There have been false starts, such as the Nasdaq's May 6-10 rally, which ended abruptly at the composite's 50-day moving average.


Tuesday, however, the Nasdaq climbed back above its converged 50-day and 200-day lines, while the S&P 500 moved back above its own 50-day average. That signal was a factor in deciding to change IBD's outlook.


There was no major news to explain Tuesday's big advance. So perhaps there really was honest buying rather than headline-driven portfolio moves. Last week, there was a bottoming sign when the put-call volume ratio spiked to a level that often has marked at least short-term lows.


U.S. indexes followed strong gains in Europe. The DAX climbed 2.2%, the CAC 40 was up 2.5% and the FTSE 100 rose 1.4%. News of improvement in a German economic forecast and a poll showing support for Britain staying in the eurozone seemed to boost markets.


The next ingredient that market bulls need is a better performance by growth stocks, which have built a reputation for lagging the market too often. Dozens of otherwise strong stocks have stalled after rising above buy points.


**TransDigm Group** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) was an example, as the aerospace components maker surged May 10 on strong quarterly results, only to go sideways afterward. On Tuesday, however, the stock jumped 2% to a new high in above-average volume after it announced the $1 billion acquisition of an aerospace and industrial devices maker from a private equity firm.


In other signs that growth shares might finally start to outperform, **BroadSoft** ([BSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSFT)),  **Cadence Design** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) and **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) made new highs in active trading.


The IBD 50 climbed 2.3% Tuesday. All but one of the 50 components closed higher. **Blue Buffalo** ([BUFF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUFF)) edged lower by just 13 cents.


No sector seemed to have a better day than building. It started with the April report on [new-home sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/new-home-sales-in-u-s-surge-to-highest-level-in-eight-years/), which vaulted 16.6% to the highest level in eight years. Then, luxury-home builder **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) beat earnings and sales expectations and saw a bullish outlook. Shares climbed nearly 9% in huge volume.


While most homebuilders remain far below 52-week highs, makers of cabinets, flooring, wallboard, appliances and other construction-related products have been rallying for a while. Several appeared in Tuesday's Stocks On The Move.


**A.O. Smith** ([AOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOS)), an IBD 50 member, climbed back above the 81.25 buy point of a cup-type base.

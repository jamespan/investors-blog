Stock Market Rallies In Relief Over Fed Chief Powell's Inflation Stance; These Industries Wallop Bears
=======================================================================================================

The stock market had already seemed to price in Wednesday's news that the Federal Reserve would stage a second increase in interest rates by half a percentage point in less than three months. In fact, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell.




But investors perhaps did not expect Fed chief Jerome Powell to remain confident that inflation, after reaching four-decade highs, is going to cool off later this year.


[Powell's view](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-begins-two-fisted-tightening-dow-jones-volatile/), expressed during a news conference after the 2 p.m. ET news release, gave the stock market's budding rally much needed steam.


As noted in the Big Picture on Monday, the Nasdaq has delivered a few positive reversals — meaning it turned early losses into gains. And Wednesday's reversal certainly qualifies as one of the best in weeks, if not months. Going from a morning drop of as much as 1.6% before the news, the composite index finished up 3.2%.


Stock Market Today: Large Caps Lead
-----------------------------------


The S&P 500 surged 3%. Smaller issues lagged a bit, but still ended near session highs. The Russell 2000 gained 2.7% and the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rose 2.8%. Volume bulged on both main stock market exchanges, meaning equity trading desks bought with abandon.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP050422-259x300.jpg)The yield on the key 10-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 2.91%.


The Fed news included a decision to begin letting Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed agency debt [securities owned by the U.S. central bank mature in June](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-begins-two-fisted-tightening-dow-jones-volatile/) and not reinvest the cash returned. With almost $9 trillion in such assets on the Fed's balance sheet, this asset runoff could accelerate to as much as $95 billion per month by year's end. Yet even at that rate, it would take years for the Federal Reserve to remove just half of that mighty sum.


Meanwhile, the CME's FedWatch tool on fed funds rate futures showed a drop in the probability of the Fed raising short-term interest rates by 75 basis points, from 1% to 1.75% at the next meeting in June. Before the day began, that probability stood at 95%. By day's end, that figure sank to 76%.


Even after Wednesday's lion-like jump following April's big washout, the market has yet to signal that a tradable rally has truly begun.


"Inflation may well peak in the coming months, but the broadening and intensification of price pressures imply that inflation will decline very gradually," Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, commented in an email sent to IBD. "We expect it to settle around 5% by year-end — more than double the Fed's target. So, the Fed will need to look beyond simmering growth risks, and instead remain sharply focused on its inflation fight."


Meanwhile, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, noted that the unanimous decision among the FOMC members to lift the fed funds rate by 50 basis points on Wednesday to 1% is actually meaningful. Why? Roach said that St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard "did not dissent with a vote for a higher increase like he had intimated. Reading between the lines, I see this as net positive for markets."


Plus, both the Fed and IBD readers need to stay mindful of recession risk. Investors are also eyeing China's Covid-19 lockdowns of major cities and energy supply crunches created by Russia's war on Ukraine.


Focusing On The Nasdaq
----------------------



Look at a daily chart, and you'll see that the Nasdaq, at 12,964, now has hoisted itself back above the March near-term low of 12,555.


The S&P 500 shook out fragile holders in similar form in recent days. But on Wednesday, the large-cap benchmark made its first three-day rally in nearly five weeks. Wednesday's solid gain to 4300 pushed the S&P 500 to less than 11% off its all-time peak of 4818.


Leading industry groups in the stock market included computer hardware and peripherals (up 8.4% on a price-weighted basis), solar and alcoholic beverages (up 7.5% each) and funeral services (6%). Also in the stock market Wednesday, electrical power equipment, wood products and oil machinery each climbed at least 5%.


Breadth improved. On ThinkOrSwim, winners outnumbered losers on the Nasdaq by a 5-2 margin and by more than a 4-1 ratio on the NYSE. (Go to the General Market Indicator link at the bottom of each day's Big Picture column to see final figures.)


This of course, doesn't mean that many high-quality growth stocks are on the verge of breaking out.

Will Mr. Softy Remain A Stock Market Leader?
--------------------------------------------


Case in point: Long-Term Leader **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Fresh off another impressive quarter of steady top and bottom-line growth (March-quarter earnings per share up 14%, sales up 18%), the enterprise software, gaming and cloud computing titan underperformed the Nasdaq and the 500 by only a tiny margin. Yet a 2.9% gain still does not bring shares back above key moving averages.



From early January to March, Microsoft closed beneath its 10-week moving average for 10 weeks in a row. That's an unusually long time for a correction, especially among true market leaders. In March, the megacap in the stock market rallied again. But it did not spend much time above 300, a key price level. Watch on a weekly chart how many weeks it spends beneath the still-falling 10-week line.


Wednesday's [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) table highlighted both leaders rising and laggards taking big hits.


**Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) plunged 29% as volume exploded to 111 million shares. On a typical session, the stock sees 5.8 million shares exchange hands. The ride-share innovator reported earnings in the first quarter of 7 cents a share vs. a net loss of 35 cents a year earlier. Revenue grew at a 44% clip. That's nice, but decelerated from year-over-year increases of 125%, 73% and 70% in the prior three periods.


Most importantly, Lyft's recent price action shows why you do not chase stock market laggards on the way down.



Small cap **LSB Industries** ([LXU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LXU)) undercut its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since its latest breakout in February. The maker of fertilizers and industrial chemicals did bounce off its session low of 19.02, but still dropped 10%. Volume of 1.71 million shares hit the highest level for a down day since the start of the move. This hinted some fund managers unloaded stock in a big way.

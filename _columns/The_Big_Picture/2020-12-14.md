U.S. stocks saw their best gains Monday in the first half-hour of trading. After that, indexes went separate ways, with the Nasdaq composite besting the S&P 500.




Gains were concentrated in growth and technology stocks. The S&P technology sector led with a 0.3% increase after shedding 1.4% last week. Semiconductor, software and some internet industry groups outperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose 0.3%.


Chips in particular continued to set the pace. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 1.2% Monday and is up nearly 50% for the year.


With biotechs and solar power stocks also acting relatively better, the Nasdaq climbed 0.5%.

The Nasdaq 100 — which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the composite and is the basis for the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) — rallied 0.7%.


But the rest of the U.S. stock market was noticeably softer. Cyclical sectors such as transportation, industrials, energy and materials were the weakest.


The S&P 500 erased a 0.9% gain and reversed, ending 0.4% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stumbled 0.6% because all but a few of its components closed lower. All three major indexes closed near session lows.


Bearish Trend For U.S. Stocks?
------------------------------


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. The increase in NYSE trading translated to a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500, which has piled up five such days of higher-volume losses.


With that many distribution days, you can start making a case that the market trend is turning bearish. But that doesn't tell the whole story. The Nasdaq is still pretty clean of distribution, and most top-rated stocks continue to act well. Among those that have broken out of bases the past several weeks, nearly all remain above buy points.


Among Monday's breakouts, none was more impressive than **Sterling Construction** ([STRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRL)). Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume. The heavy construction stock was discussed last week in [IBD's Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/construction-stock-142-run-near-buy-point-building-bullish-base/).


**Calix** ([CALX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALX)) was another noteworthy breakout. Shares topped the 27.88 buy point of a base-on-base formation. Volume was heavy in the broadband provider's stock.


The IBD 50 — a good benchmark for growth leaders — climbed 1% Monday. Thirty-three components rose, in another sign that growth was in favor.


Small caps also faded, closing only 0.1% higher on the Russell 2000. Small caps are the new leaders of the U.S. stock market. The Russell 2000 is mounting a late-year rally. Since the market lows of Oct. 30, the Russell 2000 is up some 24%, beating the S&P 500's gain of about 11.5% and the Nasdaq's approximately 14% increase.


Coronavirus, Policy Risks For Market
------------------------------------


Market risks are largely focused on policymaking and the Covid-19 pandemic.


In Congress, there is still no agreement on a new coronavirus stimulus package. The stalemate has dragged on since well before the November elections.


Coronavirus contagions are stressing hospitals and other health care providers. Lockdown measures raise worries about the economy. On Monday, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio warned of a "full shutdown" that may be put in place.


Inoculations began Monday for the new Covid-19 vaccine from **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), a landmark moment in the pandemic's history. Yet, those shares sold off. Pfizer fell nearly 5% and BioNTech plunged 15%.

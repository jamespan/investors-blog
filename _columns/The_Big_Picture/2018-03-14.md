Ten Years Ago, Wall Street Crushed Itself; How Is The Stock Market Today?
==========================================================================

Ten years ago on this date, Wall Street presented investors with a real bear of a problem.




Bear Stearns, the legendary investment house, waved the white flag and its assets got swallowed up by **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) for pennies on the dollar. The reason: too much bad debt in the arena of low-quality mortgage-backed speculative instruments. The year 2008 later became one of the most historic market corrections in U.S. history as banks essentially stopped acting as counterparties for loans.


Some banks quickly changed their charters to receive federal assistance and survive.


With massive help from the Federal Reserve, most of Wall Street's kingpins managed to live. (Remember WaMu, Wachovia, Merrill Lynch, Lehman? All of them went bankrupt or got folded into their competitors.) And on Wednesday, the financial sector continues to be a leading force in the current bull run that has just entered Year 10 since the bottom in 2009.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP_3x6_031418-231x300.png)Stocks showed lumpy action as cyclicals and blue chips bore the brunt of selling. But tech, internet and select growth stocks didn't do so badly.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.6% for a second straight session and volume on the NYSE accelerated. This negative price-and-volume action translates into a second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), raising the total for the large-cap benchmark to six over the past 25 sessions.


At least in terms of time, the S&P 500 won't see a reduction in its distribution count until at least March 27.


The Dow Jones industrials — smacked by big drops in **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) (down 8 points) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) (off 4 points) — sank 1%. That decline sharpened the contrast with the outperformance of the Nasdaq composite, which fell less than 0.2%.


Nasdaq volume fell, indicating a lack of urgency among mutual funds, banks and other institutional investors to dump shares.


Want more evidence that top-flight growth stocks did pretty well, relatively speaking? The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund lost just one penny. At 34.67, the fund is up 4.4% since Jan. 1 following its 37% jump in 2017.


And in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), eight of the 11 current members gained for the day. (All of the 11 stocks have annotations on their daily and weekly charts to pinpoint correct buy and sell points. Ditto for the top 10 names in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and all 16 names currently in [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders).)


Six distribution days are certainly on the heavy side for the S&P 500, and all six sell-offs showed some teeth. The smallest drop among these declines was 0.5% on Feb. 20, the biggest 1.3% (on both Feb. 27 and March 1). Compared with 2017, volatility is certainly up. The possibility of retaliation by U.S. trading partners seemed to be front-and-center in investors' minds. On Wednesday, plastics, steel and automaker shares paced the decline with drops of 2% or more.


Railroads fell 1.7% as a group. Airlines also fell hard. The Dow transports got hammered 1.7%.


Yet the S&P 500 finished just above the 50-day moving average, and it's only 4% off its all-time peak.


Meanwhile, will 7500 become a floor of support for the Nasdaq?


In January, it proved to be a hard ceiling to crack. In early February, sellers dominated the show and the Nasdaq needed just a few weeks to skid nearly 12% from its all-time peak of 7505. But strength in the internet, computer, semiconductor and software sectors certainly give the Nasdaq a chance to be the leading index again in 2018.


Among the dozen or so industry groups that rose 1% or more on Wednesday were internet content, computer networking, educational software, database software, travel booking and movies.


How about the banks?


Investors can quickly get a grip on the state of the sector by taking a few easy steps.


One, check out the stock research tables, which are arranged by top-performing sectors first in terms of mid- and long-term relative price performance and cellar dwellers last.


Through Wednesday's close, the tables show the Banks ranking a measly [No. 20 out of 33 sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-mar-14-2018/). However, the year-to-date performance is decent, up nearly 4.6%. The S&P 500, finishing the day at 2749, is up 2.9%.


Goldman, part of the Banks sector, doesn't look the way it did in the fall of 2008, when the stock eventually plummeted to an all-time low of 47.41, 81% below its October 2007 peak of 250.70. Yet a 65 Composite Rating and a 60 Earnings Per Share Rating brings more yawns than bolts of inspiration and awe.


The better performing sector? Finance. It ranks a much healthier 8th out of 33. Click on "Finance" within the rankings, and you'll see no fewer than 18 names that are highlighted for having gone public within the past 15 years and ranking at least an 80 for both EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings.


One of those names, **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), has been showcased in [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) in recent months. The fuel card innovator for the trucking industry is forming a new base that is shallow enough to qualify as a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), yet so far has the look of an emerging cup pattern. **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), an innovator in digital payments, recently joined [Swing Trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).


Two, check the stocks showing the most strength — i.e., the ones making new highs.


In Wednesday's [New High list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-mar-14-2018/), Finance ranked No. 3 in terms of those sectors contributing the largest number of stocks making 52-week or all-time highs.


"Today, things are more solid," Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in note to clients. "First, banks are required to hold more capital, which is to say they are less leveraged and have a stronger financial foundation. As such, in a crisis, other banks are more likely to keep lending because they know there is a solid base of assets to back up any loan they make."


McMillan also points out that banks now own fewer trading assets and "so are less exposed to any declines—even if they are large. The combination of a more financially secure institution with less risk exposure means a Bear Stearns moment is materially less likely today."


Are small caps starting to perk up? IBD's Small Cap Growth Funds Vs. Big Cap Growth Funds graph, seen in the latest IBD Weekly on Page A11, is rising in March after flattening out in February.


The S&P 600 lost 0.5% on Wednesday and is up 3% since Jan. 1, holding a slim 20 basis-point edge over the 500.

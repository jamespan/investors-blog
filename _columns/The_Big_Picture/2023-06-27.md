========================================================================================

The stock market flexed its muscles as it made a strong upward move Tuesday, buoyed by positive economic data. Growth stocks had a particularly good session while airline plays soared on sunny guidance from **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)).




The show of strength after the recent pullback was encouraging. The Nasdaq composite ended the day with a meaty 1.7% gain. The tech-heavy index powered up from its 21-day exponential moving average and closed just shy of the 10-day line.


The S&P 500 turned in a 1.2% gain and also bounced away from its 21-day line. Moving decisively back above the 10-day moving average will be its next task.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both main exchanges, a sign of bullish sentiment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the weakest performer among the major indexes despite a 0.6% gain. A disastrous day for **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) weighed, with the stock falling more than 9% after management slashed guidance amid waning demand for Covid-19 vaccines. This overshadowed solid sessions from the likes of **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Small caps regained some recent ground lost to the bears, with the Russell 2000 popping 1.5%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) now sits near a first-stage cup-with-handle entry of 189.24, [MarketSmith analysis shows.](https://marketsmith.investors.com/)

The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) popped 2.6% for the day and is now up almost 14% for the year.


With the market still in a confirmed uptrend, IBD recommends 60% to 80% exposure for now. Be sure to continue seeking actionable stocks while also keeping a tight grip on any sell signals in your portfolio.


Data Boosts Stock Market; Hurdles Loom
--------------------------------------


A battery of positive economic data helped to push stocks higher. New orders for durable goods vaulted 1.7% in May after April's revised 1.2% increase, while shipments of manufactured goods jumped 1.7% after dipping 0.6% in April.


Perhaps most important of all was the Conference Board's consumer confidence report. The index spiked 7.2 points to 109.7, its highest reading since January 2022.


"The strong consumer confidence report will likely suggest expectations are not for the labor market to deteriorate quickly, which should confirm expectations that a recession will not happen this year, but most likely next," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients.


Nevertheless, the latest Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is due Friday. This, particularly the core measurement, is the Fed's favored inflation gauge. A surprise here could help propel the markets higher or send them lower.


Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also appearing at a policy panel discussion at the European Central Bank Forum in Portugal Wednesday. Fedspeak always has the potential to move markets.

Delta Stock Boosts Airlines
---------------------------


Nearly all S&P 500 sectors of the stock market ended the session in the green Tuesday, with only health care losing ground. Consumer discretionary and technology were the top performers.


Despite this, it was no surprise that airlines were one of the best performing IBD industry groups Tuesday, rising 5.1%.



The group was boosted after Delta Air Lines surged 6.8% after guiding full-year EPS of $6. This was near the top of its previously forecast range, with CEO Ed Bastian telling CNBC that demand is "off the chain."


Other airline stocks also got a lift in the stock market. **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) popped 5.5% and broke out of a cup-with-handle base. **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) rose 5.1%. UAL was Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/united-airlines-stock-flies-past-buy-point-on-rival-industry-guidance/) after it cleared a 54.05 buy point in strong volume.


Other groups that had strong sessions included specialty consumer plays, integrated telecom services, trucking companies and department stores.


On the downside, drugstores, periodicals, biotechs and medical research equipment all lagged.

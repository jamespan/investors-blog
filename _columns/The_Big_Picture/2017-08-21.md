Stocks End Quietly Mixed, But IBD 50 Outperforms Again
=======================================================

Major stock indexes turned in a reasonable performance Monday, ending mixed and mostly unchanged, as several China-based stocks once again turned in impressive performances.




The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average both rose 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite eased less than 0.1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE, but volume was skewed a bit Friday by options expirations.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index fell in line with the Nasdaq after giving up longer-term support at the 200-day moving average last week.


As the debate rages on about where the market is headed, the bulls have reasons to be optimistic, but the bear case isn't a bad one, either.


Nine distribution days for the Nasdaq are reason enough to be very cautious with new buys. Yes, technical setups are out there that could yield breakouts, but it's been a mixed environment for breakouts amid uneven buying from the institutional crowd.

The downward slope of the Nasdaq's advance-decline line is sharper now than it was during prior pullbacks for the Nasdaq to the 50-day moving average.


Mix in some geopolitical risk, and it's not hard to see the bear argument.


The bull case, meanwhile, is strengthened by a market-friendly Fed and interest rates that are likely to stay low for a while. If the Fed's projections pan out (three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018), the Fed funds rate could be at 1.75%-2% by the end of next year, still low by historical standards.


And did you catch last week's performance by the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) index of leading growth stocks; up 1.3% compared with weekly losses of 0.6% to 0.7% for the Nasdaq and S&P 500? That's another feather in the bulls' cap. In the early stages of a market pullback, leading growth stocks are usually breaking down, not outperforming. The IBD 50 outperformed again Monday, rising 0.3%.


It's a quiet week of economic data, but the Federal Reserve's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., takes place later in the week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi are scheduled to speak Friday.


The Fed is forecasting one more rate hike before the end of the year and three in 2018. Just recently, though, the CME Group FedWatch tool had the chances at less than 50% of one more rate hike before the end of the year. Now, it's slightly more than 60%. The Fed is also expected to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by selling bonds, perhaps as early as the September meeting. That should give  interest rates a lift.


China based **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)), one of two China-based names in IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) at Investors.com, soared 20% to 64.14. Adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share more than tripled the consensus estimate. Sales also smashed expectations, rising 31% to $382.5 million.


58.com operates an online marketplace for classified ads, similar to Craig's List in the U.S. It is one of many China internet names benefiting from booming traffic in the world's second-largest economy.


China-based Nasdaq 100 names also outperformed, including **Ctrip.com** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)).


Copper prices rose again, helping the cause of **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), which rose 4% to 14.73. It's not far from a cup-with-handle buy point of 15.37.


In M&A news, **Sempra Energy** ([SRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRE)) agreed to acquire privately-held power transmission firm Oncor for $9.45 billion in cash, trumping an earlier bid last month from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for $9 billion. Sempra cleared a 117.69 buy point on the news, rising 1.6% to 118.40.

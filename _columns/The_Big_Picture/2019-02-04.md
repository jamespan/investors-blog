Price action proved relatively quiet in the Dow Jones and S&P 500 Monday, but it was a different story in the technology sector. In [stock market news](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) Monday, tech stocks outperformed by a wide margin. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) was a top gainer in the Dow Jones, while **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100.




Top-performing growth stocks in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) also did well, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 0.8%. Big gainers in the IBD 50 Monday included **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).


The Nasdaq composite ended with a gain of almost 1.2%. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 added 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index picked up 1%. The iShares Russell 200 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) closed at its session high. Volume was very heavy in the exchange traded fund during the final hour of trading.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Friday's levels.

Stock Market News: Uptrend Intact
---------------------------------


Clearly, there's a lot to like about the latest uptrend that was confirmed by the S&P 500 in early January. There's been no shortage of top-rated growth stocks breaking out to new highs.


That breakouts are working shouldn't come as a big surprise. Small-cap, midcap and large-cap stocks have all been showing strength thanks to scant signs of institutional selling in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since the Jan. 4 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/). The only [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the count at this point are stalling sessions for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite on Jan. 16.


In the small-cap space, IBD 50 stock **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) broke out to an all-time high Monday, rising nearly 6% in heavy volume. [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com) **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), a midcap stock, continued its rapid ascent, rising 1%. And in the large-cap space, **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)) showed bullish technical action, gapping above its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.


Be careful not to get too complacent. At some point, distribution days will start to appear in the indexes. But it usually takes a lot of them to derail a market uptrend, and there's no reason to think they're right around the corner. It still makes sense looking for actionable technical setups to buy.


Worries about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes are on the back burner for now. So are concerns about a possible recession for the U.S. economy. But China trade-war headlines remain fluid, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are approaching possible resistance levels.


The S&P 500 is within striking distance of its 200-day moving average, near 2742. The Nasdaq is also approaching its 200-day line, currently around 7453. If more institutional money continues to come in from the sidelines, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shouldn't have much trouble taking out these key price levels.


Stock Market News: Tech Gainers
-------------------------------


The Nasdaq 100 served up plenty of strong movers, including **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)). Shares jumped 3% to 254.74. The longtime software leader broke out over a trend line, found by connecting the stock's recent highs, but volume was below average. Still, Adobe showed bullish technical action by clearing resistance at 150.


Adobe has recently joined the [watch list of Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist), and so its daily and weekly charts show annotations that give further color on buy points, sell signals and notable action.


After some earnings volatility last week, Dow stock and Nasdaq 100 titan Microsoft reclaimed its 50-day moving average as it works on a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 108 buy point. Shares rose nearly 3% to 105.74 in light volume.



Software stocks outperformed again Monday, something they've been doing a lot of lately.


Shares of **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)) soared nearly 20% on news the company is being taken private by a group of investors led by Hellman & Friedman. The deal, worth about $11 billion, values Ultimate at 331.50 per share.


Enterprise software stocks like Ultimate Software have been leading the market for some time. It's one of the few areas in the stock market where there's earnings visibility. Not only do several leading enterprise software stocks show huge earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, but strong growth is expected in coming quarters as well.


The enterprise software group rose more than 3% Monday on the heels of a 4% gain last week. It's working on its seventh straight weekly price gain.



Trade Desk topped a 149.10 [double-bottom entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), rising 4% to 151.67 in decent volume.


Elsewhere, **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) touched an all-time high ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close. It cleared a conventional entry of 131.92, but gains faded by the close. It ended slightly above the buy point in average volume.

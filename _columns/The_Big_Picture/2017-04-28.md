U.S. stock indexes kept most of their gains from early in the week, protecting the Nasdaq's best weekly advance since early January.


The Nasdaq was flat Friday, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each lost about 0.2%.


Volume climbed on the Nasdaq. According to preliminary data, NYSE volume fell.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP042817-169x300.png)For the week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively. The Nasdaq's gain was the best in 16 weeks.


The technical picture improved during the week. Consider:


— IBD's market outlook shifted from under pressure to confirmed uptrend.


— New highs zoomed to the highest levels in weeks.


— Rising volume accompanied the week's two strong up days.


Each of these factors point to improvements, but a look at industry groups reveals some mixed situations. The so-called Trump trade is one of the mixed situations.


For example, the cement group has risen in four of the past five weeks. The group chart looks like it established a bottom in late March and is building the right side. **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) set a high in November. The stock declined to 21% off its high but now is only 12% off the high.


Many of the best-gaining groups or sectors have nothing to do with President Trump's November win.


Chip stocks have been in the top three among 33 sectors since early March. But recently chips have shown signs of slowing.


The chip designer group has been in a trough all year and is up only 3% for the year. (The Nasdaq is up about 12%.)


The chip manufacturing group has been moving sideways since mid-March. An attempt to clear the pattern failed in the most recent week. For the year, chipmakers are up 9% but very recently were up almost 14%.


The chip equipment group has the best-looking chart of the three chip groups. Chip equipment is up 30%.


In economic news, first-quarter GDP came in at 0.7%, under views and matching the most pessimistic estimate in the range.


**Coming up**: The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, but an interest-rate hike is not expected until June.


Key companies reporting in the coming week include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)).

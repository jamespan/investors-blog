Sometimes, distribution days in the stock market can be middling and on the fence. Other times, they're more pronounced.




It was definitely the latter Wednesday, at least on the S&P 500, as the stock market ended with sharp losses amid a spike in new [coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) cases across the U.S. No doubt there's still a lot of uncertainty about the spread of the virus and what impact it will have on an economic recovery for the U.S. Market sentiment was also negative on reports that the U.S. is considering tariffs on goods from Europe.


New York, New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday said they would quarantine visitors from coronavirus hot spots for 14 days. Hot spots include California, Texas, Florida and Arizona. New cases also spiked Tuesday in Louisiana and Georgia.


The Nasdaq composite snapped an eight-session win streak, falling 2.2%. It gave up the 10,000 level but held above its 10-day moving average. The Nasdaq avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) because volume came in lower than Tuesday.



Leading growth stocks held their own, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) falling in line with the Nasdaq, down 2.2%.


The S&P 500 lost 2.6% and closed just above its 200-day moving average. The index was weighed down by double-digit percentage declines in **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)), **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) and **Royal Caribbean Cruises** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)), as well as broad-based weakness in oil and gas stocks. A distribution day was added for the S&P 500 because volume on the NYSE came in higher than Tuesday.


Crude Oil Slumps
----------------


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $38.01 a barrel, down 5.9%, after the Energy Information Administration said [weekly crude stockpiles](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-coroanvirus-cases-surge-eu-tariffs-us-crude-stockpiles/) rose by 1.44 million barrels, the third straight weekly gain. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expected a 100,000-barrel decline in crude supplies. The EIA also said crude production jumped to 11 million barrels per day from 10.5 million in the prior week, the first increase in more than three months.

The Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 3.4%. But it wasn't a fearful market at all as the put-call volume ratio registered a lukewarm reading of 0.86. Excessively fearful readings of 1.15 or higher have been seen near market bottoms in the past.


All 11 S&P 500 sector ETFs ended lower. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)), Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) led the downside with losses of more than 3%.


Money flowed into bonds, but the 10-year yield didn't move much, down 3 basis points to 0.68%.


Stock Market Today: Nasdaq Holds Above Key Support Level
--------------------------------------------------------


The silver lining to Wednesday's session is that the Nasdaq held above its 10-day average. When the Nasdaq plunged 5.3% on June 11, it ultimately held support at the 21-day line.


Before the open, the International Monetary Fund predicted a 4.9% contraction in global gross domestic product this year. That's a downgrade from a prior forecast of -3%. The IMF expects GDP growth in the U.S. to contract by 8% this year, with the eurozone contracting by 10.2%.

Wednesday's distribution day for the S&P 500 came after the Nasdaq showed [stalling-type action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) Tuesday. The Nasdaq's percentage gain prevented it from being a true stalling session, but the index closed near its lows in higher volume, so it definitely had the feel of it. The Nasdaq showed classic stalling action on Friday. Since June 3, every up day for the Nasdaq has come in above-average volume. But after Wednesday's haircut, the Nasdaq's gain from June 3 is only 2.3%.


Bullish Sentiment Rises
-----------------------


Thursday's losses came amid a rise in bullish sentiment from Investors Intelligence. The weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed the bulls at 57.3%, up from 54.9% the prior week. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


Excessive bullish has been see near market tops in the past, while bearishness has been seen at near market bottoms. Bulls above 55% call for defensive measures, including taking partial profits in big gainers. The bulls hit 59.4% in the second half of January just before a sharp correction for the stock market in February.


Once again, though, the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) showed little in the way of sell signals from market-leading growth stocks. None of the 21 top stocks on Leaderboard was in any real danger. Thirteen stocks on the list ended with losses of at least 2%, but big market leaders like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) closed nicely above their 10-day lines.

The stock market reversed lower after a quiet start Monday, but recovered off lows to end with modest losses.


All in all, it was a constructive performance. The Nasdaq pared a 0.7% loss to 0.3% after touching another all-time high in the morning. The S&P 500 eased 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Volume on the Nasdaq was slightly lower than Friday. NYSE volume rose a bit, according to preliminary data.


Money flowed into bonds as the 10-year Treasury yield sagged 7 basis points to 2.32%. Late last year, the 10-year yield went over 2.6%.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by more than 2-to-1. The ratio was 5-to-4 on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP040317-175x300.png)Small caps lagged badly, with the Russell 2000 down 1.2%. The index is back below the 50-day moving average after reclaiming the line last week.


Coal, mining stocks and managed care firms outperformed. Several auto-related industry groups lagged.


It was hard to say what exactly fueled the morning downdraft, but Wall Street had several headlines to ponder, including mostly in-line manufacturing data, a new IBD/TIPP poll that showed waning support for President Trump and disappointing monthly auto sales.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a bright spot in IBD's automaker group after the company reported better-than-expected vehicle deliveries in the first quarter. Shares vaulted 7% to 298.52. It staged a bullish breakout from cup-shaped base with a 287.49 buy point. Other names in the group like **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) and **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) weren't so lucky, with losses ranging from 2% to 5%. Their sales  for March [came in below views or declined](https://www.investors.com/news/ford-u-s-auto-sales-fall-gm-inventories-swell/) from a year ago.



Casino operators like **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) and **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) did well early but ceded those gains despite strong data from Macau, where both firms have a strong presence. Shares of Wynn added 1.5%, after rising 4.5% early. Las Vegas Sands added 0.2% after gaining 2.5% early. **Melco Crown Entertainment** ([MPEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPEL)) ended near its high, rising 2% to 18.97. It's holding just above a prior 18.37 buy point.


Other intriguing setups at the moment included **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)), which is carving a flat base with a 73.18 buy point. Recent IPO **MuleSoft** ([MULE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MULE)) isn't profitable yet, but the software name is working on an IPO base with a 26.02 buy point.


The next potential catalyst for the market? Well, it won't be long before first-quarter earnings reports start to roll in. Results will most likely be strong again among institutional-quality growth stocks, but will it be enough to fuel more gains for the major stock indexes? That depends if there's enough money on the sidelines ready to come in. Several years into a bull market that started in March 2009, it's a widely debated topic at the moment.


With indexes so close to their highs, the assumption would be that the market tide is flowing positive, resulting in a favorable environment to make money in stocks. The Nasdaq rose 1.4% last week, and five new names were added to IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) product. When the market is serving up new buys on a silver platter, it's usually a good time to increase exposure.


But while the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, it's an uptrend under some pressure thanks to a distribution-day count that's getting elevated again. As always, proceed cautiously with new buys, and be sure to cut losses short when a new buy doesn't go as planned.

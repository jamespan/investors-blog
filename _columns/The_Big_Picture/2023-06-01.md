Tech Stocks Lead Stock Market Rally As Tesla Breaks Out; Pivotal Jobs Report Up Next
=====================================================================================

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher Thursday, as EV giant **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) broke out past its latest buy point. Next up, investors will shift their attention to Friday's jobs report




Wall Street economists are forecasting that the [May jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/friday-jobs-report-may-be-a-game-changer-for-the-fed-sp-500/) will show that employer payrolls grew by 180,000, as the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.5%. Average hourly earnings are seen rising 0.3% on the month, as annual wage growth holds at 4.4%. The Labor Department's May jobs report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.


A Federal Reserve rate hike on June 14 [may hinge on Friday's jobs report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-official-says-rate-pause-doesnt-signal-end-to-hikes-758041e5?mod=economy_lead_pos3). If it's much stronger than forecast, interest rates could go up. But as of Thursday evening, markets are pricing in just [22% odds of a quarter-point](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) Fed rate hike to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. That would be the highest since 2001.


The stock market uptrend features a number of leading stocks in or near buy zones, with more added this week. **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) and Tesla broke out this week. Meanwhile, **Extreme Networks** ([EXTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXTR)) is nearing a new entry.


Economic Data, Earnings Movers
------------------------------


ADP's employment report showed May jobs growth of 278,000, much stronger than the expected 160,000, but still down slightly from April's 296,000 number. ADP's report is a precursor to Friday's jobs data from the Labor Department.


Meanwhile, initial jobless claims rose to 232,000, slightly below the 235,000 forecast. Claims totaled 229,000 in the previous week.

The stock had rallied more than 20% this week, but lost a big chunk of it Thursday as AI stock dived more than 13%.


Other key earnings movers included **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)), **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).


CrowdStrike reported April-quarter profit and revenue that topped analyst estimates. CRWD stock slashed losses to 1.6% as growth in a key metric, annual recurring revenue, slowed.


Chewy shares soared 21.5%, while NetApp rallied 8.5% Thursday. Nordstrom stock moved up nearly 5%.


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Salesforce sold off 4.7%, while Veeva shares surged nearly 20%. Also, Okta plunged almost 18% Thursday, triggering the 7%-8% loss rule.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, ending a two-day skid. It rebounded from its long-term 200-day line.


The S&P 500 rallied 1%, closing at its highest level since Aug. 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 1.3%, logging a new 2023 closing high. And the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced more than 1%, snapping a two-day losing streak.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE vs. the prior session. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is still at three, while the S&P 500's count remains at seven.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 1.4%, retaking its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy-drink maker **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) advanced 6.2%, moving out of buy range from a 122.34 buy point. Shares are finally picking up momentum following a May 10 breakout move.


There was broader participation in Thursday's advance, a notable positive. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) rose nearly 0.8% and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) moved up 0.7%.


Advancers topped decliners by 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and about 13-to-5 on the NYSE.


With the Nasdaq at a new closing highs, IBD's recommended market exposure sits at 40%-60%. The composite still looks extended and is testing resistance.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Arista, Extreme
----------------------------------------------



Arista Networks broke out past a 171.54 buy point in a cup base this week, but Wednesday's losses saw the networking leader fall below the entry, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Wait for a decisive retake of the entry before purchasing shares.


[Recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/extr-stock-feisty-extreme-networks-taking-share-from-bigger-cisco-hpe/) Extreme Networks is another maker of computer networking gear. Shares climbed 1.2% Thursday, finishing just below a 21.13 buy point. The stock climbed above a trend line Wednesday.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is at its highest level since January. Remember, the [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500 and is the blue line plotted on every IBD chart.


Asana, Cloudflare, Tesla Break Out
----------------------------------



Asana broke out past a 23.06 buy point in a cup base Wednesday, rallying 7.9% in heavy volume. Shares ended Thursday below the entry following the session's 4.3% drop. Earnings came out after the close, which posed a risk. But late Thursday, ASAN stock moved up nearly 3% in extended trade.


[Recent IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-cybersecurity-leader-cloudflare-is-breaking-out-today/) pick Cloudflare broke out past a 66.30 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) pattern, with strong gains this week. The 5% buy range runs up to 69.62, so the stock is just out of buy range after Thursday's rise.


[Tesla shares](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-quietly-increases-u-s-vehicle-discounts-elon-musk-doesnt-unveil-new-model-3/) advanced 1.8% Thursday, closing below a 207.89 buy point in a cup base after hitting the entry intraday.

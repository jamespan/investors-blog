===================================================

A mild two-day rebound came to an abrupt end Tuesday as the stock market caved under renewed institutional selling.

  

The Nasdaq tumbled 1.5% and closed below its 50-day moving average. Weakness in biotech, chip and other techs contributed to the composite's troubles.

  

Whatever the index had recovered the previous two days, it all essentially vanished by the closing bell. The S&P 500 fell 1.2%. Both main indexes closed at session lows.

  

Volume rose sharply — a clear sign that mutual funds, pensions and other institutional investors dumped shares en masse.

  

For the second time in four days, the Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average. Last time, the composite bounced, just like it had the previous several occasions.

  

So chart readers will be watching for a repeat. The S&P 500 closed near its 50-day, suggesting the market may still be buying on dips.

  

But there are several reasons to be suspicious of a meaningful rebound.

  

The major indexes added another distribution day Tuesday. That's seven for each index, and way more than a robust market should have.

  

An alarming trend of severe declines among leading stocks continued. On Tuesday, **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) collapsed 33% after the network security company missed first-quarter sales expectations and its outlook was below views. The fact that Qualys is a leader in one of the top industry groups was troubling, too.

  

Winners such as **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH))and **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) are rarities these days.

  

Besides the occasional headline that sparks a one-day rally, the leaders haven't been able to make big strides on their own.

  

Meantime, most of the recent breakouts are stalling.

  

**Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)) is typical of this trend. On Tuesday, it topped a 14.90 buy point from a flat base after topping Q1 estimates, but closed nearly 5% off that entry. It finished 4% ahead at 14.21.

  

Of about a dozen stocks in the IBD 50 that have cleared buy points the past few weeks, most remain near or below buy points.

  

Some leaders that broke out months ago now have the luxury of having sizable gains to absorb the weakness — living off the fat, so to speak. Investors should look to those to get through the market bumps. Trying to add stocks to portfolios is much riskier.

  

The IBD 50 slid 1.5% Tuesdayand is now 7% below its peak on March 20.

  

Each time the market has made a low the past many months, the put-call volume ratio has spiked above 1.0. But so far the ratio hasn't climbed so much, leaving bulls without a signal they'd love to have right now.

  

Another key signal could come from the indexes. If they undercut last week's lows, they would break a pattern of higher highs and higher lows.

  

The market's breadth offers some hope. The advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE are trending higher.

  

However, losers led winners Tuesday by about 4-to-1 on the NYSE and 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

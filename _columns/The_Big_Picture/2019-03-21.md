Stocks Gallop Ahead; Is It Time To Take Some Profits?
======================================================

Stock indexes staged a bullish display Thursday, starting with a gap-down loss at the open and then reversing in a strong fashion.




The Nasdaq composite overcame weakness in the biotech space to end up 1.4%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively.


Small caps were strong as the Russell 2000 gained 1.2%.


Volume ran slightly lower on the NYSE and up a bit on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.


The March 7 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the Nasdaq because of price gains.


Nasdaq Overcomes Biogen
-----------------------


Although **Biogen**'s ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) 29% drop rattled the biotech group, the Nasdaq overcame the drag. Like most biotechs, Biogen is listed on the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP032119-239x300.jpg)Biogen announced the failure of its Alzheimer's drug in advanced development. The company canceled the project.


Initially Biogen's big drop appeared to create some sympathy selling in the biomeds. But by the end of the day, seven of the nine biotech stocks in the Nasdaq 100 were up.


Chip Stocks Lead
----------------


Semiconductor stocks were among the day's leaders. Going into Thursday's session, the chip sector was up 19.9% since the start of the year.


A strong sector is of little use to would-be investors if stocks in a strong group are mostly extended. However that isn't the case in the chip sector.


The chip groups feature some stocks that are either approaching a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) or are [in the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).


Chip designer **Semtech** ([SMTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMTC)) is approaching a buy point in a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) [is in its 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/), which stretches to 301.07.


Chipmaker **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) is in a 5% buy zone that reaches to 56.91. **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) is working on a handle in a cup-with-handle consolidation.


Chip equipment maker **KLA Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) cleared a 122.50 buy point Thursday, but volume was weak. The stock remains in a 5% buy zone up to 128.62.


Blue Chips
----------


In the blue chip Dow Jones, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) retook its 200-day line in fast trade. The stock climbed about 3.5%. Apple has notched a gain in nine of the past 10 sessions.


Intel, another blue chip, advanced 1.5%.


**Kimberly-Clark** ([KMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMB)), a dividend aristocrat that pays an annualized [3.4% dividend](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/top-dividend-stock-beats-sp-500-payout/), broke out of a consolidation. The stock cleared a 120.58 buy point, but volume was weak.


In the light of Thursday's strong action, bulls could've thrown a dart at a list of the 197 industry groups and likely hit a winner. Groups rising outnumbered those falling by a roughly 11-to-2 ratio.


What An Investor Should Do Now
------------------------------


Consider selling into strength. As financier Bernard Baruch said, "I made my money by selling too soon."


The market has made strong gains since Christmas and since the March lows. An investor might do well to examine possible sells in certain situations including: taking profits that reach 20%; lightening on stocks that haven't done much post-purchase; selling any gainer that threatens to turn into a loss; and selling any stock that drops 7% to 8% from its buy price.


As always, examine any possible purchases with stringent criteria.


Investors in exchange traded funds should also be aware of profit-taking possibilities. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is up 33% since the Christmas Eve low. Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) is up 23%.


Financial News
--------------


The Philadelphia Fed's gauge on March manufacturing trounced expectations. Analysts expected a reading of 5.5 but it came in at 13.7. In February, the needle hit minus 4.1.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 221,000, a bit better than the 225,000 expected.


Leading indicators for February rose 0.2% vs. the Street's view of 0.1%. The gauge attempts to predict economic conditions six months out.

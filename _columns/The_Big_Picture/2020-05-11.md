The Nasdaq composite added some room above 9000 Monday as the composite reversed higher, but the stock market in general tailed off in the final hour to pare the day's winnings.




The composite extended its win streak to six days, the longest of the current uptrend, and the longest since December. The Nasdaq closed 0.8% higher after erasing a 0.7% early decline. The S&P 500 was barely higher but off the day's lows. The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) closed 0.5% lower.


Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain below trend lines traced from the March lows, but the Nasdaq is close to regaining its line.


Other market data indicated the Nasdaq's win was selective in scope. Declining stocks led advancers by nearly 9 to 5 on the NYSE and by around 6 to 5 on the Nasdaq. The Russell 2000 fell 0.6%. Volume edged up on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


In a sense, Monday was a microcosm of this spring's stock market uptrend. The Nasdaq led, the S&P 500 came in second and the Dow third. Small caps lagged. Indeed, while the major indexes have made a remarkable rebound, the recovery has been uneven. Growth is beating value stocks, and technology is far ahead of cyclicals.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP051120-261x300.jpg)These are consequences of the coronavirus economy, where quarantines hurt factories, travel, hospitality and other businesses the most. Meanwhile, work-at-home gave many technology companies an advantage, and the fight against Covid-19 boosted much of the health care sector. This rift is evident in first-quarter earnings.


"Q1 earnings season has confirmed the bifurcation of stocks, with wide disparity in performance and fundamentals between clear 'haves' and 'have nots' in the current environment," Larry Adam, chief investment officer of Raymond James Private Client Group, wrote in a report. Tech-oriented and noncyclical sectors are set to grow earnings by 3.2% on average in Q1, he noted. By contrast, cyclical companies are set to suffer an earnings contraction of 34.7% in Q1 and a staggering 81.6% decline in Q2.


Stock Market Sector Performance Varies
--------------------------------------


Sector performance reflects this trend, as do the major indexes. Eventually, it filters down to stock picking.


The S&P technology sector is now up more than 4% for the year, and health care is nearly back to breakeven. But the S&P transportation sector is down about 25%, the industrial index is off more than 20%, and financials and energy are down 29% and 36.5%. Rarely do you find such drastic performance gaps.


Analyzing the sector performance helps explain why the Nasdaq is doing so much better. The composite — which is nearly half technology and 10.6% health care — is not even 6% from a new high.


The Nasdaq's titan companies have spearheaded the index. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are 39% to 55% off their March lows. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is following through on its late-April [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), also up for a sixth straight day Monday. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is pausing but trading near highs.


Those five stocks alone account for more than one-third of the Nasdaq composite and can take much of the credit for the index's gains. With favorable trends at its back, the Nasdaq is 6% away from erasing its coronavirus losses, while the S&P is 13%. The Russell 2000 is still more than 20% away from prior highs.



Taking it a step further, growth (and its quarantine angles) has been the stock pickers' sweet spot.


**Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) (online textbooks), **Bandwidth** ([BAND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAND)) ([internet calling](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/bandwidth-stock-gains-as-internet-calls-surge-amid-work-from-home-shift/)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) (online retail), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) ([cybersecurity for telecommuting](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/fortinet-stock-hits-all-time-high-work-from-home-economy/)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) (cashless payments) are among the most successful breakouts of this spring.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), a growth index that includes some of those winners, rose nearly 2% Monday. One stock alone, **Quidel** ([QDEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QDEL)), was a big factor. It soared more than 30% after the [FDA approved a 15-minute Covid-19 test](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-test-faster-cheaper-simpler-quidel-stock-flies/) that looks for antigens.

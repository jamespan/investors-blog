Stocks Fall For Third Straight Week, But There Are A Few Reasons For Optimism
==============================================================================

Indexes fell for the third straight week, as the stock market finds itself in the weakest shape since the coronavirus bear market.




The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 lost 1.1% after an afternoon rebound reduced the day's losses. Both indexes undercut the prior week's lows, extending a downtrend unfolding since the start of the month. It's the longest weekly losing streak since the market bottomed in March.


Friday's quarterly expiration of options and futures contracts, known as quadruple witching, caused volume to swell. The increase in volume meant the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The S&P 500 now has seven distribution days, reflecting the market's woes.


While the S&P 500 nearly matches its 8% decline in mid-June, the Nasdaq's nearly 12% drop is far worse than earlier drops since May.


Stock Market Big Guns Face Difficulties

The market's keystone stocks face bigger difficulties than they have since the bear market, too. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) — which combine for roughly one-third of the Nasdaq — are all below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


In most cases, their shares are further below the 50-day line than at any time since May. Apple today is 23% off its prior high, far worse than its 11% dip in late July. Other major stocks also are going through their largest declines in months.


Now more than 10% from prior highs, the Nasdaq could be termed to be in a correction. IBD's market outlook is not quite so bearish, noting a market uptrend under pressure. Is that being too optimistic? Well, there are still signs the stock market can pull through this sell-off.


The Nasdaq closed in the upper 60% of Friday's intraday price range, which is an indication of support. Index declines have moderated since the Sept. 3-4 plunge. The market's retreat was almost necessary after months of superb gains.


IBD 50 Keeps Up With Stock Market
---------------------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed in the upper 40% of the day's range Friday. The IBD 50 is performing comparably to the Nasdaq this month, both down about 8%.


The growth index (down 1% Friday) includes a number of stocks that are holding up and may become the leaders of the next market upturn.


**Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)), an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock, **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **PennyMac Financial Services** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)) made new closing highs.


To be sure, the stock market faces risks today that require investors to take better care. Many leaders that seemed to be rising from support at the 10-week moving average are failing. **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are a few examples.


Be sure to [cut losses short](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), no more than 7% or 8% below your purchase price. Taking some profits is important. Buying more stocks is risky, as failed breakouts for **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) and **Nasdaq** ([NDAQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NDAQ)) show.

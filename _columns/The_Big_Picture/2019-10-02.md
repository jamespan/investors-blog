title: Stock Market Sell-Off Breaks Support Levels Amid Recession Fears; Apple, Boot Barn In Focus

The stock market sold off sharply Wednesday on mounting recession fears. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined nearly 2.1% at its session lows, as it approaches a key long-term support level. The Dow Jones industrials plunged through its 50-day moving average, a prior support level.




The Dow Jones industrials closed with a loss of 1.9%, or 494 points; the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.6%. The S&P 500 ended the day with a 1.8% decline. Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a 0.9% loss. Volume rose across both main exchanges, adding another distribution day to both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


The recent news-driven volatility is typical of a difficult environment. On Tuesday, [weak ISM manufacturing data](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-stock-market-rally-apple-microsoft-schwab-commissions/) triggered a sharp decline in the major stock indexes. Early Wednesday, ADP payrolls for September slowed to a gain of 135,000 jobs, down from 157,000 in August. It could be a sign of a weak September jobs report, due out Friday morning.

Stock Market Remains Under Pressure
-----------------------------------


On Sept. 5, the [market uptrend resumed](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/trade-war-news-lifts-stock-market/) on upbeat China trade news. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.75% to regain its key 50-day level. Less than three weeks later — on Sept. 24 — the uptrend faltered, shifting IBD's stock market into an "uptrend under pressure." Now, the major indexes are once again dropping to near their key 200-day support levels. A breach of those levels would worsen an already difficult condition for the market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP100219-237x300.jpg)Amid a two-day sell-off, the Nasdaq composite is once again nearing its long-term 200-day moving average line. The index has been able to maintain this key level since early June. The S&P 500 index fell further below its 50-day line Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke down through its own 50-day line.


On a positive note, the stock market may be getting oversold and could be due for a bounce. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) reached as high as 1.37 Wednesday, reflecting a high number of bearish bets on stocks, before ending the day at 1.24. Historically, such spikes in investor fear often coincide with market lows. But remember, investors shouldn't be trying to time or buy the lows. Meanwhile, "hoping" the stock market comes back is always a dangerous gamble.


With a stock market clearly under distribution (the S&P 500 now has seven distribution days), investors should have a defensive mindset. It is evident the stock market environment is not conducive to substantial gains. Breakout attempts from tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) have both faded. Investors should be locking in some profits and cutting losses much quicker than usual.



The stock price action of former [Leaderboard stock idea](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) is indicative of a troublesome stock market. On Sept. 9, the stock reached a new 52-week high with a 5% advance. The following trading session, shares topped a 34.33 buy point in a cup base. A strong relative strength line signified notable stock market outperformance. But that strength faded along with the general market. Shares broke down below their 50-day line Wednesday in heavy volume, triggering the [key loss-cutting sell rule.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/)


IBD 50 Nears Recent Lows
------------------------


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stumbled 1.6% to its lowest level since early September, amid pervasive weakness throughout the index of top growth stocks. Only a handful of stocks ended the trading session in positive territory, while 15 stocks declined more than 2%.


On the downside, Brazilian stocks **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) and **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) fell about 5.5% apiece. Both payment processors are now below their 50-day lines.



On the upside, **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) and **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) were two of the top-performing growth stocks. Kirkland Lake gained more than 3%, as it tries to take back its 50-day line.


Boot Barn — [Monday's pick](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-boot-barn-stock/) for [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) — reversed from early losses to gain more than 1% and found support at its 50-day line. The top retail stock is tracing a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 37.72 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Boot Barn [has a 96](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-boot-barn-holdings-inc-boot.aspx) out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) helps investors easily measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


Top Stocks To Watch: Apple, Boot Barn, Burlington
-------------------------------------------------



Despite a weakening environment, it's important to never tune out, particularly during a news-driven market. Keep a close eye on stocks that are holding up best during a volatile market; they will have [strong RS lines.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) For example, iPhone maker Apple's RS line reached a new high Tuesday.


[Dow Jones stock](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) Apple is trading just below a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) 221.47 entry after Wednesday's 2.5% fall.


[IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) seems to be tracing a [bullish base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/burlington-stores-stock-bullish-base-pattern/) with a 209.46 buy point. A flat base is looking to form by the end of the week. The stock's RS line is nearing new highs. Shares fell 1.8%.

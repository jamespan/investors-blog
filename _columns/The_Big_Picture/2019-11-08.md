Stock Market Rally Hovers At Record Highs Amid Trump's China Trade Comments
============================================================================

The major stock indexes hovered near record highs Friday, ending the week with positive action amid President Donald Trump's comments on U.S.-China trade talks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite easily outperformed the other major stock indexes with a solid advance.




The Nasdaq ended the session with a 0.5% gain. The S&P 500 rallied 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 6 points. The three indexes rallied in the final 90 minutes. Weakness in **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) — down 2% and 1.8%, respectively — weighed on the Dow.


Initial strength in **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) — sparked by [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-earnings-slated-q4-2019-disney-stock/) — faded throughout the day. [Disney stock](https://www.investors.com/research/disney-stock-buy-now/) jumped as much as 5.5% to a high of 140.25, as it tried to break out past a 140.18 buy point in a shallow [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Shares closed at 137.96, up 3.8%. Keep in mind the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) is weak.


Volume was sharply lower on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. Thursday's trading.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP110819-239x300.jpg)](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 0.4%, outpacing the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials. The index of top growth stocks is trying to regain its 200-day moving average after spending about two months mainly below that key level.


Current Stock Market Rally
--------------------------


All three major stock indexes notched record highs the past week and extended weekly win streaks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the top-performing index, with a 1.2% advance. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq extended its weekly win streak to six weeks, and the S&P 500 made it five up weeks in a row.


Amid the recent rallies, [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) — signs of institutional selling — continue to abate. Even bearish U.S.-China trade news was not enough to hold the stock market down for long Friday. President Trump said [he has not agreed](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-mulls-china-trade-war-retreat-dow-jones/) to roll back tariffs on China, but appeared willing to do so to seal a "phase one" trade deal.

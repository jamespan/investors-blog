S&P 500 Logs New Distribution Day, But Most Leaders Healthy
============================================================

The major indexes fell again Wednesday as the S&P 500 logged its fifth loss in six sessions. Yet market conditions for growth-stock pickers remain positive.


The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% as volume on the New York Stock Exchange crept higher. Disappointing private sector jobs growth from ADP may have disappointed traders.


The Nasdaq composite eased 0.3%, less than Tuesday's 0.6% drop. Nasdaq trading cooled.


Normally, one would get a bit nervous when a key index such as the S&P 500 goes on such a pronounced losing streak.


Yet, the market deserves a close look at the day-to-day price action on a high, low and closing basis. That's the purpose of studying the charts on the "What's The Market Trend?" page on B3.


As seen on that page, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished in the upper half of the intraday range for a second straight day.


So even as the market fell, it fell grudgingly. Why? Deep-pocketed fund managers tried to arrest the slide with their own share buys. Such subtle action perhaps reflects a market that is still seeing solid demand.


Even though the S&P 500 has now marked four combined distribution days — heavy-volume sell-offs — in the past few sessions, selling intensity still seems lacking.


Of course, pullbacks are healthy and necessary to the life span of a market uptrend. Brief sell-offs keep everyone honest.


Meanwhile, the majority of leading stocks — **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), highlighted in today's [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/030415-741959-can-i-still-buy-ambarella.htm), **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and others — certainly make it easier for the individual investor to outperform the general market.


So far, though, many mutual funds are failing to do so amid a seemingly unquenchable thirst by financial advisers, financial planners and individual investors for exchange-traded funds.


As seen at the bottom of page B3, IBD's Mutual Fund Index continues to lag the major indexes. As of Wednesday's paper, the index was up 4%. That trails the Nasdaq's 5.1% advance but beats the S&P 500's 2.4% rise.


Clearly, the slamming of oil, coal and steel stocks has hurt the S&P 500, but not investors who have focused on stronger names.


The IBD 50 ended flat.


**Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) stock is looking healthier than its online ad rival **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). The former launched a "carousel" format of new ads on its Instagram. Facebook is 1% off its 82.17 high.

Tariff jitters merged with lingering disappointment from last week's economic news to start the week, though two of the major indexes managed to reverse course and squeeze out a gain while the third trimmed losses to a minimum on Monday's stock market. Three defensive plays managed to stage would-be breakouts, while **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) fell.


Up ahead, two key jobs reports headline the week along with President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" on imported goods.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a three-day losing streak as did the S&P 500. Dow stocks turned positive around noon and ended the day 1% higher. The S&P 500 also reversed higher after a steep early fall and finished 0.6% higher.


The Nasdaq also erased most of its morning losses and finished the session just 0.1% lower. With major indexes remaining below the 200-day moving average, Investor's Business Daily maintained its recommended market exposure at 0% – 20%.


These Indexes Reversed As Well
------------------------------


The day saw reversals in other indexes as well. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, recovered from an early tumble and finished unchanged. The NYSE Composite gained 0.7% and found support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). And the S&P MidCap 400 Index and S&P SmallCap 600 Index gained 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively, after a poor showing in the morning.


Also, the small cap Russell 2000 got some juice from the broader afternoon recovery, though it ended 0.5% lower on Monday. The index is testing support at the 2000 level. Growth stocks in the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF lagged 0.9%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP033125-272x300.jpg)After falling sharply in the first hour of trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose and was unchanged for the day.
Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange compared with the same time on Friday. Decliners outnumbered advancers for much of the trading day on both exchanges. But breadth improved with advancers edging past decliners on the NYSE by the close. Winners still lagged on the Nasdaq, however, by nearly 2-to-1 at the closing bell.


On The Agenda: Jobs Data, Trump's 'Liberation Day,' Tesla Deliveries
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Wednesday's ADP payroll data and Friday's jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department — both covering the month of March — are on this week's agenda. The data follows inflation data from last week that showed [prices rose more than expected](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-pce-inflation-feb-trump-tariffs-sp-500/) in February. That came even as consumer sentiment, as surveyed by the University of Michigan, weakened for March.


Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" with tariffs on imported goods is set to arrive on Wednesday. [Reports](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-couldnt-care-less-if-car-prices-go-up-b9b4a211?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D66489638613658054300386610654558475837%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1743429934&_gl=1*j1wm45*_gcl_au*ODk3ODQ4MDA2LjE3NDE3ODA5MTEuNDg5ODc3MzExLjE3NDIzOTg2NTkuMTc0MjM5ODY1OQ..*_ga*MTYxNTg2MzA4OS4xNzQxNzgwOTEy*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MzQyNjE1Ny43MS4xLjE3NDM0Mjk4NzQuNTcuMC4w) stated that tariffs are likely to be applied to all U.S. trading partners. But more selective reciprocal tariffs are also on the table. Last week, duties of 25% on automobile imports slammed the stock market.


Also, [Tesla fell with first-quarter deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-quarterly-deliveries-lowest-in-years/) due Wednesday. Analysts scaled back their estimates to 5% year-over-year growth, but deliveries could end up hitting a new low of 377,592. The electric-car maker had dropped by nearly 8% at one point, but pared that down to less than 2% by session's end as the market recovered.


Stock Market: These Three Defensive Plays Break Out
---------------------------------------------------


Monday's breakouts were telling signs that at least defensive investments continued to pay off. But several of these are rallying into resistance areas and may be turned back. Investors should tread cautiously during the current market correction.


Insurance stock **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)) broke out of what would be considered an early-stage consolidation base in normal markets. Discount retail chain stock **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) edged past what usually would be a double-bottom base's entry but faces resistance at 120.


In utilities, **New Jersey Resources** ([NJR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NJR)) also broke out from a cup with handle but risks of a rollover remain with resistance around the 55 price level.

How The Dow Did On The Stock Market
-----------------------------------


Outside those defensive stocks, Dow Jones retail leaders **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) gained along with fellow blue chips **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), biotech giant **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).


Though IBM and Apple gained, all the Dow losers came from the tech side, except for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which was the biggest loser. The blue-chip tech losers were Nvidia, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


In yet another sign of tech weakness and diminished outlook for artificial intelligence infrastructure buildouts, Nvidia-backed **CoreWeave** ([CRWV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWV)) dived on its second trading day after the company debuted with a [downsized initial public offering on Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coreweave-ipo-prices-low-nvidia-backed-startup-ai-stock-demand/).


Meanwhile, five retail industry groups were among the 10 biggest gainers among Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups.


Finally, **Mr. Cooper** ([COOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COOP)) soared on news that **Rocket Companies** ([RKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RKT)) will acquire the consumer loan services provider for $9.4 billion in stock.

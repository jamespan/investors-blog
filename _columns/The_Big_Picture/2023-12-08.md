The stock market fought its way out of negative territory Friday to end the session higher following a cautiously optimistic response to the latest jobs report. Now an upcoming decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve looms large.




The Nasdaq composite turned in a decent 0.5% gain Friday, rising 0.7% for the week. This was its sixth straight week in the black and it is holding well above its short-term moving averages. The tech-heavy index is now up nearly 39% since the start of the year.


The S&P 500 notched another new high for the year as it gained 0.4%, pulling further ahead of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) in the process. While the index turned in a modest weekly gain, it also rose for a sixth week in succession. The benchmark index is now up more than 20% for 2023.


Advancers edged out decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The number of issues at new 52-week highs is also higher than those at lows on both exchanges, markedly so for the NYSE.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average kept pace with the other major indexes on Friday thanks to a 0.4% gain. Aerospace giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and banking behemoth **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) outperformed.


Small caps shined once again, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.7%. Growth stocks also rose, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gaining 0.4%.


Fed Chair Powell Looms After Jobs Report
----------------------------------------


The stock market was initially lower as investors digested the November jobs report. Labor Department data showed employers had added a seasonally adjusted 199,000 jobs, which was above expectations.

But investors seemed to take heart from the fact that the numbers were massaged upward due to a return to work during the month by striking autoworkers. It also was below the 2023 average.


The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% after 500,000 more Americans entered the labor force. The jobless figure had risen to 3.9% in October. Average hourly earnings rose 4% year over year, a slight uptick but still well off highs for the year.


Stocks also were bolstered after a University of Michigan survey showed inflation expectations had fallen while consumer sentiment rose to its highest level since July.


Now all eyes will turn to the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the coming week. With rates expected to hold steady, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference on Wednesday will be a key moment. His comments on the future direction of interest rates will be closely watched, especially as a number of cuts are already being priced in for 2024.


Other noteworthy economic data dropping next week include the latest consumer price index figures, which come Tuesday, and U.S. retail sales numbers, which drop Thursday.


In addition, the likes of **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) release earnings reports in the coming week.

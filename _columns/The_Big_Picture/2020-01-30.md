The stock market recovered from an early sell-off Thursday, as fears over the coronavirus hit the market initially. But indexes fought back impressively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 245 points before closing with a 124-point gain.




The Nasdaq composite closed with a 0.3% gain after falling as much as 0.9% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also ended with a 0.3% increase, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%.


The IBD 50 — a computerized list of leading growth stocks — rallied 0.6%. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

Stock Market Rally Avoids More Distribution
-------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 both looked like they would add [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) early Thursday amid a sharp sell-off, but they recovered all their losses in a dramatic turnaround. Still, given the potential coronavirus headwind, it makes sense for investors to play a bit more defense than usual.


The Centers for Disease Control confirmed the first human-to-human coronavirus infection in the U.S. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization declared the virus a global health emergency. But WHO stopped short of recommending a travel ban for China.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP013020-212x300.jpg)The stock market's best stocks were sharply mixed Thursday. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged as much as 12% to 650.88 after the company's [blowout earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-surges-record-high-earnings-report/). On the downside, social media giant **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) tumbled as much as 8.3% to 204.75 after its [Q4 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-drops-as-fourth-quarter-earnings-outlook-raise-concerns/), but the stock did stem its slide near its 50-day moving average line, closing above the support level.


There are three key ways to determine the overall strength of the stock market: The distribution-day count of the major indexes, the action of the leading stocks and your portfolio's performance. If your portfolio is seeing downside pressure, then it makes more sense to adjust into a more defensive mindset by reducing exposure. Remember, you don't have to wait until a 7%-8% loss on a stock before cutting losses. You can always buy the stock back later.


If your stock selection has been on point and is — so far — shrugging off the coronavirus-driven market weakness, then you have the option to remain aggressive and push for more profits. However, you have to remain flexible. Downswings can happen quickly, and you have to be prepared to shift gears.


Top Stocks Reporting Earnings: Amazon, Vertex, Visa
---------------------------------------------------



**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) [crushed Q4 earnings and sales targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-revenue-crush-estimates-as-stock-jumps/) late Thursday. Amazon stock surged about 11% to 2,090 in the after-hours session. If the stock's price action holds to Friday, it would stage a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) above a [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/)'s 1,917.92 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares found support around their long-term 200-day line this week.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup,](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) Amazon stock [has a measly 64](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). But that will surely improve in the wake of the company's strong earnings results. Headed for a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, Amazon's rally would benefit the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


**Vertex** **Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) [beat the Street's Q4 earnings and sales estimates](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/vrtx-stock-vertex-pharmaceuticals-earnings-q4-2019/), sparking a 4% gain to about 240 after the close Thursday. The top biotech stock hit the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from its 195.91 buy point in recent weeks. Investors could have taken at least some profits at that time, especially heading into a potentially volatile earnings release.


Dow Jones payment giant **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) dropped about 2% to 204 in the after-hours session after the [company's earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/mastercard-earnings-q4-2019-visa-earnings-q1-2020/). Shares ended the session up 1.6% to 208.21 — about 14% above a 182.50 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).

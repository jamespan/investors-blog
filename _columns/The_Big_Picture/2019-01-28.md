The stock market had a flashback to December, as indexes sold off, oil prices slid and technology stocks declined broadly Monday.




The Nasdaq composite stumbled 1.1%, although it pared a loss that reached as much as 1.8% early on. Semiconductor, biotech, internet and other tech shares suffered heavy selling.


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.8%. Both also trimmed losses, and all three main indexes held above their 50-day moving averages. Indexes also remained within a weeklong trading range, so no major break was evident. Instead, a pause seems to be taking shape.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MP_2x1_022819-252x300.jpg)The Nasdaq and S&P 500 final price bars Monday were positive. Why? Both closed near session highs, excluding a price gap at the open of trading.


Those four factors ameliorated Monday's losses, plus the fact that institutional investors weren't selling so heavily. Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Leading stocks were in line with the general market: The IBD 50 fell 0.9%. Small caps saw a slightly milder decline. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both eased 0.6%.


To some readers, Monday's trading may have echoed the difficult days of December, when indexes saw many days of sharp losses and a bear market in crude oil deepened. But there's a key difference. Back then, IBD's current outlook remained at "market in correction" for weeks. Today, it's a confirmed uptrend.


Stocks have rebounded sharply since the lows around Christmas; the Nasdaq is up 14.5% from its low. That's quite a distance to travel in just over a month, and the market could use a moment to cool itself off. Days like Monday appear to serve that purpose.


Stock Market Sensitive To Headlines
-----------------------------------


The market realizes that a pause is possible, and in such times, headlines can act as a hair trigger for sellers.


Of all the headlines moving the market, two earnings reports stood out Monday. In both cases, companies saw weakness in China, an important market struggling with the trade war. The indications are that slowing economic activity is spilling over to more U.S. companies.



Industrial giant **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) reported [slowing sales in the Asia-Pacific region](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-caterpillar-sales-growth-global-economy-cools/), where construction-related sales were particularly hard hit, apparently because of higher U.S. tariffs.


Also, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) [warned of a sales shortfall](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-fourth-quarter-guidance/) in the quarter ending this month. The company cited weakness in gaming and data center systems. Gaming chip sales were soft due to "deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China," Nvidia said. Customers in the data center market have become more cautious and are delaying hardware purchases.


This week's list of earnings announcements is long and heavy with megacap companies, each acting as a bellwether for specific sectors or the broad economy.


Apple, Amazon.com Earnings Due
------------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), whose stock is still depressed, reports Tuesday after the close. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) announce on Wednesday.


**Amazon.com**'s ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) turn is Thursday. Analysts expect a profit of $5.67 a share, up 164%. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity expect a noticeable deceleration in sales, but they see temporary factors to blame rather than structural factors.


On Facebook, "User transition to Story-like sharing and early Story monetization initiatives on the core Facebook platform will likely be one of the key points of discussion during the ... earnings call," Canaccord noted.


Chips spearheaded the tech sector's woes. The Philadelphia semiconductor index tumbled 2.1%. IBD's chip designers group, where Nvidia is housed, dropped 2.8%.


U.S. crude oil prices fell on worries that weakening sales at multinationals is a sign of a slumping global economy. Oil rebounded in afternoon trading — after the U.S. imposed [sanctions on Venezuela's oil company](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/28/treasury-set-to-sanction-venezuela-state-owned-oil-firm-sen-rubio.html) — yet was quoted at $52.09, down nearly 3%. Crude had been rebounding but it is now testing resistance around the $54 level.

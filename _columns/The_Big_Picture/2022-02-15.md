Stock Market Rallies In Relief From Putin Gesture; Why Inflation Matters As Much As Russia For Stocks Today
============================================================================================================

The U.S. stock market exhaled in relief Tuesday after a ray of sunshine emerged from the Ukraine-Russia border. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he withdrew a sliver of his country's 130,000-strong army and kept the door of diplomacy with the West ajar.




Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden later told the press that American officials had not yet verified Putin's claim. But Biden vowed to keep working the negotiation channels to avoid military conflict.


However, with a modicum of outstanding breakouts, few stocks reaching new highs, and many past stock market leaders still locked in repair-and-rebuild mode, the strong rebound on Wall Street does not justify changing the outlook for stocks. Just on Friday, a harsh sell-off signaled skittishness among large fund managers and spurred a change in IBD's market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" for the fourth time since Nov. 30.


(Please see [Friday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-tank-broadly-how-far-could-indexes-fall-in-an-attack-on-ukraine/) for details on all the shifts in the stock market outlook over the past three months.)


On Tuesday, small caps and the Nasdaq spearheaded the advance.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP021522-187x300.jpg)The Russell 2000 jumped 2.8%, marking its second largest advance in a single session so far in 2022. That edged out a 2.5% rally by the Nasdaq composite and gains of 1.6% by the S&P 500 and 1.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.


Don't Ignore This Stock Market Leader
-------------------------------------


**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), part of the 30-stock Dow Jones, outperformed the major benchmarks with a 2.9% rise to 197.98 in average turnover. Shares in the financial services and consumer spending play remain nominally in the 5% buy zone after clearing a [long consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) with a 189.13 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Meanwhile, travel, tech and other select financial stocks led the upside. Medical testing and clinical drug trial outsourcing firms tanked.


**Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) slid 5.3% in volume that soared 151% above the stock's 50-day average. The large cap also [snipped its 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) in the heaviest turnover so far this year.



The indexes' gains feel even more remarkable when you consider that Tuesday saw another slaughter of long-dated government bonds.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, which rose 4 basis points Monday, added another 4 basis points Tuesday. At 2.04%, this bond has essentially added half a full percentage point since Jan. 1.


Meanwhile, following another monthly report of robust increases in U.S. wholesale prices, the CME futures market-measured chances of a 50-basis-point rate hike are rising. For the March 15-16 Federal Reserve meeting, odds of a half-point increase climbed to 58% vs. 42% odds of only a quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate.


Fed Tightening Vs. The Economy
------------------------------


Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at the $100 billion wealth management and asset management arm for Tulsa, Okla.-based **BOK Financial** ([BOKF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOKF)), told IBD that he's reasonably optimistic about continued growth in the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve is about to embark on its first campaign to raise the fed funds rate for the first time since December 2018 â€” when the central bank pushed the rate up a quarter point to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.


"It looks like the economy can take it," said Wyett, who began his 41-year career in the securities markets as a bond salesman in 1982. Plus, it's very important for the U.S. central bank to remove some of its recent steps to keep the cost of money cheap and support the greater economy, because central bankers "do not want to allow an environment in which long-term inflation expectations get out of control."


Wyett asks IBD readers to look at U.S. monetary policy this way: Even if the Fed raised short-term interest rates by a full percentage point and removed $1 trillion worth of government and agency-backed mortgage securities off its balance sheet, would you call this a "restrictive monetary stance?" No.


Meanwhile, please see the [Tuesday episode of IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) for a discussion on the direction of corporate high-yield bonds and how it may impact equities. David Ryan, three-time U.S. Investing Championships winner, walked the audience through an analysis of iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ([HYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HYG)) and the S&P 500, going back as far as 2015.


Outflow In This Sector?
-----------------------


Money flowed out of some defensive areas on Wall Street. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) fell 0.5% for its third decline in four sessions.


While the S&P 500 hopped back above its long-term 200-day moving average and snapped a three-day losing streak, the utility ETF slipped a little further below its 200-day line.

Meanwhile, keep in mind that the technical picture for growth stock investors still shows lots of sore spots.


Winners smashed losers in the stock market Tuesday; data from ThinkOrSwim showed 3,729 gainers on the Nasdaq vs. 1,003 losing stocks. This translates into a nearly 4-1 margin. Yet the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been mired in a steady downtrend since early November. (You can see separate A-D lines for the Nasdaq and the NYSE on the General Market Indicator Charts page via a link at the bottom of each day's Big Picture.)


The total number of new highs remains awfully low. Please go to the daily new highs vs. new lows tally at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to keep score.


Also, consider Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)). The ETF rallied 2.7%. Nice. But a daily chart reveals no change in the chart's downward-sloping moving averages, including the 200-day, the 50-day and the 21-day exponential.


A discussion of the market's trend and the relationship between the Nasdaq and its own [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) took center stage in Tuesday's IBD Live show.

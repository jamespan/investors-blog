U.S. stock indexes posted moderate gains Friday as they battled just under their 50-day moving averages.




The Nasdaq sauntered 0.6% higher, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. Both indexes closed under their 50-day lines for the second straight day. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1% but remains above its 50-day line.


Volume fell sharply on the Nasdaq, and was lower on the NYSE also.


The uptrend remains under pressure, suggesting that investors must take greater caution than usual.

Bulls accepted the moderate gains but would've preferred a bigger rebound in strong volume. Bears were once again unable to follow up on the big loss that sellers delivered Thursday.


So far this year, the Nasdaq has posted a daily loss of 1.6% or greater on four occasions, not including Thursday's sell-off.


* On March 21, the Nasdaq fell 1.8%, and then followed with six up days in the next seven sessions.
* On May 17, the Nasdaq plunged 2.6%, and then followed with seven up sessions in a row.
* On June 9, the Nasdaq lost 1.8%, and fell further in four of the next five sessions.
* On June 27, the Nasdaq dropped 1.6%, but the next two sessions were a standoff: up 1.4% and then down 1.4%.


Friday's action fit the year's pattern of never staying down for long, but it's been just one day since the sell-off.


A market like this doesn't offer a wide pattern of opportunities, but has provided strong niches.



Chinese stocks have fielded winners but not as a buy-and-hold game. Consolidations along the way have tested investors. Chinese stocks generally have been volatile. Those who know their profit-taking rules have done well.


Meanwhile, the Shanghai composite ended a seven-week win streak with a 1.6% loss for the week. **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) scored big gains Friday.


For the week, the Nasdaq lost 1.5%; the S&P 500, 1.4%; and the Dow Jones industrial average, 1.1%.


The coming week will offer a slew of financial data, including gauges on retail sales, manufacturing and housing. Wednesday will offer perhaps the most watched item: The Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its July meeting.

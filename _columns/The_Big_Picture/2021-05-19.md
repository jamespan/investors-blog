Here we go again. For the second time in two weeks, the stock market is grasping at support levels in hopes of avoiding a deeper slide.




The S&P 500 gapped down but held at its important 50-day moving average. The index fell to that same line last week and bounced off it. Now, investors hope the S&P 500 will again rebound.


The way Wednesday's session unfolded offered reason to believe that's possible. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq sold off at the open but reduced their losses for much of the day, closing in the upper part of the day's price ranges.


The Nasdaq was down as much as 1.7% and erased almost all of that; it closed less than 0.1% lower. The S&P 500 also pared losses, ending with a 0.3% loss.


Fed Minutes Hint At Taper
-------------------------


![MP051921_2-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP051921_2--218x300.jpg)It was also encouraging how indexes handled an afternoon Fed-induced hiccup. Minutes of the April Federal Reserve meeting revealed the Fed started thinking about slowing its asset purchases, one of the tools it's used to keep interest rates near the floor.


"In our view the most important takeaway from the April Minutes is that there is no longer a consensus view in the FOMC that taper is far away," UBS economist Pablo Villanueva said in a report. "In particular, 'a number' of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress towards goals, it might be appropriate to kick off the taper discussion at some point in the coming meetings. This is the clearest indication that the taper discussion is a near-term issue."


Still, Villanueva added, any desire to start the taper plan might have diminished after weak April employment and retail sales reports.


The Fed headlines interrupted the stock market's recovery, but indexes soon resumed their afternoon advances.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also held right above its 50-day line, but failed to bounce the way the Nasdaq and S&P did. The Dow, which undercut last week's low, fell 0.5%. The Nasdaq is below its converged 50- and 21-day lines, but the 13,000 level is proving to be significant. The composite found support around that level last week and in March.


Stock Market Heavy With Distribution
------------------------------------


"Sell in May and go away" has turned out to be the correct stock market refrain. The Nasdaq is down nearly 5% this month after rising for six straight months. The S&P 500 has lost 1.6% and is on pace to break a three-month win streak.


The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) has ballooned in May. The S&P 500 now has seven after it avoided one Wednesday due to lower NYSE volume. The [April 14 distribution](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-finish-mixed-bases-setting-up-where-dr-doom-thinks-interest-rates-are-going/) was deducted Wednesday due to time. Nasdaq volume rose, but the index's loss was too small to count as distribution. Declining stocks topped advancers by about 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Strength in technology stocks helped the Nasdaq slim down its decline. Semiconductors were especially helpful. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) reversed higher and ended 1.8% higher. IBD's three chip industry groups rose 1.8% to 2.4% and were among the top seven of 197 groups.


Small Caps, Energy Among Stock Market Laggards
----------------------------------------------


But small caps, energy and retail stocks lost more than most others.


The Russell 2000 fell 0.8% even after shaving losses. In retail, a 3.3% drop in auto dealers was among the heaviest. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) fell 2.4% and closed just below its 50-day line. The drop came even though **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) rose to a new high on [strong quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/target-stock-target-earnings-q1-2021/). Target shares found support at the 10-week moving average.


While the stock market sold off broadly, some traders pointed to [plummeting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-stocks-new-crackdown-hits-cryptocurrencies-coinbase-knocked-out/). That's a market separate from equities. But the sell-off appeared to reflect a flight from higher-risk assets, at least in the earlier hours of trading.


A handful of crypto-related stocks plunged, including digital currency platform provider **Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)). The new issue slid to new lows, down nearly 6%.


Natural resources stocks, which have been market leaders, also performed poorly. IBD's mining, steelmaker and several oil groups were in Wednesday's bottom 20.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) fell 2.6% after U.S. crude prices dropped more than 3% to $63.35 a barrel late Wednesday. An increase in U.S. crude inventories pressured oil.

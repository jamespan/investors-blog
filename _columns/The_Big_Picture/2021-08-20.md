What looked like a rough week for the stock market ended up being not so bad as major stock indexes scored healthy gains Friday. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) were standout performers in the Nasdaq 100.




After closing right at its 50-day moving average Thursday, the Nasdaq composite made a stand at the key support level Friday, rising 1.2%. The S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%. Small caps snapped back after several days of weakness. The Russell 2000 jumped more than 1.6%. The index reclaimed its 200-day moving average but remains on a downtrend.


For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.7% and the S&P 500 lost 0.6% after both trimmed losses. The Nasdaq had been down as much 2.7% for the week.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Thursday. Breadth was OK, with advancing stocks beating decliners on both exchanges by more than 2-to-1.


**![MP082021](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP082021-291x300.jpg)Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) outperformed in the S&P 500, up 2.7% in light volume. It showed compelling technical action with a breakout over a short [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/), but volume was light. Still, Friday's action had the look of a setup day and brings a move over its Aug. 4 high of 527.10 into play.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Growth stocks generally had another tough week, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) down 1%. But the ETF had a solid day Friday, up 1.6%


IBD 50 component Nvidia extended gains after rising 4% Thursday on strong earnings. The position was increased on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Thursday and increased again on Friday when the leading chip stock crossed a 207.43 entry.



The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) count has been getting lighter, and the S&P 500 lost another one Friday. The July 16 higher-volume decline fell off the count because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant. A low distribution-day count isn't necessarily a sign of improving market health. But limited signs of institutional selling in the indexes are always good to see in a confirmed uptrend.


Stock market bears might be worried about waning breadth on the Nasdaq, what the Fed plans, and skittish action among many leading growth stocks. But the bulls certainly have reasons to feel good about the uptrend. Bullish sentiment dropped off a cliff earlier in the week when the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers fell to 51.1% from 56.4%. It's a contrarian indicator, meaning when there aren't too many bulls around, it might actually be the time to be bullish.

Meanwhile, headed into Friday, the Nasdaq short-term overbought/oversold oscillator was near recent lows at -824, pointing toward oversold conditions. ([MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com) subscribers can access this data using the ticker NASDQ.)


It's been a challenging environment for growth stock investors lately. That can happen when institutional investors are generally staying on the sidelines during the summer doldrums. But strong gains Friday show that the stock market uptrend is still very much intact.


Buying pullbacks is probably better than buying technical breakouts at this point. In the chip sector, **Marvell Technology Group** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) is rebounding off its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close.

Blue Chips And Banks Own The Stock Market Day
==============================================

Blue chips took control of the market uptrend Friday, as two major banks surprised the Street with better than expected earnings.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1%, while the large-cap S&P 500 added 0.7%. The Nasdaq added 0.5%.


Volume in the stock market rose on the NYSE, and preliminary data showed volume fell on the Nasdaq.


Banks set the tone for the day. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) reported [earnings about 14% higher than the consensus view](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-earnings-q1-2019-wells-fargo-earnings/). The stock gapped up 4.7% and retook its 50-day moving average. Volume was 95% above average. JPMorgan gave the Dow a boost, but not as much as **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)). The stock surged 11.5% after announcing a new video streaming service.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP041219-243x300.jpg)Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) reported earnings 11% higher than expected. The stock gapped up 2% in heavy volume and then reversed to a 2.6% loss for the day.


Improved Action For Select Banks
--------------------------------


The bank sector is lowly rated, but the Street didn't seem to care much Friday.


Some of the bank stocks were showing bullish action long before Friday's earnings reports.


**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) built a cup-with-handle base over the past 28 weeks. The stock advanced 2.3% Friday, clearing a 66.93 buy point in trade 29% above average.



**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) popped 2.5% in turnover 76% above the usual pace. Goldman is about 20% below its high but has risen 37% since its late-December low.


**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) shaped a consolidation since late January. The stock gapped up 3.9% Friday in volume 68% above normal. Shares appear to have cleared resistance around 30 but watch for a test in the coming days.



All three stocks have outperformed the Nasdaq (up 20%) and the S&P 500 (up 16%) so far this year. Citigroup is up 30%; Goldman Sachs, 24%; and Bank of America, 23% year to date.


Nine Banks To Report In Coming Week
-----------------------------------


More banks will report Q1 results in the coming week. They include Citigroup and Goldman Sachs on Monday; Bank of America and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) on Tuesday; **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and **U.S. Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)) on Wednesday; and **BB&T** ([BBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBT)) and **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)) on Thursday.


By the end of the week, it should be clear whether or not banks have much to contribute to the stock uptrend.


A Good Place For Bulls To Hold
------------------------------


Leadership in the stock market is still centered on software, electronics, computer and chip sectors. They are showing no signs of weakness.


Individual investors who have built positions in the top sectors are in a good place now. Take profits at 20% to 25%. For those winners that the investor chooses to hold longer, watch for signs of weakness such as a falling relative strength line.


Be cautious and patient about opening new positions. The best leaders tend to break out earlier than others.


IBD Innovator Funds Climb
-------------------------


In a sign of strength for leading stocks, the Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) cruised 0.4% higher Friday and 1.2% for the week. Innovator Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) advanced 0.7% Friday and 1.4% for the week.

Thanks Janet.


Stocks wiped out small early-morning losses Tuesday, soon after the most powerful banker in the world reiterated a "go slow" approach toward raising short-term interest rates. The major indexes then kept rumbling higher, right into the finish. Volume jumped sharply on both main exchanges.


The gains in heavier volume reflected anxious buying (and quite likely some short covering) among the institutional money-manager crowd. And it was just what all investors going long want to see during a market uptrend that began with bottoming action in early February and was confirmed by a follow-through on Feb. 17.


The Nasdaq composite notched its biggest up-day in more than two weeks, rising 1.7%. That was nearly twice the S&P 500's 0.9% gain. The Nasdaq now sports a respectable gain of 6.8% from the Feb. 17 close at 4534.07. Yet it still lags the S&P 500 since it's benefited less from "cash into trash" buying of oil, gold, steel and other commodity stocks that began last month.


![MP032916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP032916-602x1024.jpg)The Nasdaq is still down 3.2% for the year, while the S&P 500 is now up a smidgen. The Nasdaq 100 made a solid move above the 200-day moving average, where it tested resistance. The Nasdaq is still below its 200-day line. The S&P 500 raced past this important long-term support line eight sessions ago.


Small caps really stole the show on Tuesday. Both the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 spiked 2.7% higher. The former ripped past its 200-day moving average. The gains in companies with market values mostly of $5 billion and less coincide with the expanding breadth of the rally, a positive sign. On the Nasdaq, winners edged losers by nearly 5 to 2; on the NYSE, winners led by a 4-to-1 margin.


Careful IBD readers may notice that most of the names in the "Leaders up in volume" section of today's Market Pulse are micro- and small-cap names. Knowing the market value and average trading volume is crucial to getting a feel for how the stock will behave, especially after it breaks out. **Francesca’s Holdings** ([FRAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRAN)) ($782 million market cap, average volume of 814,000 shares) shows the kind of wild bobbing and weaving that can happen when a highly rated name attempts to clear a proper entry point and muscle into new high ground.


A solid March reading on consumer confidence (96.2, above Econoday's 94 consensus forecast) and solid growth in January year-over-year home prices, across 20 key cities as tracked by the Case-Shiller survey, gave a pleasant backdrop for equities. But it was Janet Yellen's comments during a speech at the Economic Club in New York that inspired strong buying. Share prices spiked at 12:20 p.m. ET, in line with news wires reporting that the Federal Reserve chief seeks to "proceed cautiously in adjusting policy" due to nagging risks of a global economic slowdown and volatile energy prices.


Yellen's comments reaffirmed the market's judgment after a March 16 Fed meeting that the central bank is aiming to raise the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans by 50 basis points rather than a full percentage point. The dovish comments naturally sparked a rally in U.S. government bonds; the 10-year Treasury yield sank sharply, indicating a bid up in prices.


Practically speaking, equities get a boost when bond yields fall, for it forces investors to accept more risk to get a higher return.


Considering that volume on both the Nasdaq and NYSE was extremely light on Monday following the three-day Easter holiday weekend, it may not have surprised some seasoned IBD readers that volume was going to pick up so sharply on Tuesday. Yet remember, it's not the absolute total of turnover that matters, but the relative change. Thus, Tuesday's action served as a genuine day of institutional accumulation.


Expect volume to pick up further. Wednesday provides a peek by ADP at job growth in the private sector, followed by the March payrolls report Friday before the open. **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), one of the most exciting new companies to emerge since the market's 2009 bottom, will unveil its mass-market Model 3 sedan on Thursday. Tesla closed above its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-100-stumbles-at-200-day-moving-average-but-tesla-hurdles-over-it/) for a second straight session. It sports an average daily dollar volume of $1.23 billion.

title: Stock Market Climbs But What Can Snap It Out Of Its Dull Trend?

The stock market climbed Monday but its movements during the session showed investors are unsure about the market's direction.




The Dow Jones industrial average added 1.2%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite 0.5%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. Advancers led decliners by a 12-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq.


While the gains were quite respectable, indexes shifted direction a few times. If the market seemed uncertain about its steps, it was merely a reflection of the past week or so. Aside from the gap down on May 15, indexes have basically gone nowhere.


That's not necessarily a bad omen. After making strides from the May 3 lows, indexes deserved a break. It's unclear when the next impetus may come. Trade talks with China were one factor Monday. Earnings season is winding down, and there won't be another Fed meeting until mid-June. Minutes of the early-May Fed meeting are released Wednesday afternoon, though.

On Monday, stocks opened sharply higher after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. and China "are putting the trade war on hold." The Nasdaq climbed more than 1% early on the news.


But about 90 minutes later, indexes began to give back gains. Top presidential economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the [U.S. is not ruling out tariffs on China](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/trump-advisor-larry-kudlow-china-tariffs-are-not-over.html). The Nasdaq's gain was reduced to 0.2% before the composite bounced some.


It was a symptom of the market's current propensity to react (or overreact) to news. Trading returned to some normalcy, as the S&P 500 and Dow recovered most of their morning pullbacks. Both closed in the upper half of Monday's price range.


However, the Nasdaq lagged. It closed in the lower half of the range and with a smaller increase. Weakness in biotechs, enterprise software and other software stocks hampered the composite. Generic drugs were another weak group that has a big portion of Nasdaq-listed stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose more than 1% but it wasn't enough to carry the Nasdaq higher.


Results looked better on the Dow. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)), two companies in the aerospace and defense fields, rose the most on the Dow. Boeing climbed 3.6% and neared a new high. United Technologies added 2.3%.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) rose 2.1%. The maker of heavy machinery has a significant exposure in construction equipment in China and seemed to benefit from progress on trade talks.

Small caps performed in line with other indexes, as the Russell 2000 tacked on 0.7%. But the transportation sector led. Dow transports jumped 1.3% on merger news.


**General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), up nearly 2%, said it's merging its GE Transportation unit with **Wabtec** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)), the rail equipment maker. The deal is valued at more than $11 billion. Wabtec shares rose 3.5% in big volume. Trucking, logistics and air freight groups rose 1.4% or more.


Leading stocks generally lagged. The IBD 50 rose only 0.3%. **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) extended its superb advance by an additional 4%. **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) rose 4% also after the memory-chip maker [raised its earnings and revenue guidance](http://Micron Technology Increases Quarterly Guidance; Shares Jump) for the quarter ending this month.


But a handful of other stocks offset much of the gains in the IBD 50. **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) was the worst IBD 50 stock, off 5%. It's still above a 172.17 double-bottom entry. **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) and **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), two stocks that had been streaking higher, fell 4%.


Among other leading stocks, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) cleared the 33.88 buy point of a cup-with-handle base but closed below the entry. Volume was weak and the relative strength line has not made a new high. Those factors hamper the breakout attempt.


**AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) is trying to rise past the 36.85 buy point. Volume Monday was double its average. On Friday, the stock was volatile after AstraZeneca [reported earnings and a sharp drop](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/astrazeneca-first-quarter-earnings-sales/) in sales of its Crestor cholesterol drug.

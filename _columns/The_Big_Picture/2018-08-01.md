title: Apple Helps Nasdaq Outperform Key Indexes; Watch These Rising Sectors

The Nasdaq led again. Small caps bounced favorably after a morning sell-off. Gaming shares rolled snake eyes. And Apple took another step closer to the land of $1 trillion in market cap.


Who says the stock market is dull during the thick of summer?


Thanks to a booming gain by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the tech-driven Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.5%. It's off to a fine start after lagging other equity benchmarks during July's broad-based advance.


The Nasdaq 100 rallied a touch more, up 0.6%. Yet perhaps more importantly, both the broader composite index and the Nasdaq 100 continued to rebound after tickling their respective 50-day moving averages in Monday's harsh decline.

The solid rise by the Nasdaq indexes in higher volume signifies institutional accumulation. That's good for the bulls.


Yet for now, despite a relatively low distribution-day count in the key indexes, the current outlook remains at "uptrend under pressure."


The S&P 500 also got the benefit of strength in Apple, select leading tech companies, and most of the [FAANG companies](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/). Yet it also suffered from a summary decline in gaming, commodity, cyclical and select retail stocks. In fact, as many as 31 of [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) dropped 1.5% or more. It would have been hard to see that just by following the Nasdaq.


Volume fell 10% on the NYSE to 3.46 billion shares.


Lower volume on a day in which the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average, NYSE composite and Russell 2000 all fell is also a bullish sign. Why? It shows that institutions overall weren't that anxious to sell stocks.


The Hot Industry Groups
-----------------------


On the other hand, at least 22 industry groups rallied 1% or more. They included groups as diverse as telecom consumer products (again, thanks to Apple's 5.9% jump and breakout past a 194.30 entry in a new flat base), education, shoes, insurance brokers, staffing, database software, semiconductor equipment and solar.


As a result, the S&P 500 edged just 0.1% lower. The large-cap benchmark traded in a relatively narrow intraday range of 0.7% from low to high.


The mixed action on Wednesday drove home once again the point that in 2018, the stock market is surely acting in total opposite fashion from 2017.


Last year, it seemed like stocks from virtually every sector rose in lockstep. Only the oil and gas firms were down. The energy sector ranked dead last among 33 sectors tracked in IBD's stock research tables. No more.


Today, energy firms have penetrated into the top 25 groups in terms of six-month relative performance.


Another key sector to watch? The medical sector. As the economy continues to grow, consumers generally can afford to spend more on health.


Outpatient and home care, medical products, research equipment and services, medical software, biotech and medical services groups all rank within the top 25.


A More Confident Fed
--------------------


Don't forget, too, that the Federal Reserve made a decision on Wednesday afternoon that it will not change interest rates for now. But it gave a strong clue to bond investors that two more rate hikes are on the table for the rest of the year.


The U.S. central bank noted that the jobs market "has continued to strengthen" and economic activity "has been rising at a strong rate." Last week, the government made an initial estimate of 4.1% annualized growth in U.S. GDP for the second quarter.


On Wednesday before the open, the ADP private sector jobs report reaffirmed the current strength of the American economy. Jobs grew by 219,000 in July, blowing past the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 173,000. The June increase got revised upward to up 181,000.


CME Group fed funds futures currently show a 71% probability that the Fed will raise interest rates two more times by December this year.


What 3% Means
-------------


"The 10-year yield is important to watch as it continues to move around the 3% level," Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, told IBD. "It could be the canary in the coal mine to divine whether the bond market feels the trade tensions will knock the economy off course: If it drops below 2.75% it signals trouble ahead; while a rise above 3.25% would be a sign that tensions have been reduced."


The yield on the bench mark U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped back above 3% for the first time since May 3.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rallied 1.5% to 35.26 in soft turnover. On Monday, it momentarily pierced the long-term 200-day moving average for the first time.

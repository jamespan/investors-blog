  Stock Market Goes Boldly Higher, But Volume Is Down

Stock-market bears aren't known for subtlety, but that's what they had to rely on Friday. A day after the indexes posted heavy losses in rising volume, the market delivered strong gains in falling volume.




In a technical sense, Friday's low-volume gains were less than ideal, but bears don't like to reach that far for justification. Panic is what they prefer, and there was no sign of that Friday.


The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 each popped 1.1% Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7%. Blue chips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 scored new highs Friday, quickly erasing the prior day's losses. But the Dow continued to lag, closing less than 1% from new highs.

Four Words That Spoil The Mood
------------------------------


If the stock market were a wild party — and sometimes it is, though lately it seems more like a dinner party — IBD-style investors would play the spoiler role. Strong price gains prompt no cheers, just a quiet question: What was volume like?


Those four words can wreck a mood. Bulls just want to have fun, and low volume is just too normal. Yet, there has been some boisterous partying among top stocks.


Only The Strong
---------------


Q2 earnings growth has been surprisingly strong in general. Forget the chatter two weeks ago that earnings season was not going to be pretty.


Action among top-rated stocks has been very good. Consider these stocks, each of which showed strong weekly price gains in rising weekly volume:


**Discover Financial Services** ([DFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFS)), up 13.6% for the week.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), up 10%.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), up 9.7%.


**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), up 9.5%.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), up 4.5%.


As long as the bulls are seeing breakouts or new highs or strong gains for select stocks, it's hard to complain.


What's Ahead And Behind For The Stock Market
--------------------------------------------


The first take on Q2 GDP came in stronger than estimates — 2.1% vs. views for 1.9%. That was good enough to ease worries but bad enough to favor rate cuts.


On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet. The Street expects the Fed to cut interest rates a quarter-point. The minority view is for a half-point cut.


In the meantime, a U.S. delegation is expected to restart trade talks with China on Tuesday.


Earnings season will continue with **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) reporting before the open Tuesday. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) will report after Tuesday's close. IPO **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) reports Thursday before the open.

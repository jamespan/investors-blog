title: Stock Market Rally Fades In Final Hour, But Bullish Stock Charts Abound

Another day of outperformance for the Nasdaq composite Wednesday ran into a brick wall as sellers came into the stock market during the final hour of trading. The Nasdaq came to within 9 points of the 10,000 level, led by strong showings from internet retailers, select software and semiconductor stocks. But a 1% gain faded to less than 0.2% by the close.




The Nasdaq topped 10,000 last week before Thursday's massacre. The sell-off amounted to a key test of the 21-day moving average, where the Nasdaq ultimately found support. The stock market fired a warning shot that day, and there could be more in coming days and weeks. But until meaningful selling starts to hit the charts of leading growth stocks, there's no reason to adopt an overly bearish stance.


Selling was more intense in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, but lower volume tempered the declines. The Dow Jones industrials gave back 0.6% and the S&P 500 fell nearly 0.4%. Small caps lagged badly, with the Russell 2000 down 1.8%. Growth stocks outperformed again, with Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) up 0.8%.


The S&P 500's June 11 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) fell off the count Tuesday because the index rallied 5% from that session's close. The Nasdaq's June 11 distribution day fell off the count Wednesday for the same reason. Wednesday had the look of [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) on the Nasdaq, but volume came in lower than Tuesday so it didn't qualify as distribution. That leaves a very light distribution-day count, with one on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500.


The Fed
-------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP061719-261x300.jpg)Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wrapped up two days of testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday. His tone remained dovish in front of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. A big reason why stocks have rallied so powerfully is because of fiscal and monetary stimulus introduced to fight the coronavirus crisis. And more could be on the way as Powell continues to talk about an uncertain, choppy and prolonged recovery for the U.S. economy.


It's been a torrid run for the stock market since the Nasdaq made a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) on April 6, a few days after the S&P 500 had a follow-through. Since that time, the worst losing streak for the Nasdaq is two sessions. Because the stock market has run up so much, base breakouts are getting harder to find.


But Wednesday's session served up some breakouts. **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) soared out of a base with a 19.05 entry. It's near the top of the 5% buy zone.


In the database software group, **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 151.60 buy point but backed off highs. The leader in the group at this point is **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)), which has held gains nicely after a bullish move on May 22.


**Activison Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) cleared a flat base with a 76.07 entry, but it also backed off highs by the close.

Since base breakouts are in shorter supply at this point, it also makes sense targeting industry group leaders that have already broken out but are presenting alternate entries. Several [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks are finding support at or near their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) for the first time after breakouts. They include **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)).


Stock Market Sentiment
----------------------


In other stock market data, the latest weekly Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed a drop in bullish sentiment to 54.9% from 56.9%. The drop is good news for stock market bulls because high levels of bullish sentiment have come near market tops in the past. Conversely, excessive bearish sentiment has been seen near bottoms.


Earlier this year, bullish sentiment hit 59.4% in the second half of January, and the stock market went into the coronavirus bear market about a month later. And bullish sentiment hit 61.8% in September 2018 just ahead of a sharp decline for the stock market.


In economic news, May housing starts came in weaker than expected, but it didn't have much impact on IBD's homebuilding group, which outperformed with a 0.5% gain.


Nine stocks in the group have [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95 or higher, and the group ranks in the top quartile of IBD's 197 Industry Group Rankings. Leading stocks in the group are near buy points, like **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), but both bases had deep declines of more than 50%.

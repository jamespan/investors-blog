Stocks Rally As Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady
================================================

The Federal Reserve decided to stand pat, and market bulls showed quiet appreciation. The stock market rallied broadly Wednesday, taking back more of the steep losses that it suffered from a five-day sell-off that began July 21.



Meanwhile, the medical sector remained a linchpin in the general uptrend. As today's Market Pulse shows, **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) and **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) all rose in heavy volume. Their average Q2 EPS increase was 35%.


Allergan, Icon and numerous other medical names inhabit the IBD 50, which was up 0.8%.


The Nasdaq lagged the market with a 0.4% gain on top of Tuesday's 1% rebound. Chip and software firms struggled.


The S&P 500 jumped 0.7%, hopping back above its key 50-day moving average. Ship, trucking and railroad stocks helped the broad index's cause.


The Dow transports, a lagging index in 2015, surged 1.7%.


Volume cooled on both exchanges. It's rare to see volume fall off on a day in which the Fed wraps up its regular meeting on interest rates. Yet trading desks largely expected no action by the central U.S. bank.


That said, with just three more Federal Open Market Committee meetings left in 2015 (Sept. 16, Oct. 28 and Dec. 16), the language in Wednesday's statement appeared to reflect the Fed's growing confidence in the U.S. economy. The Fed noted that "the labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment." This suggests that a shift toward raising the cost of money would not disrupt the world's No. 1 economy going forward.


London-based Edison Investment Research's chief strategist Alastair George sees the statement as a "a clear nod to September" for the first hike in the fed funds interest rate since it was last increased in June 2006.


In terms of market technicals, Wednesday was a bit more pleasing. Winners beat losers by nearly 3 to 1 on the NYSE and 5 to 4 on the Nasdaq.


As noted in the June 23 [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/072215-762918-indexes-snag-distribution-again-but-small-caps-up.htm), deteriorating breadth is a significant concern. If fewer stocks continue to rally, the burden on a smaller set of stocks to carry the market higher only grows heavier.


Time and very strong gains certainly make that challenging. At 2108, the S&P 500 has climbed 217% from its March 2009 low of 666. That's roughly equivalent to a compounded annual average return of 20% â€” well above the long-term norm for common equities.


The Nasdaq has rallied from 1265 to 5111 over the same period, good for a 25% rate.

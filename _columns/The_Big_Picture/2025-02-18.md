The stock market returned after a three-day respite to finish with minor gains, helped by a buying surge in the final half hour of the session. Under the surface, however, the movement was clearly mixed.


A dour [U.S. retail sales report on Friday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar) ahead of the Presidents Day holiday did no favors for the retail and consumer sectors. In particular, discount chain and supermarket stocks fell sharply, as did automakers, auto parts chains, airlines and nonalcoholic beverage firms.


Yet for as many industry groups that slumped, a greater number of industries rallied significantly as well. They included steel alloys, air conditioning and heating, farm equipment, plastics, data storage, chipmaking and discount and variety retail, all of which raced 2% or higher.




Is the stock market trying to tell investors that 2025 is going to be a real stock-picking year?


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund succumbed to short-term profit-taking. After rising for three straight sessions, the tracker of top-rated growth stocks eased 0.4% to 33.60. Still, its 17.5% gain since Jan. 1 is certainly one of the fund's best starts to a calendar year in decades.


A big reason why FFTY fell had to do with a wild reversal by **Grail** ([GRAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRAL)). The genomics-based disease diagnostics firm ranked No. 1 within the IBD 50 headed into Tuesday's session. The stock roared as much as 16% intraday to a new high of 63.99 before plunging 14% to 47.13 by day's end. Volume more than quadrupled the stock's 50-day average.


Stock Market Today
------------------



Grail, a June 2024 spin-off of genetic data analysis equipment innovator **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), reports quarterly results on Thursday. Grail is a highly volatile stock and its high ranking within the IBD 50 made a disproportionately large impact on the Innovator IBD 50's performance, as the ETF carries a higher weighting in the top names in the list.


Going back to the general stock market, if you've invested in the popular indexes, then Tuesday turned out all right.


The S&P 500 ultimately staged a bullish session. Down 0.2% for much of Tuesday, it enjoyed a burst of buying in the final 30 minutes to end the day up 0.2%. That action marked a narrow intraday range, no doubt. But for a stock market that has encouraged Investor's Business Daily to place the recommended investment exposure level at 80%-100% since Thursday, the positive reversal was pleasant to witness.


An All-Time Closing High For Large Caps
---------------------------------------


At 6,129, the 500 also inched to an all-time closing high.


The Nasdaq composite only advanced 14 points, or less than 0.1%. But it finished at 20,041, closing above the 20,000 level. The index achieved this despite seeing five of the [Magnificent Seven companies](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/?_gl=1*m4fiu2*_gcl_au*ODc1NjA1ODM3LjE3MzgwNzI5NjcuMTk5NTM5MDkxNC4xNzM5NDY2MDk2LjE3Mzk0NjYwOTY.*_ga*MTE2NDI0NTk5LjE3MzUwMDgyODA.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczOTkxNjQyNS44NS4xLjE3Mzk5MTg0NzIuNjAuMC4w) fall on Tuesday.


The Nasdaq 100 scraped together a 0.2% rise, even though breadth in the stock market turned out just mildly positive.


On the Nasdaq exchange, winning stocks edged losing ones by a margin of just 232 companies, early data showed. At the New York Stock Exchange, advancers outmatched decliners by a more bullish ratio of 3-to-2.


That said, check out the [homepage at MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*16iq5tu*_gcl_au*ODc1NjA1ODM3LjE3MzgwNzI5Njc.*_ga*MTE2NDI0NTk5LjE3MzUwMDgyODA.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczODI0NjI0Ny41NS4xLjE3MzgyNDcyNDYuNTIuMC4w).


Some simple statistics on the stock market highlighted continued enthusiasm for stocks, with 454 rising in above-average volume vs. 243 down in heavy trading. In addition, three stocks made the breakout screen while 13 traded near a pivot point.

Dow Reverses Nicely Off Its Lows
--------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10 points higher, or less than 0.1%. Small caps did better, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 0.6%. Banking stocks helped the cause.


Volume on the NYSE grew nearly 8% to 4.68 billion shares. On the Nasdaq, turnover rose almost 9% to 8.68 billion.


Inside The Nasdaq 100 And S&P 500
---------------------------------


Interestingly, equal-weighted versions of the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 fared better.


As discussed on Tuesday's ["IBD Live" episode](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) looked stronger on Monday. It rose 0.8% to 182.47. A daily chart highlights a cup with handle, one of the most common chart patterns etched by great stock market winners studied by IBD. A move past 183.23 would mark a bullish breakout.


Meanwhile, the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) also sounded bullish tones on the stock market, rising 1% for its fourth straight gain. It also hit new highs. This strong gain suggested that institutional money is flowing into a broader array of stocks beyond megacap tech and large-cap firms.


However, investors need to still ponder questions on the future of inflation and the economy, and what the stock market is telling us about these key issues.


"We believe there are two implications from the increase in the size of the services economy," Kurt Spieler, chief investment officer at FNBO (First National Bank of Omaha), wrote in the bank's 2025 outlook. "First, spending on services is relatively constant as compared to the variation of goods consumption. We believe U.S. economic activity is therefore less cyclical in nature and will experience longer expansion periods."

Within the stock market's consumer spending sectors, strength in restaurant chains is still notable.


**Brinker International** ([EAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAT)) rose 5% in above-average trading and ended a nine-day losing streak. The operator of Chili's and Maggiano's restaurants across the globe also retook its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). For aggressive traders, this bounce could serve as an entry point. Keep in mind, though, that the stock has staged a magnificent run since rising out of a three-month cup with handle at 73.68 six months ago.



Watch to see if Brinker loses traction again and perhaps makes a test of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


This could in fact happen to the stock of user-generated online community platform **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)). Shares dropped nearly 5% and have fallen in five of the past six sessions. The big decline underscores the importance of not chasing a stock long after the breakout. Despite the pullback, Reddit remains 171% past a breakout from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with an entry at 69.11. The large cap busted out of that base on Oct. 4, four weeks before blasting to new highs on third-quarter earnings.


**Shift4** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) also had a good day in the regular trading session. Shares rose nearly 4% and exited the 5% buy zone after a mid-January breakout past a 116.84 buy point in a seven-week base. However, in after-hours trading, Shift4 dropped 9% on news that it's acquiring **Global Blue** ([GB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GB)), a Swiss expert in tax-free shopping technology.


Both Reddit and Shift4 are members of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Looking more broadly at the stock list, at least 17 stocks fell 1% or more on Tuesday.


Stock Market Still Sensitive To Debt Market
-------------------------------------------


Indeed, the Treasury bond yield curve continues to show a more pleasant slope for lenders, particularly on the longer end of the curve.


The two-year government bond yield finished Tuesday at 4.30%, up fractionally and below 4.54% for the benchmark 10-year bond. And the 30-year Treasury bond yield hit 4.76%.


Now, with the fed funds rate for large banks sitting in a zone of 4.25%-4.5% for months, it actually does not leave much of a profit in terms of net interest margins for lenders. Yet headed into Tuesday's stock market action, financial stocks have been ranking quite high within IBD's stock tables.


As seen in [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-14-2025/), three of the 12 top-performing sectors are Finance at No. 8, Savings & Loan institutions at No. 10, and Banks at No. 12.


The SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) rallied 0.8% to 59.05. It recently struggled to clear 60, so that price level is a resistance area to watch. That said, the fund's chart also highlights an 11-week cup with handle in the works with a [potential buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 59.97.


SPDR S&P Bank's relative strength line is not impressive, however. Watch to see if the line possibly climbs and breaks its short-term downtrend.

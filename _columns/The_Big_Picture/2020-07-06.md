Do you think that, just maybe, mainstream news outlets will now report on the stock market beginning with these words? "In the stock market, the Nasdaq rose ... while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ... "




Alas, old habits are tough to break. The original Dow has been around since May 1896 and usually gets top billing. Why part with tradition?


Meanwhile, growth stocks have acted superbly since the S&P 500 delivered a market-trend-changing [follow-through day on April 2](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/). Yet the second and third quarters of 2020 continue to be a narrative dictated by the Nasdaq. If indexes were works of nonfiction, then "The Story Of Nasdaq 2020" would likely feature chapters on the post-coronavirus economy, product innovation, strong fundamentals and [sector leadership](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jul-02-2020/).


While an early afternoon lull in the major indexes pointed to some profit-taking, buyers stepped back in during the final two hours of Monday's trading. Closing the day at 10,434, the Nasdaq composite's 2.2% advance outdistanced gains of 1.8% by the Dow industrials, 1.6% by the S&P 500 and 1% by the S&P SmallCap 600.


Nasdaq 10,000: Facing Covid-19 Bullishly
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP070620-202x300.jpg)Volume rose.


The Nasdaq wiped away its remaining [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on a significant advance from a June 19 [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/)'s close of 9946.12.


Stocks got off to a roaring start amid reports that the death rate from coronavirus showed a smaller increase over the long July Fourth weekend vs. reported new cases. No one yet knows for sure what are the long-term health effects of Covid-19 on an infected human being. But recent data continues to suggest it is causing fewer fatalities among younger generations in the U.S.


No doubt, Wall Street is also feeding off a stunning five-day rally in the Chinese stock market, energized by better-than-expected manufacturing data and — for now, at least — a dearth of bashing between U.S. and Chinese government officials on trade. Over the past five sessions, the Shanghai composite has rallied more than 12%.


Plus, strong moves from the likes of **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) seem to affirm that consumer spending is picking back up in the world's No. 2 economy.

Sure, the Dow Jones' closing price of 26,287 and its daily point gains and point losses make for good news-show theater. But as IBD has been saying for years, a price-weighted index tells you little about who is really doing the heavy lifting in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).


For instance, within the 30 stocks making up the Dow industrials, only two fit the overall profile of excellent fundamentals, technical strength, and recent [improvement in fund ownership](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-stocks-are-best-mutual-funds-buying-your-watchlist-stocks-how-to-find-out/) to [earn a spot in IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


This list of hand-selected names, garnered from a wide net of stock lists and analysis by market writers, currently holds 20 individual stocks and the double-leveraged ProShares Ultra QQQ ([QLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLD)) exchange traded fund.


In The Stock Market: 5 Charts To Watch More Closely
---------------------------------------------------



No doubt, while the Nasdaq should remain your starting point for analyzing the overall health of U.S. stocks, it's smart to pay attention to signs of a shift in buying demand toward smaller companies in terms of market cap. So far, though, both the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) (up almost 0.8% Monday) and SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) (up 1.1%) have their work cut out for them in making 2020 a positive year.


Notice how both of these ETFs are swimming under their long-term 200-day moving averages for at least three weeks in a row.


Also, the Cboe Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, actually rose nearly 0.7%. The minimal rise ended a four-session slump. The VIX, accessible via the [Psychological Market Indicators page](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), traded well below 20 for months before the market got wise about the potential harm of Covid-19. All the way back in August 2000, the VIX also hit a multiyear low of 16.53 before the market's summer rally fell flat. Then the dot-com crash really got ugly. (You can see historical charts going back decades at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).)


Finally, gold has also had a stunning year amid moves by central banks around the world to inject trillions of dollars' worth of liquidity to ensure debt markets function normally. A future big drop in SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) may indicate a few things. One, institutions aren't too worried about inflation or the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Two, more money could head back into equities.


More money surely flowed out of long-dated government bonds Monday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose 1 basis point to 0.69%.


Back in small-cap land, at least one exception stood out among the market leadership.


A New Leader Is Born
--------------------



**ACM Research** ([ACMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACMR)), highlighted in the [IBD Live show on Monday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), catapulted past a 69.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [six-week base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Shares gained nearly 23%. Volume in the semiconductor equipment play nearly tripled vs. its 50-day moving average, to nearly 1.5 million shares.


As noted on a [Leaderboard chart](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), the company shows a $1.5 billion market value, a 1.5 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/), a three-year compounded earnings growth rate of 212%, and [return of equity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-growth-stocks-earnings-2019/) of 30% last year.


On The Downside
---------------


Some institutions took the opportunity to sell into strength in the software sector. Preliminary data showed mild declines, on a price-weighted basis, for the enterprise software, database software and biotech industry groups. Go to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) to see the final daily changes for all 197 IBD industries.


RV makers **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) and **Winnebago** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) both fell sharply; the former is keeping a stronger grip on its post-breakout gains. **Nikola** ([NKLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKLA)) and **Workhorse** ([WKHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WKHS)), two new electric-vehicle firms, staged drops of 14% and 15%, respectively, in heavy volume.


The Dow Jones transports rallied 1.6%.


Not Every Stock Market Leader Is On The Nasdaq
----------------------------------------------


**Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) marked a second straight down day, but the  NYSE-listed stock found bullish support at 80. This could act as a key round number for the stock. [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) has discussed the unusual strength in the data-transmission infrastructure firm in recent weeks.

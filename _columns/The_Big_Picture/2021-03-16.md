U.S. stocks faded Tuesday, as investors braced for what could be one of the most important Fed meetings of the coronavirus pandemic.




The Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee concludes a two-day meeting Wednesday, just as the central bank grapples with a surge in government yields. At 1.62%, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is at about a one-year high after a sudden acceleration starting in late January.


Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to keep rates near zero long term, even if it means sacrificing an inflation rate above 2% for a while. But the growing threat of inflation poses an obstacle, and is a worry for investors.


For the stock market — which is moving largely in reaction to yield moves — the Fed's policy statement is crucial. Powell's comments also carry more importance than in many past meetings. The policy announcement is due at 2 p.m. ET.


![MP031621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP031621-240x300.jpg)U.S. stock indexes erased or pared gains as afternoon nervousness hit the market.


The S&P 500, which had been up 0.3%, closed less than 0.2% lower. Despite an uncertain session, the S&P 500 made a record intraday high.


Nasdaq Gain Shrinks As U.S. Stocks Fade
---------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite's 1.2% morning gain melted to 0.1%. Volume fell on the composite and was indicated higher on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq 100, a benchmark for the Nasdaq's highest valued stocks, rose 0.5%. But this index also faded and met resistance at [the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Small caps were pounded. The Russell 2000, which is more heavily weighted on cyclical and financial stocks, snapped a seven-day win streak with a 1.7% loss.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4% as it also broke a seven-day win streak. Weakness in industrial components such as **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) overshadowed bullish action in the Dow's techs. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) briefly made a 52-week high. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) rose more than 1%.


The technology sector was nearly alone among sectors rising Tuesday. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) added 0.8%. The S&P communications services sector, where internet heavyweights dominate, rose 1.1%.


Semiconductor Stocks Outperform
-------------------------------


Semiconductors shouldered much of the tech sector's — and Nasdaq's — outperformance. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 1.3%. **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) rose in heavy trading, underscoring the [industry's relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-industry-groups-beget-top-stocks/).


Some software groups performed well, too.


Retail stocks were broadly lower after February sales stumbled 3%. S&P SPDR Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) skidded 2%.


A rise in grocery and gasoline sales (probably due to higher gas prices) were about the only bright spots. "Otherwise, the numbers were not only bad but truly awful," economist Joel Naroff wrote in an analysis. "We didn't even shop online as nonstore sales plummeted over 5%." Despite the sharp drop, the level of sales was the second highest on record after the January record, Naroff added.


Other [economic indicators reflected a chill](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), literally, in the U.S. economy due to extreme cold across much of the nation in February. Industrial production and the National Association of Home Builders' Index fell.


The IBD 50 fell 0.3%. As with the rest of U.S. stocks, techs performed better.


U.S. stock indexes have a high number of distribution days. That's reason to be cautious, on top of the Fed's risk. Still, IBD's market outlook is in "confirmed uptrend," so investors should gauge their exposure. The behavior of your stocks is a good way to judge exposure. Those that make sell signals are the ones to cut loose first.


Investors also should heed the sector rotation to capture bullish shifts. Opportunities in the past few months surfaced in cyclical and value stocks.

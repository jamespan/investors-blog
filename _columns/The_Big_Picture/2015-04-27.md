The Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered another distribution day Monday, a harsh reminder that institutional selling is still a daunting issue for the market, even with major averages perched near highs.

  

An early 0.5% gain for the Nasdaq faded to a loss of 0.6% by the close. The S&P 500 erased a smaller gain and closed lower by 0.4%. Small caps took it on the chin again as the Russell 2000 slumped 1.2%. Volume rose across the board.

  

The IBD 50 fared the worst, falling 2.2%, as **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) weighed. The drugmaker cratered 22% on news that it will again have to restate its 2014 earnings.

  

On the Nasdaq, declining stocks topped advancers by more than 2 to 1. The ratio was nearly the same on the NYSE.

  

Today's Market Pulse table shows a fair number of leaders up in volume, but its high distribution-day count is reason enough for growth investors to tread cautiously. New highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq last week put the market back in a confirmed uptrend, but it's still a challenging environment.

  

The market's defensive nature was on display as June gold rallied $28.30, or 2.4%, to settle at $1,203.20 an ounce. Mining stocks were among the day's top performers.

  

Biotechs weighed down the Nasdaq . **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) crashed 8%, while **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)) all fell more than 3%.

  

The **iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF** ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) fell 4% and suffered its biggest one-day point decline since its breakout in August. That's a bearish signal. Volume was more than double its average.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) held in there pretty well, rising about 2% in fast trade. After the close, quarterly earnings and sales topped views. The company also announced an increase in its share buyback and raised the dividend. Shares rose 1% in after-hours trading.

In earnings news, **INC Research** ([INCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCR)) surged 17% after the company reported a 320% jump in quarterly profit. The firm provides clinical development services for big pharma, biotechs and medical device firms.

  

Elsewhere, **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) added 2%. It's trying to clear a flat base with a 25.42 buy point.

  

A two-day Fed meeting ends Wednesday. The policy statement is due out at 2 p.m. ET.

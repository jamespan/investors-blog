The major indexes closed well off session lows, although Monday still counted as a loss for the stock market. Small caps, however, extended their revenge rally.




After a five-week win streak, the stock market deserved a break, and it got one Monday. Selling never seemed excessive, indicating that stocks are experiencing a normal pause.


The Nasdaq composite closed 0.8% lower, but had been down as much as 1.7% early on. Advancing stocks actually edged out decliners on the composite.


For the past couple of weeks, the index's ascent has certainly slowed. The Nasdaq has now fallen five of the past seven sessions, while keeping itself above an important price level of 14,000.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq Monday, which gave the index a second [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) in the past few weeks. At more than 6 billion shares traded, volume was the highest since Sept. 15 and seventh largest all year. NYSE volume fell slightly from Friday's totals.


Stock Market Rangebound, But Not Small Caps
-------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, extending a two-week rangebound pattern just as it tests its 2023 highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed a 0.6% early loss to 0.1% at the closing bell. It closed above the 36,000 level for a second straight day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP120423_2-186x300.jpg)By far, Monday's star was the Russell 2000. The small-cap benchmark added 1%. In a broadly bullish session Friday, the index stood out with a 3% burst. That took the Russell above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), where it met noticeable resistance Nov. 15 and 29.


The Russell 2000 has lagged the major indexes this year, up 6.9% vs. 35.5% for the Nasdaq and 19% for the S&P 500. It's not even beating the Dow, which has risen 9.2% so far in 2023.


Small Caps Lead
---------------


But small caps have just had their best two-day performance since Nov. 14-15. The Russell index is up about 4% the past two sessions — way better than the Nasdaq's 0.3% decline and the S&P's nearly flat performance in the same two-day period.


Financials — more accurately regional banks — led the small-cap rally. Invesco S&P Small-Cap Financials ETF ([PSCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCF)) surged nearly 6% in the two-day period. Invesco S&P Small-Cap Consumer Discretionary ([PSCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCD)) and Invesco S&P Small-Cap Consumer Staples ([PSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCC)) are up nearly 5%.


Invesco S&P Small-Cap Industrials ([PSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCI)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on Friday and remains in [buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) from its 105.63 buy point.


Some of the most recent breakouts are in fact small caps. That includes electrical equipment provider **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)), **Paymentus Holdings** ([PAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAY)) and **Modine Manufacturing** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)).


"Friday's Russell rally, while not especially unusual, does signal the possibility of a classic 'dash for trash' rally in small caps this month," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a note to clients early Monday. "This slice of the U.S. equity market has lagged large caps in 2023, largely due to its spotty profitability and worries that high interest rates would crimp the ability of smaller companies to raise affordable incremental capital. Now that rates seem to be heading lower, it makes sense that small caps could continue to play catch up."


Seasonal Tailwinds For Stock Market
-----------------------------------


And while small caps partied, Vanguard Megacap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) fell 0.6%, locked in a two-week sideways pattern. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 6 basis points to 4.28%, which probably caused some selling in equities.


Seasonal factors favor the stock market right now.


December historically is the third-best month of the year for the three major indexes and second best for the Russell 2000, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. In pre-election years like the current one, December is the Nasdaq's best month.


Of course, December includes the [Santa Claus rally](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/stock-traders-almanac-inventor-found-lucrative-market-patterns/), which the Almanac discovered and describes as the final five days of December and first two sessions of the new year. Historically, that period has produced a 1.3% stock market gain since 1969.


In years when indexes fall during the Santa Claus rally, the market "tends to precede bear markets, or times stocks could be purchased later in the year at much lower prices," the Almanac notes.

  Sellers Torch Nasdaq On Snap Warning; Why Wednesday's Fed Minutes Matter Greatly Now

When discussing tech stocks, normally the Nasdaq composite comes up, of course. But credit Tuesday's sell-off to a social media titan that trades on the NYSE.




**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) collapsed 43% to a two-year low of 12.79 as 283 million shares exchanged hands — or one in every five shares of the company's float. The Venice, Calif., firm's management issued a [weak sales outlook for the second quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-plunges-on-revised-outlook/). And it warned of deteriorating economic conditions.


The stock had already plunged 73% from a peak of 83.34 ahead of Tuesday's walloping. And prior quarterly reports spurred at least part of that earlier decline. In Q1, the operator of the popular Snapchat app had broken a long string of profitable quarters with a net loss of 2 cents a share. Meanwhile, revenue grew 38% vs. a year earlier to $1.06 billion. By itself, that's a healthy increase. But it also marked a third quarter in a row of fast deceleration (from increases of 116%, 57% and 42%) in the prior three quarters.


Snap's lesson for investors? Fundamentals do matter. And top growth stocks can certainly fall more than 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the correction occurring in the major indexes.



While the Nasdaq composite slumped nearly 2.4% on Tuesday, it finished in the upper half of the day's range. That's cold comfort, however, considering how the tech-laden index so quickly gave back all of Monday's 1.6% rebound.


Is Nasdaq 11,000 just a matter of time? On Friday's low of 11,035, the index has fallen 32% from an all-time peak of 16,212.

The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. Buying in defensive industries — think auto parts, nonalcoholic beverages, tobacco, utilities, food, and gold and silver mining — buffered the large-cap benchmark's slide. Early data showed at least 16 of IBD's 197 industry groups, including oil drilling, consulting, integrated telecom and retail supermarkets and mini markets, gained 1% or more on Tuesday.


Beyond Nasdaq
-------------


The NYSE Composite outperformed the Nasdaq. It whittled an early 1.9% slide to a 0.3% loss. Meanwhile, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and two more members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2 points or more, enough to shove the blue chip index up almost 0.2%.


Volume climbed on both main exchanges.


As gyrations continue to shake out both individual and institutional holders, cash remains the best position during a stock market correction.


Disappointing data on the manufacturing and housing sides of the economy (detailed in [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-indexes-crush-rally-hopes-resume-sell-off-social-media-stocks-fall-on-snap-warning/)) also made their impact on stocks.


"There's lots of stagflation in the new home market," Yardeni Research wrote in a note sent to clients on Tuesday.


Housing Vs. The Economy
-----------------------


In April, new home sales in America fell 16.6% vs. revised numbers in the prior month to an annualized rate of 591,000. That fell way short of [Econoday's consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 750,000 units. Total months' supply of new homes jumped to 9.0 from 6.5 the prior month. Sales declines were especially steep in the South, Midwest and West. And yet the median price of a new home grew 19.6% year over year to a record $450,600 and up 45.35% over the past 24 months.


"Those incredible price increases are partly attributable to fewer sales of lower-priced homes," the research firm added. "The Fed has increased the federal funds rate by only 75 bps (basis points) so far this year, but a combination of soaring home prices and rapidly rising mortgage rates have slammed the affordability of buying a home."


But some observers stress the U.S. is not in as terrible economic shape as the market may have you believe.


"The economy is still pretty strong," Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at financial advisory giant Cetera, told IBD. "Jobless claims are rising but the labor market has a very strong foundation. The consumer is in great shape, and inventory rebuilding is happening. The economy will be able to handle less stimulus (from the government and Fed.)"


Goldman also notes that strong imports played a big role in the preliminary 1.4% annualized decline in U.S. first-quarter GDP.

The Bond Market
---------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wBigPic03242022-300x170.jpg)Goldman also points out how, unlike in past tough times in the market and economy, the spread between much riskier junk bonds and safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has not climbed at an alarming rate so far.


He keeps a sharp eye on the difference in yield between corporate bonds rated below investment grade and corresponding U.S. government bonds. A surge in this spread highlights the strong chances of a recession.


On Tuesday, the yield on the key 10-year Treasury fell for the fourth time in five sessions. It reached as low as 2.71%, according to Cboe data.


Reading The Minutes
-------------------


Traders on Wednesday will no doubt focus on the minutes from the Federal Reserve's May 3-4 meeting on interest rates. Back then, the U.S. central bank raised the fed funds rate by 50 basis points to a target range of 0.75%-1%. Future meetings in June and July also point to additional half-point increases in this key rate for overnight bank loans.


"The Fed will be aggressive (with raising interest rates), but not as much as the market thinks," Goldman said. But he also expects market volatility to remain high for the time being.


What the market would like to know: Is the Fed showing more or less unanimous opinion that a couple more half-point rate hikes is the right path to tamp down inflation in the near term? Loretta Mester, head of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, has publicly called for a 75-basis point hike. But St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has signaled to the media that he would be content with a 50-basis point jump, unlike his earlier calls for a bigger increase.


Look further long term, and Goldman notes that two new members of the 2022 interest rate policy committee, Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook, could be characterized as doves within the group. Why? They've cited research that raising interest rates too quickly could harm the economic potential of lower and middle-class working families.


Goldman acknowledges that the Federal Reserve shows a strongly hawkish stance after it became clear that inflation is strong. But he also argues that at some point, "the doves will come out," declaring the central bank will not have to push up the cost of money as quickly as before.


Expect the [FOMC minutes](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) to hit the wires at 2 p.m. ET.


The latest reading on first-quarter U.S. GDP arrives on Thursday.


The ThinkOrSwim platform showed falling stocks exceeded rising ones by a 5-2 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 5 to 4 on the NYSE.

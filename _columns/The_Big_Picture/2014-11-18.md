After several days of indecisive trading, the market broke out of its funk Tuesday as buyers reasserted themselves.


The S&P 500 — which had closed five straight days with nothing more than a 0.1% change in price — suddenly jumped 0.5% and closed near session highs.


The Nasdaq composite had gone 11 straight sessions with nary a move (changes of 0.4% or less, to be precise). On Tuesday, it climbed 0.7% and made its highest close since March 28, 2000.


Although the composite made a 14-year closing high, it remained in a modest uptrend and didn't show the sharp upward shift that the S&P 500 did.


It was a qualified relief to see the market come out on the upside after having flattened out.


Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq. The Stocks On The Move table wasn't exactly packed with gainers in heavy trading. Winning stocks led losers by about 3-to-2.


After catapulting from their mid-October lows, the indexes were due for some sort of moderation. But a couple of weeks of sluggish trading have been as weak as the market has gotten.


Chart watchers have to wonder if the indexes are overbought and due for a serious pullback. Some technical indicators suggest that's the case, yet the indexes made new highs.


The best indicator of a weakening market is a spate of distribution days. Few distribution days are in the market's ledger. Since the Oct. 21 follow-through, only two days of higher-volume declines have occurred, plus one stalling session.


While it is holding up well, the market certainly hasn't been as vibrant as it was in the latter half of October, and that goes for the leading stocks, too.


**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) are among a passel of top-rated stocks stalled around their buy points.


The IBD 50 also snapped out of a dull trading range. It surged 1.3% Tuesday as two of its chip stocks broke out of bases.


**Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) cleared the 90.98 buy point of a cup-without-handle base, but volume was below average. **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) broke out of a cup with handle, rising past a 46.10 buy point. Volume also was lukewarm. The handle has an upward-wedging shape, which is considered a weakness for the chart.


The new moves were the latest sign of a sharp rebound in chips. Remember when **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) warned in October that the industry was entering a correction? Its forecast still may be correct, but it showed the importance of understanding charts as much as fundamentals.


In the four weeks since the follow-through that confirmed the current uptrend, a mix of technology, finance, auto and consumer stocks have led the market.


The airlines industry group is up more than 20% and counts **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) among its winners.


The video game group rose more than 14% in the past four weeks. The tech sector's security software, data storage, tech services and networking industry groups have climbed more than 10%.

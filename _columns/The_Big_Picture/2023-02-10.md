====================================================================

The stock market ended the week lower Friday, but declines were modest ahead of next week's market-moving CPI report.




The Nasdaq had the toughest time Friday, skidding 0.6%.Â A five-week winning streak came to an end, as the index booked a weekly decline of 2.4%.


Nevertheless, this looks like a constructive pause because the stock market has rallied furiously since the start of the year. [A power trend remains in force](https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-enters-rare-power-trend-here-are-3-ways-to-profit/?src=A00220), with the 21-day exponential moving average easily clear of the 50-line.


The S&P 500 managed to turn in a slender gain for the day of 0.2%, though it fell more than 1% for the week. The benchmark index managed to hold support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared best in Friday's stock market, gaining 0.5%. It found support at its 10-week moving average despite losing 0.2% for the week. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was the top component on a good day for energy stocks while **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) lagged.


Small caps showed grit, lifting the Russell 2000 0.2%, but this all-important market group fell 3% for the week.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ended the session virtually flat and is continuing to hold clear of its 10-week moving average.


CPI Report Looms Amid Fed Inflation Fight
-----------------------------------------


The Federal Reserve wants to persuade the market it is serious about the inflation fight but Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a measured tone when he appeared at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.

With strong jobs strengthening hawkish monetary policy, everyone will be watching January consumer price index (CPI) Tuesday, which is expected to rise 6.2% year-over-year.


A higher-than-expected number will increase pressure on central bankers to continue raising rates. On the flip side, a cool number will add further fuel to the current stock market rally.


At this stage, the market remains in a confirmed uptrend and 60% to 80% exposure makes sense. But stay nimble and continue to pay attention to sell signals flashing among your stock portfolio.


Stock Market Week Energy Stocks Fare Best
-----------------------------------------


Despite mixed action, many S&P 500 stock market sectors ended Friday higher. Energy and utilities led the upside while technology, communication services and consumer discretionary lagged.


The relative performance of IBD's industry groups offered a more granular view into the action.


Oil & gas dominated the top spots, with domestic and international explorers and producers, drillers, refiners and field services the most profitable venues.


Travel and leisure stocks, auto manufacturers, educational software makers and trucking equipment issues were the weakest. Internet retailers and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX))-dominated movie group also lagged.

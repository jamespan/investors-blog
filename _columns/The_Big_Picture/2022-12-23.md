Santa Claus Comin' To Town? Stock Market Grinds Out Gain As Energy Stocks Shine
================================================================================

The stock market managed to shrug off negative sentiment to end a tough week on a high note Friday. A Santa Claus rally next week would be most welcome after a grim year.




The S&P 500 rallied out of the red to end the session up 0.6%. This means the benchmark index gave up minuscule losses for the week and failed to remount the broken 50-day moving average. It is now down nearly 20% so far this year.


The Nasdaq composite also fought back from negative territory, though its gain was a miserly 0.2%. The tech-heavy index ended up slipping 1.9% for the week and it has work to do to break its downtrend. It is faring far worse than the S&P 500 this year, giving up nearly 34%.


Blue chips continue to outperform on a relative basis.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to close the session with a gain of 0.5%. It also stood out by making a 0.9% gain for the week. Oil major **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) was the clear star with a gain of 3.1%, almost double that of nearest index rival **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)).


Small caps also ended the day in positive territory, with the Russell 2000 closing up 0.4%. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.3%.


Volume was down on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, no surprise on the last trading day before Christmas. Advancers outnumbered decliners about 2-1 on the NYSE but held a slight edge on the Nasdaq.


Santa Claus Rally Ahead?
------------------------


Stock market investors had to weigh up mixed economic data on Friday, including a weaker-than-expected reading for durable orders. Also, November personal consumption expenditures (PCE) came in cooler than expected, though core CPI inflation rate hit 4.7%, higher than the 4.6% consensus.

There was also an improved Michigan Sentiment report and an unexpected uptick in new home sales.


"If today's trading is any indication, investors are counting on a Santa Claus rally in 2022-23 to place a green cap on an otherwise red year," CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall told IBD. "This year's 19.8% YTD decline in the S&P 500 is the third worst since 1945, behind the mega-meltdown years of 2008, 1974, and 2002."


He also said next week's action could be more volatile than normal due to low trading volume.


Energy Plays Among Stock Market Winners
---------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all closed positive. Energy and communication services fared best while health and technology posted the slimmest gains.

Oil & gas plays dominated the day's rankings, with explorers, producers, oil services and drillers among top performers. Media, periodical and newspaper stocks also did well.



On the downside, medical biotech plays, streamers including **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), solar stocks and medical software firms were among the worst performers.

=================================================================

The Nasdaq on Thursday suffered its worst loss in almost two weeks, as chip stocks plunged on a weak outlook for smartphone sales. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gapped down 2.8%, taking guidance from the glum chip news.




Although the U.S. indexes lost ground, the major indexes closed above their 50-day moving averages.


The Nasdaq sliced 0.8% lower, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 4.3%.

Volume increased on the Nasdaq but fell on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MPb041918-237x300.jpg)The increased volume combined with losses in the Nasdaq met the definition of distribution for the composite. This was the first sign of institutional selling since the April 10 [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day confirmed that an uptrend was underway.


Distribution involves falling prices in rising trade, the footprint of institutional selling.


On Thursday, **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) triggered the [selling in the chip space](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/taiwan-semiconductor-apple-falls/). The megacap chipmaker said demand was weakening among high-end, mobile customers.


Taiwan Semi's stock lopped off 6% in heavy volume, falling below the 200-day moving average.


The chip sector plays a strong role in the economy and in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).Â In February, the most recent data available, worldwide chip sales rose 21% vs. the year-ago period. It was the 19th consecutive month of increases vs. the year ago, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The chipmaking industry group sometimes tops before the broad market does, so weakness in the group needs to be watched.



Despite the overall selling, some areas of the market were doing fine.


The day's leadership on the upside was peculiar, considering recent sessions.


Among 197 industry groups, one sector pocketed seven of the day's top 20 industry groups. The seven were all from the banking sector.



This was odd, given that banks have gotten only grief from recent quarterly beats. The situation changed Thursday.


**Texas Capital Bancshares** ([TCBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCBI)) reported late Wednesday a 72% pop in quarterly earnings, topping the Street's consensus estimate by 2%. The stock gapped up almost 8% Thursday.


California-based **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) reported earnings before Thursday's open. Quarterly earnings increased 28% for a 13% beat of the Street. The stock gapped up 6%.


Portland, Ore.-based **Umpqua** ([UMPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMPQ)) barreled almost 7% higher. Quarterly earnings growth came in at 67%, which was 25% greater than the consensus estimate.


**Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) grew quarterly earnings 25%, about 15% above the consensus view. The stock gapped up almost 6%, retaking its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.


Each of the four stocks made their moves in heavy volume.


Unloved Bank Stocks
-------------------


Why the sudden shift in sentiment toward banks?


Part of it may have been linked to yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.91%. But the 10-year yield has been trending higher for much of the year.


The market had no news-based explanations. The oddity is that banks found no love from the market when they reported good quarterly results earlier in the week.


On Thursday, bank stocks might not have found love, but the market apparently decided it was time to keep banks in the game.


Friday's session could add yet another page to the bank story. **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)) and savings and loan **Synchrony Financial** ([SYF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYF)) will release Q1 results before Friday's open.


On the negative side Thursday, besides the chip group, tobacco and soap were pulling the market down.


The bears, though, failed to summon the power to push the major indexes back below their 50-day lines. That test will continue Friday.


Economic News
-------------


The news Thursday was on the light side.


Jobless claims came in only slightly lower than expected.


The Philadelphia Fed's April business outlook survey rolled in at 23,2, topping the consensus estimate for 20.1.


Leading indicators for March rose 0.3, matching analysts' expectations.

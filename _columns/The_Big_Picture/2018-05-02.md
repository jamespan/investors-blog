Perhaps few on Wall Street expected the stock market to make an overly dramatic move Wednesday, up or down, after the Federal Reserve announced no change in the cost of money on Wednesday. Small caps quietly forged small gains.




Yet true to the current outlook for stocks, the major indexes staged a negative reversal at a time when stocks in general are showing some fatigue after an excellent run last year.


Plus, volume rushed higher on both exchanges on Wednesday vs. the prior session, signaling fresh [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/).


The Nasdaq composite went from an early 0.5% lift to a 0.4% drop by day's end. Much of the selling arrived after the U.S. central bank met wide expectations on Wall Street that it would not shift on short-term interest rates.

What Is The True Target Now?
----------------------------


As IBD noted, the Federal Reserve was mum on its [view toward inflation](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/no-fed-rate-hike-but-dow-jones-stalled/) following a two-day meeting that ended Wednesday. The Fed noted that overall inflation and core inflation figures "have moved close to 2%" over the past 12 months. But the central bank also appeared to signal that an inflation rate above 2% is acceptable, calling it a "symmetric" target.


Was the lack of clarity a reason for the late-afternoon sell-off? No one can say for sure. But this is crystal clear: While overall good earnings results are helping sustain investor confidence in U.S. equities, institutional trading desks are being very vigilant about the potential for "policy error" by the Fed in its steps to restore at least some normalcy to interest rates.


"We expect a slight global slowdown in economic growth this year, but it's still above trend and robust enough to carry risk assets," Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors, told IBD earlier this week at the Milken Institute global conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.


But Shah warns that further strength in crude oil prices, a pickup in inflation, and the potential for a "policy error" by the Fed in raising rates too fast would definitely hit equities hard if the economy undercuts growth expectations.


Last week, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond spiked above 3% for the first time in more than four years. On a percentage basis, it's quite a leap from the near-term low of around 1.37% seen in July 2016.


Economic Reports Miss Forecasts
-------------------------------


Indeed, a few recent monthly measures on the U.S. economy — including personal income, pending home sales and the ISM manufacturing survey — missed the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


The major averages are now accumulating a lot of bumps on their heads as they try to break above their 50-day moving averages. The Nasdaq continues to swim underneath the 50-day line since sinking below it on April 20. (See the 50-day line on the large daily charts for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 via the General Market Indicators PDF at the bottom of this article.)


Stocks Diverged In This Way
---------------------------


However, in a curious divergence on Wednesday, winners mildly exceeded losers by nearly 200 issues on the Nasdaq. Few true market leaders are sliding down heavily in price. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) and [Leaderboard names](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) continue to hang tough.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund edged nearly 0.2% higher. The basket of top growth companies raced 34% higher in 2017. The ETF is flat for the year.



**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) showed why solid earnings and sales still matter, while a new company such as **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) can inspire heavy selling when results wither.


The former notched a fifth quarter in a row of double-digit EPS growth. The 30% year-over-year increase to $2.73 a share by Apple was its biggest in years. Sales accelerated as well, rising 16% to $61.14 billion.


Snipped, Again
--------------


Snap plunged more than 21% and made all-time lows. The "camera company" [posted a net loss of 17 cents a share](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-first-quarter-earnings-report/). The Silicon Beach-based company has now bled a cumulative $1 a share in red ink over the past seven quarters.


The social media network's revenue grew 54% to $231 million, but it's the smallest top-line gain in at least nine quarters.



Apple may be, in some folks' eyes, an "old" company. That's a misnomer. The company is killing it in the digital services space, reaping 20%-plus revenue gains. Outside the iPhone business, Apple has been introducing new products as well and showing significant growth.


A pledge to buy back up to $100 billion worth of stock is another significant new announcement, as Apple has proved to be one of the biggest turnaround stories on Wall Street since its January 2017 breakout at 118.12. Now the stock appears to be building a new base that carries the elements of a [mild double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). If that's the case, 179.04 is the [new breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



Apple rallied 55% from that cup with handle in January last year to its recent all-time high of 183.50.

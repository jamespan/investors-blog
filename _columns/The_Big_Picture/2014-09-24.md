Was it sellers' fatigue? Or another salvo of buying by rejuvenated bulls? Either way, Wednesday's session proved to favor the latter as the long-in-the-tooth bull market stayed intact.

  

The Nasdaq composite rose 1%, matching the 1% move it made on Aug. 13. Volume was a shade lower. Biotech, ethical drug, solar, software and some retail stocks rallied sharply.

  

That Aug. 13 up session is an important one for the market, for the Nasdaq staged a follow-through that day, triggering a new uptrend.

  

Other key indexes were not far behind on Wednesday.

  

The S&P 500's 0.8% rebound in slightly higher turnover snapped a mild three-day losing streak. The Russell 2000 rallied 0.9%. The Dow utilities slipped 0.2%.

  

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both weathered a challenge of support near the 50-day moving average. (See the dotted line on both daily charts on B2.) Winners topped losers on both exchanges, nearly 3-to-2 on the NYSE.

  

What spurred the rebound? Some pointed to a better-than-expected U.S. new home sales report; others noted reports speculating on a change of guard at the People's Bank of China.

  

A less apparent factor could very well be the current state of the investor's mind. A constant barrage of headlines of pessimism and fear over the fight against the Islamic State, the menacing Ebola virus and the European economic slump may have spurred recent sell-offs, keeping the rally in check.

  

When the wall of worry is tall, fewer traders are willing to buy stocks. Pessimism helps keep the market from boiling over.

  

Investors Intelligence on Wednesday reported that bullishness among the pundits fell to 48%. Bearishness is still low at 15.3%, but the ratio of newsletter editors predicting a mild correction is relatively thick at 36.7%.

  

The put-call volume ratio, meanwhile, is elevated. At 0.98 in Wednesday's paper, it means that investors are buying nearly as many bearish puts as they are bullish calls. Finally, ThinkAdvisor.com reported that the Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism index jumped in the current quarter to +46, but it still "lags the pre-2008 recession 12-year average of just under +100."

  

The IBD 50 surged 1.7%, a strong indicator that the appetite for dynamic growth companies is still solid. Each bull market cycle is driven by the most innovative companies. Today is no different.

Stock Market Tone Improves As Nasdaq Surges, S&P 500 Hits New High; These Risks Remain
=======================================================================================

It doesn't take long for the stock market's mood to change, and the past week proved the point as the market quickly turned from bearish to risk-on. Yet, some risks have to be dealt with.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 made bullish [follow-through signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) over the past week, and the latter index is making record highs.


Growth stocks are rebounding after several weeks of underperformance. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose more than 2% for the week, while iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) was flat. Still, growth has some catching up to do: The growth index is 4% from new highs while the value ETF is still near record highs.


On Thursday, the Nasdaq added 1.8% after gapping up at the open, in a second straight day of solid gains. The composite closed just above its 50-day moving average after spending two weeks below it.

It would do the Nasdaq some good if it can make a decisive move above that line. Also, the Nasdaq is coming up against a test of possible resistance around the 13,600 level.


S&P 500 Hits Stock Market Record
--------------------------------


The S&P 500 rose 1.2% and hit a new high as it closed above 4,000 for the first time ever.


The Feb. 25 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is now too old to matter. Also, the S&P 500's surge Thursday left the index more than 5% above the March 3 distribution. So, in just one week the Nasdaq and S&P 500 halved or nearly halved the number of high-volume declines logged over the stock market's February-March slump.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average still tops the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in year-to-date performance. But the Dow was essentially flat the past week as real-economy plays lost momentum. On Thursday, the Dow rose 0.5%. Small caps pitched in with a 1.5% increase in the Russell 2000.


Breadth was unusually bullish, with rising stocks over decliners in a 4-1 ratio on the NYSE and by better than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE; it's much better when big gains come in higher volume.


Semiconductor Stocks Boost Stock Market
---------------------------------------


The energy, technology and communications services S&P sectors did best. In the tech sector, semiconductors stood out: The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gapped up 3.7% and is near record highs.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) gapped up after the memory chip maker [gave a sunny forecast](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/mu-stock-q2-2021-micron-earnings/). The industry got more positive news when **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) announced a three-year, [$100 billion plan to boost manufacturing capacity](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lrcx-stock-semiconductor-equipment-stocks-tsmc-spending-plan/). The news came as the industry faces a shortage of chips for autos and other devices.


Chip-equipment makers **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) broke out of [cup bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), and Lam was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) made a new high in busy trading.


The IBD 50 climbed 2% Thursday, but has more ground to make up. It's down more than 8% from prior highs. Some cyclical and financial leaders rotated into the IBD 50 the past several weeks, but it wasn't enough to make up for the losses in technology and growth.

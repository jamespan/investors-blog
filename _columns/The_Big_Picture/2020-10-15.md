The major indexes fell on Thursday. However, the battle-tested growth investor may be thinking this one question.




Did the positive elements of the market outweigh the negatives?


Let's start with the negatives. The Nasdaq fell nearly 0.5%. All five of the FAAMG megacap techs dropped 0.5% to nearly 2%. (The M in 'FAAMG' stands for **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which eased 0.5%.) The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF sank nearly 0.7%.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor index posted a third straight drop, off almost 0.3%.


Even non-Nasdaq-listed fast-growing techs declined. Just look at **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)), the No. 1-discussed stock on Thursday's [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). The pioneer in edge computing [cratered 27% after issuing bearish guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fastly-stock-plunges-as-trump-pressure-on-tiktok-hits-revenue-forecast/) on Q3 sales. The company hasn't yet turned an annual profit.



Volume for Fastly soared more than five times its average over the past 50 sessions. This week, 90.3 million shares have exchanged hands. That slightly tops the enterprise software group member's float of 89.5 million shares.


Another negative? [Weekly U.S. jobless claims](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) took a turn for the worse. Make no mistake; a weakening labor market, coupled with a new wave of business closures in the coming months, could develop into a serious market headwind.


Now, ready for the silver linings?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP_1x0_101520-207x300.jpg)The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and NYSE composite all began recovering minutes into the regular session. Wall Street had been bracing for a bad day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday expressed strong doubt that a new rescue package to bolster the coronavirus-inflicted economy would take place before the Nov. 3 general elections.


Wait For The Close
------------------


Yet a drop of less than 0.2% for the S&P 500 certainly hurts less than a 1.4% shellacking that the large-cap benchmark endured in the first five minutes of trading. The NYSE composite index finished Thursday off only 6 points, less than 0.1%.


Meanwhile, small caps shined. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF turned a 1.4% early downdraft into a 1% advance. Bull market sessions often start weak, then finish strong.


Leading stocks often move in harmony with the key indexes. Check out the positive reversal in new IPO **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)). Shares in the small cap muscled back above a 56.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a six-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/). Shift4 debuted on the NYSE at 23 a share. Meanwhile, medical research gear maker **PerkinElmer** ([PKI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKI)) has made a disappointing round trip of its two-week breakout advance. But shares, up nearly 1.1% for the day, also found bullish support at the 50-day moving average.


A new base in the leading midcap-growth stock and coronavirus play could form.


Beyond Russell 2000: More Positives
-----------------------------------


The positive breadth of the market posed as a curious and bullish divergence.


Early data showed that winning issues upended losing ones by a 6-5 ratio on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, gainers beat losers by 10 to 9.


At an industry group level, solar, auto retail, oil and gas royalty trust, consumer electronics, drug store chain, international oil and gas exploration, regional bank, clothing, hospital, homebuilder, grains and health care services stocks sang a bullish tune. All of these groups rallied 2% or more on a price-weighted basis, according to preliminary data.

[IBD Live on Thursday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) also discussed the action in U.S. government bonds. As seen on a [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the Cboe 10-year note edged up just 1 basis point to 0.73%. (Take the figure on the chart and divide by 10 to get an effective yield on the long-dated U.S. Treasury debt security.)


Will More Breakouts Hit The Street?
-----------------------------------


If the day-to-day action continues to favor rising stocks over falling ones, then you can also expect another positive trend to keep going: more stocks making new 52-week or all-time highs.


You can survey the field by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), then checking the sector-organized [New Highs List](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-14-2020/).


Looking at Wednesday's action, the fact that a combined 216 companies on the Nasdaq and NYSE touched new highs vs. 29 new lows was significant. But look deeper. Click on New Highs and you'll see the software, retail, finance and business services sectors led with 10 or more stocks each. Medical placed fifth on Wednesday as nine issues claimed a new 52-week peak.

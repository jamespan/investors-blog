The stock market didn’t do much of anything Monday, ending mixed and mostly unchanged, ahead of the start of the two-day Fed meeting. The S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Nasdaq rose less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average logged its highest close for the year, rising 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Friday’s levels.


Declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers on both main exchanges. Small caps underperformed with the Russell 2000 down 0.3%. The IBD 50 gave up 0.1%, buoyed by shares of **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), which jumped 3% in average volume. It’s still in buy range from a 33.01 cup-with-handle buy point.

According to CME Group FedWatch, futures traders put the odds of a rate hike at the April meeting at 27%. For the June meeting, the odds go up to 50%.


Crude oil for April delivery slumped $1.32, or 3.4%, to $37.18 a barrel after Iran dashed hopes of a production freeze to prop up prices. More weak economic data out of China didn’t help matters.


When it comes to overall market action, the bulls have reasons to be encouraged. Distribution, or institutional selling in the market, remains well contained. As of Monday’s close, the Nasdaq showed just two higher-volume declines since the Feb. 17 follow-through day. That’s a big reason why many names like **Domino's** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) are and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), among others, are holding gains after recent breakouts.


With the market in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense to have exposure to stocks, even though making money in growth stocks remains challenging.


The good news is that the stock market is not without its share of decent chart setups.


A rising interest-rate environment is generally not good for real estate investment trusts, but the group doesn’t seem too concerned about the possibility. **CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)), with a dividend yield of 4.9% is setting up in a lopsided base with a 32.01 buy point. **Sovran Self Storage** ([SSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSS)), meanwhile, is also setting up in a similar base with a 114.09 entry.


Also in the group, **Public Storage** ([PSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSA)) cleared a flat base Monday with a 258.08 buy point. It’s still in buy range but volume was only slightly above average.


In the growth space, **Fortune Brands** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) and **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) are carving cup-with-handle patterns.

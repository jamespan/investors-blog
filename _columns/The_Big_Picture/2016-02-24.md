Stocks Rally On The Back Of Oil Rebound; Small Caps, Chips Outperform
======================================================================

Investors should not see the Siamese twinslike behavior of the crude oil and U.S. equity markets these days as a permanent force of nature. But the rebound in perhaps the most critical commodity in the world certainly helped boost stocks higher Wednesday.


The major indexes rebounded after sour starts to finish higher in varying degrees. Volume rose, a warm sign for the bulls.


The Nasdaq composite led the way, rising 0.9% after losing as much as 1.7% in the first hour of trade. The rebound took place practically the same time that crude oil futures snapped higher just before noon ET. Oil contracts expiring in April ended more than 1% higher and above $32 a barrel.


The S&P 500 trailed, up 0.4%. Strength in database software, gaming software and computer networking shares helped the Nasdaq outperform. Even outside tech land, some Nasdaq-listed retailers such as **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), an [IBD Leaderboard stock](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), flexed some muscle.


![MP022516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP022516-223x300.jpg)The Philadelphia semiconductor index rallied 1.4%. Small caps did better than the S&P 500, too; the Russell 2000 jumped 1%.


The number of stocks rising to new highs is still pitifully low. (See the latest list on Page B5.) After a monster run from the March 2009 lows, the market still appears in need of more rest. Yet the recent market action suggests that institutional investors do not want to completely abandon equities.


What are the clues?


One, the breadth of the advance is slowly expanding. On the NYSE, winners pounded losers nearly 2-to-1. The NYSE advance-decline line (on the S&P 500 chart on Page B2) is on pace to rise a second straight week. It's already pushed past a short-term peak in early February.


Two, the market was able to deflect the disappointing miss in January new home sales and an unexpected drop in the [PMI private sector services index](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for February.


Three, while breakouts are still puny in size, fewer stocks are sinking so fast that investors must cut their losses at 7%-8% or less. Instead, pullbacks to or just below their precise buy points are more common. When such action lasts for weeks, expect base-on-base patterns to proliferate. That's not a bad thing, given looming uncertainty over the EU (will Great Britain leave?), China (is its market chaos subsiding?), crude oil (will it avoid a drop to 1990s levels?) and the U.S. presidential election (will it be "The Donald"?)


One disappointment in 2016 so far is the terrible performance of money center banks. In Wednesday's IBD, the group ranked an awful No. 173 out of 197 industry groups for six-month price performance. A healthy banking system is the backbone of long-term economic prosperity.

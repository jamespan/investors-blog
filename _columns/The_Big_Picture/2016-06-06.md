Oil, Small Caps Lead Up Session, But Institutional Buying Scant

It was a good day for the stock market Monday, but bulls looking for meaningful signs of institutional buying were left largely disappointed because gains came in lower volume.


The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.5% each. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%. The IBD 50 lagged, rising 0.3% as strength in **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) was offset by weakness in **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)). Plenty of IBD 50 names are showing constructive chart action, including **Middleby** ([MIDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIDD)), **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **BroadSoft** ([BSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSFT)).


The S&P 500 briefly cleared a key resistance level at 2111.05, its April 20 high, but ended just below it. Still, it made its highest close since Nov. 3. The Nasdaq showed similar action, clearing a prior high of 4969.32. It closed less than 1 point below it.


The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped by one as the April 29 higher-volume decline for both indexes fell off the count due to time. The distribution-day count has fallen quite a bit the past two weeks, another feather in the bull's cap. About a month ago, the Nasdaq’s count stood at nine.


![MP060616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP060616-169x300.jpg)With the market in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense having some exposure to stocks. It’s still a challenging environment for growth investors, but plenty of stocks are acting well, trading tightly near highs. This could presage more price strength, especially if indexes break out to the upside.


Oil and gas names dominated the day’s action as oil prices rose. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas intermediate crude oil for July delivery added 2.2% to $49.69 a barrel. A weak U.S. dollar lifted oil. So did ongoing supply disruptions in Canada and Nigeria.


IBD’s drilling industry group was the day’s top performer, rising nearly 10%, but it’s still recovering from a deep decline, like many other oil- and gas-related groups. Several drillers are building bases, such as **Helmerich & Payne** ([HP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HP)) and **Nabors Industries** ([NBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBR)), but it still could be a tough row to hoe for both due to weak Relative Price Strength Ratings, plus the fact they’re still far off 52-week highs.


The stock market also listened closely to words from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen at a speech in Philadelphia. She didn’t veer much from prior comments but called Friday’s employment report "disappointing" and said she remains "cautiously optimistic" about the path of the economy. She omitted any time reference for a possible rate hike, in contrast to remarks at Harvard last month, when she said the Fed would act "in the coming months."


The odds of a rate hike at the June 14-15 meeting have fallen precipitously after Friday’s dismal jobs report. Not that long ago, odds were around 30%. Now they’re at 4%, according to CME Group FedWatch. For the July meeting, the odds of an increase are 27%.


A screen of stocks with top Composite Ratings that rose in heavy volume didn’t yield too many prospects, but two interesting names made the cut:


* **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) added 1% to 154.36. It closed just above a 154.06 alternate buy point.
* Large-cap **Ingersoll-Rand** ([IR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IR)) also made the screen. It rose 0.2% in heavy volume as it works on a long cup-with-handle base with a 67.58 buy point.

title: Small Caps Lead Stock Market Gains; Late Buying Lifts Nasdaq, S&P 500

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed strongly for the second straight session in the stock market Friday, leaving the bulls feeling pretty good headed into the weekend.




Sellers were kept at bay as stimulus talks dragged on. The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up. 0.6%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) completed a three-weeks-tight pattern. IWM is just below its Oct. 12 high of 164.24.


The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4%, the S&P 500 picked up 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Thursday.


Despite plenty of market headwinds, the three major stock indexes still look pretty good from a technical perspective. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are forming handles and holding support above their 50-day moving averages. The indexes are setting up for possible upside breakouts, but uncertainty about a new stimulus package before the election is holding back the market for now.


![MP102320](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP102320-253x300.jpg)It's certainly not a stock market under distribution at this point, with just one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 shows three distribution days. But one of those days was a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) and the other showed a decline of just 0.2%.


Cup-with-handle patterns for **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) are encouraging. Shopify headlines a busy week of [high-profile earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/facebook-stock-amid-regulatory-scrutiny-fang-stock-looks-fine-ahead-of-earnings/).


A defensive posture is better at this point, rather than aggressively allocating new capital. If you've been putting money to work in recent days, you probably don't have much to show for it. But be prepared if indexes start rising in heavy volume. There's no shortage of bullish charts out there that could yield breakouts.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Despite a strong close for the Nasdaq, a breakout try for **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) didn't get very far. It briefly cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 102.73 buy point, but the stock reversed lower.


The weekly chart of **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)), another recent IPO, shows a classic IPO base with a 90.90 buy point.


The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) lost ground for the eighth time in nine sessions. The exchange traded fund fell 0.3% â€” not bad considering that **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), the third-highest-weighted stock in the fund, crashed more than 10%. Late Thursday, Intel reported Q3 results and disappointing sales of data-center chips.


Competitor **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) rallied 3% on Intel's bad news, but AMD is still below its 50-day moving average. AMD reports earnings next week, along with group peer **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)).


**Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) completed three-weeks-tight patterns Friday, but Insulet is the better-looking pattern of the two. The middle week in Roku's pattern is much wider.

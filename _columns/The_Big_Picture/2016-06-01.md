By itself, the Nasdaq's sixth straight gain on Wednesday and seventh in eight sessions wasn't so impressive. But the way it achieved it certainly was.


The tech-rich composite index, getting help from a variety of industries, inched less than 0.1% higher -- its smallest increase since the recent run began with a 1.2% lift on May 20. Yet the Nasdaq erased an early loss of 0.5% and finished almost at session highs.


![MP060116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP060116.jpg)That's not a bad start for the month of June, following a 3.6% gain in May.


The S&P 500 rose 0.1%. It too finished high within the day's trading range. Such "high closes" are a bullish interpretation of the day-to-day chart action in the major indexes. In May, the S&P 500 rallied 1.5% for its third straight monthly gain.


A better-than-expected print for the ISM manufacturing survey in June apparently encouraged equity trading desks to get busy after the opening sell-off. The ISM index came in at 51.3, signifying expansion among the nation's factories. The result not only beat the Econoday consensus forecast of 50.6 but also eclipsed the high end of the estimates' range (51.0) as well. Construction spending contracted in April by 1.8%, but the March figure was revised upward to show a 1.5% jump in construction.


Volume cooled on both major exchanges.


The S&P 500 closed the day at 2099. It goes without saying that 2100 has served as a pivotal level for market technicians. Since the winter of 2015, it has served as the large-cap bench mark's nemesis. When will it serve as an area of friendly support?


It's useless to predict when that could happen. But it's helpful for the stock picker to know which broad sectors could help hoist the major indexes into higher ground. They may include retail, consumer goods and services, medical, business software and communications technology.


Let's consider the retail and consumer sectors. Amid slowing consumer traffic at the nation's malls, concerns over the "sharing economy" (U.S. car sales fell 6% in May), and lackluster gains for people who rely heavily on fixed income and bank deposits for income, it would be easy to conclude that the American consumer is dead. However, sales and consumer spending still form the backbone of the economy. Even today, the American entrepreneur and newer firms are helping to drive new business, higher sales and rising profits.


Institutional investors clearly recognize that. If all the money of investors went into ETFs, there likely wouldn't be any new bases and breakouts among individual stocks.


The opposite is true.


All deserving of a spot on your watch list are: **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) (which made today's Market Pulse table); restaurant and arcade chain **Dave & Busters** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)); **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) (part of the specialty retail industry group, No. 12 in IBD's 197 rankings); medical sales team management software firm **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)); pharmaceutical ingredients firm **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)); and telecom infrastructure companies **BroadSoft** ([BSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BSFT)) and **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)). Some have already broken out, but others are trading tightly in new bases and may furnish new buy points. The market caps of these market leaders range from $1.3 billion to $14.8 billion.


Wednesday belonged to the small caps. The S&P 600 rallied 0.7%, enough to post its highest close since Dec. 1. That helped pushed the index to within 4% of its all-time peak of 742.23.


The Nasdaq composite lies 5% off its all-time peak of 5231; the S&P 500 is less than 2% below its all-time high of 2134.


When the major indexes trade that close to their respective peaks, it can often mean that institutional buying power is growing. Their strong demand powers new stock breakouts. And if those breakouts stick, expect to see them make their way on to the [new high list](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Keep track of the new highs vs. new lows on a daily basis, and you've really got your finger on the pulse of the market's current leadership.


So, what's hot today? In Tuesday's action, the software, medical, insurance and finance sectors led in terms of stock hitting 52-week or all-time highs. The slow yet steady improvement of business conditions in the U.S. and the likelihood that U.S. interest rates will rise more in 2016 give a nice boost to stocks in these areas. Interestingly, 80 Nasdaq stocks and 77 NYSE-listed names made IBD's new high list on Tuesday, showing an even distribution across both major markets.


Such was the case on May 27 as well; 74 new highs on the Nasdaq, 70 on the Big Board.

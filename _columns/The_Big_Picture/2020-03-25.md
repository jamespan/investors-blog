Stock Market Surges, Then Backs Off On Stimulus Snag; Boeing, Nike Lead Blue-Chip Rally
========================================================================================

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 enjoyed a second day of solid gains Wednesday, helped by news of a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus deal. But stock market gains faded late on reports of a dispute among several senators over unemployment insurance aid in the bill.




After logging its best daily percentage gain since 1933 Tuesday, the Dow industrials added another 2.4%. But the blue chip index more than halved a 1,300 point intraday gain. The S&P 500 also faded late but still rose 1.15%. The Nasdaq reversed lower for a loss of 0.5%, but it was still a tame decline after the index surged 8.1% Tuesday.


Meanwhile, the [coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) continues to spread in the U.S. and Europe. As of 4 p.m. ET, U.S. cases were at 64,563, with 9,707 new cases. New cases continue to spike in Italy, Spain and Germany.


The weekly Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a big drop in bullish sentiment to 30.1% from 34.6% a week ago. The bears now outnumber the bulls by a wide margin, a rare occurrence that has been seen near market bottoms in the past.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP032519-286x300.jpg)The latest bulls reading is also just above a 29.9% reading seen in late December 2018 just ahead of a powerful [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) for the S&P 500. The index on Jan. 4. surged 3.4% in higher volume, confirming a new uptrend on the seventh day of its rally attempt.


Boeing, Nike Lead Dow Jones
---------------------------


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) stock surged in the Dow Jones today, up 34%. Shares are up more than 65% so far this week, helped by a Goldman Sachs upgrade Monday and soothing words from CEO David Calhoun on Tuesday. In a CNBC interview, Calhoun said the company could survive without a bailout. Reuters reported that [Boeing plans to restart 737 Max production by May](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-climbs-737-max-production-restart-near-stimulus-deal/), but the plane still needs to pass regulatory muster to get back in the air.


**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was another strong performer in the Dow Jones. It gapped up sharply after reporting earnings, rising 9%. Like Boeing, though, it's nowhere near a proper entry.


The market's late sell-off showed it remains sensitive to economic news. Stocks pared gains on news that four [Republican senators sought to limit jobless benefits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/bernie-sanders-4-gop-senators-threaten-to-hold-up-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html) in the economic rescue bill. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) threatened to delay the bill if the Republicans persisted.


Despite the late-session selling, it was perfectly acceptable performance for the stock market after huge gains Tuesday. Wednesday marked the third day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite. For the S&P 500, it was Day 2. Prior first-day rally attempts for the S&P 500 since Mar. 2 were immediately met with harsh selling, but that wasn't the case Wednesday. The S&P 500's loss Wednesday never hit more than 1.6%.


Short-Lived Recession?
----------------------


The stock market seems to be growing more optimistic that the coronavirus outbreak will be a temporary setback for the U.S. economy.


Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and current St. Louis Federal Reserve James Bullard on Wednesday generally predicted a short-term hit for the economy followed by a rebound. Keep in mind the economy was on solid ground before the outbreak, with record low unemployment, solid job growth and healthy consumer spending.


In economic news, weekly mortgage applications fell 29% last week from the prior week. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims data will be closely watched Thursday. Claims are expected to surge to 1 million, with consensus estimates ranging from 750,000 to 2.7 million. Claims are expected to shatter the 1982 record of 695,000 claims.


Small Caps Show Bullish Action
------------------------------


The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 1.3% after showing some strength of its own Tuesday, soaring 9.4% in higher volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt. Technically, it qualified as a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), but the index on its own doesn't have a great track record of flagging market bottoms. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are better suited for that.


Stock Market Leadership
-----------------------


If you're in the camp that it won't take long for the U.S. economy to recover, then it makes sense to look at a sector that was performing well before the coronavirus stock market crash.


Semiconductor stocks like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) bear watching due to improving charts. While many growth stocks have pulled back sharply off their highs, Nvidia and AMD kept their pullbacks contained and found support at their 200-day moving averages.

Inphi, meanwhile, gapped above its 200-day line Tuesday and extended gains Wednesday. All three stocks continue to work on potential bases, but a breakout for Inphi over a trend line is in the cards.


The vast majority of growth stocks still need more time to complete bases, but if a follow-through comes sooner rather than later, targeting trend line breakouts is a viable strategy. **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) is another stock with leadership potential that could try to clear a trend line soon. DocuSign, **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) are in a select group of enterprise software makers with still-bullish charts.


Remember to start small in case a follow-through doesn't work. It's entirely possible that a follow-through signal will fail after the Nasdaq's vertical violation in February: Starting on Feb. 20, it went into free fall, falling five times in six sessions and sharply undercutting its 50-day moving average.


Bullish gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) included Chinese stocks **GDS Holdings** ([GDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDS)), **Yum China** ([YUMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUMC)), **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)), **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)).

  Small-Cap Stocks Lead Quiet Post-Christmas Session; Nvidia, TSMC At Buy Points

The stock market closed narrowly mixed in a quiet post-Christmas session Thursday, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes held near record highs as 2024 winds down.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1%, extending a win streak to five sessions. The S&P 500 inched lower, as did the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which closed above 20,000. But the small-cap Russell 2000 index outperformed with a 0.9% gain.




Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with financials and health care rising the most. But even those gains were mild. The consumer discretionary and communication services sectors were the day's biggest losers.


The 10-year Treasury yield traded as high as 4.64%, its highest level since early May, before reversing lower to settle at 4.57%. The reversal appeared to help small caps.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Tuesday's abbreviated session. But that's no surprise at all, because the market closed early Tuesday before taking Wednesday off.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP122624-272x300.jpg)


During this week's rebound, IBD upped its recommended exposure level to 80%-100%. And Thursday saw more constructive action, as the major stock indexes shrugged off early losses to close with mild declines. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are within striking distance of new highs heading into the end of the year.


Despite the recent strength, investors should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). It's important to monitor positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.


If the market continues to rebound, then be on the lookout for stocks breaking out past correct buy points. But relatively few stocks are setting up.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured no new stocks, while the Near Pivot list has increased to seven stock ideas. **Yum China** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) is approaching a 51.44 buy point in a cup with handle.

Stocks Market Leaders: Fortinet, Nvidia, TSMC
---------------------------------------------


Stock market leaders to watch include **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).



Cybersecurity leader Fortinet is tracing a flat base that shows a 100.59 buy point following sharp gains in recent months, per [IBD MarketSurge chart analysis.](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Bullishly, the relative strength line is holding near highs as well.


Nvidia inched lower, snapping a four-day win streak and hitting resistance at the 50-day moving average. Earlier this week, the stock's rebound slightly above the 50-day line placed the artificial intelligence giant at an early entry, but the rebound has stalled. Nvidia will form a double-bottom base that offers a 146.54 entry at the conclusion of this week.


Shares are actionable above the 50-day line as well as from clearing a short downward-sloping trendline from the record high of 152.89, as noted in Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nvidia-stock-early-buy-point/).


AI chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, broke out Monday, moving past a 205.63 cup-with-handle buy point. But shares gave up that entry during Thursday's 1.6% loss.

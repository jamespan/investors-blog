 U.S. stock indexes retreated Thursday, shaking off a gut punch from the retail sector.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each lost 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 sagged 0.7%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE volume rose. That means the S&P 500 added a distribution day, which points to institutional selling. That left the S&P 500 unchanged with three distribution days. The Nasdaq drops from five to three distribution days because a stalling day also is erased from the count.

Among the 18 groups within the retail sector, each one was either down or nearly flat with the exception of drugstores.


As IBD noted in an April 10 cover story on [the troubles in retail](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stores-still-have-hope-but-what-about-retail-stocks/), no analyst is "ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail's wounds still run deep."


Analysts interviewed in the story noted that a unique identity and "coolness" are factors that can drive success in retail.


Those who are convinced that the physical store is history should probably rethink their definition of store. One word says why: **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which rose 0.4% Thursday. When the first two physical Apple stores opened in 2001, skeptics predicted failure. They were wrong.


As of April, Apple has 495 stores, recently adding one in Dubai, UAE.


How has the retail slice within Apple's overall business succeeded while others in the retail sphere are struggling?


The key: Apple sees its stores as a "modern town square" — a place where people can come together, learn and be entertained, according to a recent press release that quoted Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president of retail. Thus, there's a "cool" factor at play.


Just dumping inventory at a chain store where clerks can't answer the simplest questions won't cut it anymore.


Despite Thursday's ugly action in retail, some measure of caution should be exercised before investors start shorting retail stocks.


Of the 18 groups inside the retail sector, 10 are up so far this year. Internet retail is up 22%. Consumer electronics is up 14%. Mail order is up 10%. Variety stores are up 9%. Home furnishings and restaurants are up 8% each. Those areas might be a good place to scout for potential breakouts.


The big retail losers so far this year include department stores, off 21%; wholesale auto parts, down 10%; wholesale autos, down 9%; and wholesale office supplies, down 8%.


Another positive for retail is the four retail groups in the top 40 among 197 industry groups — internet, consumer electronics, home furnishings and restaurants.


The retail sector went into Thursday's session up 10.6% since Jan. 1. No doubt that will be adjusted downward because of Thursday's rout, but investors need to take each retail group on a case-by-case basis.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were about 3% fewer than expected.


On Friday, data releases will include retail sales, business inventories and consumer sentiment.


Before the open **J.C. Penney** ([JCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCP)) will report results from fiscal Q1 ended in April. The Street expects a loss of 21 cents a share vs. the year-ago loss of 21 cents a share. Revenue is expected to roll in at $2.77 billion, down 1% vs. the year-ago $2.81 billion.

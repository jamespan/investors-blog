These 4 Factors Hint That This Bull Market Has Legs
====================================================

For many longtime readers of IBD, Tuesday's session likely reaffirmed the conclusion that the [Jan. 4 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) not only marked a potential inflection point in stocks. It also raised confidence that investors can make money in what has become a tradable rally.




News late Monday that Congress has reached a tentative spending deal to avert another serious federal government shutdown sparked a Wall Street rally from the get-go Tuesday. After a solid open, stocks never looked back.


The Nasdaq composite — bolstered by gains in software, chip, internet and retail stocks — enjoyed a gain of nearly 1.5%. The Nasdaq also finished almost at its session high, a show of strength.


The S&P 500 rolled ahead 1.3%. The large-cap benchmark rose far enough in price to knock off the Jan. 16 [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), a type of distribution. Thus, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq now have just one distribution day on the books, the sell-off on Feb. 7.


The Distribution Count On The S&P 500 Falls
-------------------------------------------


Distribution days also expire on time. Once 25 trading days have passed since they occur, they no longer affect the assessment of current market conditions.


Volume climbed sharply on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, up nearly 13% on the former. Translation? Equity trading desks across the land snapped up shares more busily than usual. So chalk up Feb. 12 as yet another day of what IBD likes to call "institutional accumulation."


When the Nasdaq gains that much, if you are a serious reader of this column, then you usually would expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average to lag. Not on Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP021219-219x300.jpg)Cyclicals, in fact, basked in uncommon strength. And if the steel giants in the U.S. (such as **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD))) happened to be part of the 30-stock Dow, then the Dow industrials, also up 1.5% on Tuesday, would have likely outperformed the Nasdaq.


Numerous beaten-down oil and gas firms and banks also participated in the rally. No wonder, then, that breadth in the stock market was superlative. On the NYSE alone, winners trumped losers by a more than a 3-1 ratio. Go to the big S&P 500 daily chart in the General Market Indicators PDF at the bottom of this article. In that chart, please inspect the NYSE advance-decline line. You'll see that it's now reached its highest level since September.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, is aiming to finish on the north side of its 50-day moving average (see the dotted line on the big daily chart of the 500 in the GMI PDF page) for a fourth consecutive week.


Fiercely positive market internals suggest that this rally since the key [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on Jan. 4 has room to run. This is exactly the kind of environment that growth-stock hunters desire.


A New Winner In The Software Sector Emerges
-------------------------------------------


**Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)), a 2015 IPO and small cap within IBD's security software group, exemplified the growing institutional demand for equities.


The specialist in email-based data protection blasted out of a large, deep cup base with a big gap-up. Shares rose more than 13% to 48.69 and surpassed a 46.97 buy point in eight times normal volume. That's not a misprint: Turnover exploded to 3.4 million shares, more than eight times the stock's 50-day average volume of 401,000 shares.



So, did all that volume come from covering of short-sellers' positions? Likely not. As [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows on its weekly charts, Mimecast's short interest was equivalent to only one half of its average daily volume, or around 200,000 shares.


The stock joined 13 additional companies in the software sector to top IBD's [New High list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-feb-12-2019/). The Medical sector ranked second in size with nine stocks making 52-week or all-time highs; Insurance and Chips tied for 3rd with six stocks apiece


The U.K.-based Mimecast posted a 200% jump in fiscal Q3 profit to 9 cents a share. Sales rose 30% to $87.6 million. That stretched Mimecast's streak of 30%-plus, top-line increases to nine quarters in a row.


Mimecast also illustrates the key element of industry group relative strength.


As a general rule of thumb, you're going to have more success with individual growth stocks when they belong to a market-leading industry group.


Here is one of the fastest ways to check industry group relative strength.


How Stock Checkup Speeds Your Research
--------------------------------------


One, look up a stock in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-mimecast-limited-mime.aspx). It will show the exact industry group to which it belongs. Mimecast's security software industry group is basically firing on all cylinders. A No. 9 ranking means that the group is ninth among 197 industry groups for six-month price-weighted performance. Keep in mind, then, that a small industry group with one triple-digit-priced stock will be swayed mostly by that single member of the group.



The [Sector Leaders list of top stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) captures a Mimecast groupmate, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)). The longtime market leader is sculpting a new base. A large cap with a market value of $21 billion, Palo Alto is slated to report fiscal Q2 results on Feb. 26 after the close.


The Street expects earnings to rise 42% to $1.22 a share on a 26% lift in revenue to $682 million.


This IBD ETF Crushes The Dow Jones, Nasdaq
------------------------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) trailed, with a gain of less than 0.9%. Nonetheless, the rebound since the Day 7 follow-through on Jan. 4, as noted in The Big Picture that day, may feel like a warm fireplace on a snowy winter day. Since the Jan. 4 close, FFTY has rallied 16.3%.


A newer ETF, Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)), cruised 1.6% higher to 19.66, notching its highest close since Dec. 3.


4 Key Factors For The Bull Market: No. 1
----------------------------------------


Remember the Goldilocks fairy tale, in which baby bear finds the porridge that's not too cold and not too hot? Wall Street players seem to read or recite this tale every night at bedtime. They essentially want an economy that is not rising too fast, nor too slow. So, keep an eye out for news that hint that the economy is neither getting too hot nor too cold.


Although unemployment is near record lows, wage growth has not gotten out of control and inflation remains relatively tame. Oil prices are rebounding but are still well off their 52-week highs. Manufacturing surveys, meanwhile, continue to show growth but not unsustainable rates of expansion.


Upcoming economic reports to watch later this week? The Empire State manufacturing survey for February, industrial production for January and the February consumer sentiment survey taken by the Univ. of Michigan, all on Friday. The [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), which now features key international data, calls for the Empire State survey to rise to a 7.6 reading after a sharp drop in January.


Bull Market Factor No. 2
------------------------


Interest rates have certainly climbed in recent years, but they haven't reached levels that worry economists. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has been issuing signals that we're close to a "neutral" level for interest rates. In other words, the U.S. central bank is rethinking how quickly it needs to raise short-term interest rates to reach an ideal equilibrium between growth and prices.


Factor No. 3
------------


Investor pessimism still exists in the market. That's good for the bulls. The Investors Intelligence survey currently shows bearishness at 20.6%. That's still above 18.3% at the start of October last year, when the market got hit by big sell-offs in heavy volume. On Oct. 10, IBD's current outlook got downgraded to "market in correction."


On the top of Page A2 in the latest IBD Weekly, the IBD TIPP Economic Optimism Index showed a 2-point drop to 50.3 in February, just above a neutral reading of 50.


Factor No. 4
------------


Top growth stocks are acting well. Plus, a few are now reaching a profit-taking threshold of 20% to 25%, including **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)). Treat the action of leading stocks as the ultimate determinant of a healthy bull market.

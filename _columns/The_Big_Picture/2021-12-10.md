The stock market managed to close the week on a positive note Friday even as inflation reached a 39-year peak.




The Nasdaq composite burst out of the opening gate, and proved its mettle by rallying back out of a dip to close near session highs. It ended the day up 0.7%, helping the index finish its best week since February with a flourish. But volume was not ideal, slipping slightly compared to Thursday.


The Nasdaq managed to close just above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Investors will want to see it carry the momentum forward in the coming week as the stock market tries to get back into a confirmed uptrend after a volatile period.


The S&P 500 also got off to a good start, and ended up faring best out of the major indexes. It closed the day up about 1% at a new closing high, with a dip in NYSE volume.

While the major indexes were squeezing out gains, bears took a bite out of growth stocks and small caps.


The Russell 2000 reversed lower as it gave up 0.4%. Growth stocks fared slightly better, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund falling 0.2%.


A key gauge to watch at the moment is the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). The VIX fell more than 13% Friday as the market tries to get back on an even keel. (You can also view [the VIX on MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) by using the symbol 0VIX (that's a zero).


Inflation Surges, But Consider This
-----------------------------------


The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported early Friday that the [consumer price index jumped 6.8% in November](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-39-year-high-dow-jones-federal-reserve/) from a year ago. This equated to the biggest jump since 1982. On a month-to-month basis, prices were up 0.8% in November compared to a 0.9% rise in October.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said the latest inflation report "did not come in as hot as many were expecting," which benefited stocks.


"Appetite for equities remains undeterred as traders appear to be confident that eventually at some point in the middle of next year a lot of these pricing pressures will fade," he said in a note to clients.


The Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged. The yield on the two-year note fell 0.024%.


The Federal Reserve is getting set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. With inflation rising, bankers are expected to discuss speeding up taper of the Fed's bond-buying program. Investors will be on the lookout for any clues that interest rate hikes are coming.


Oanda's Moya says traders are currently anticipating that the Fed will not be forced to deliver a rate hike well before the summer.

Tech Stocks Gain, But Note This Split
-------------------------------------


An interesting point for investors is the split the past week among technology stocks.



Big cap tech stocks such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which hit a record high Friday, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and chip giant **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) all posted strong gains for both Friday and the week.


But more speculative tech names are suffering at the moment.


Underlining this, cryptocurrency exchange stock **Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) fell 3.1%, streaming media firm **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) tumbled 2.5% and e-commerce play **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) slipped 2.2%.


All three of these names are now trading below the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Industry Group Winners & Losers
-------------------------------


It is important to keep abreast of the best performing industry groups on a given day.


On Friday, periodicals, major discount chains and contract electronics manufacturing led.


On the downside, mail order & direct order, accident and health insurance and consumer electronics fared worst.


Internet retail, home of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), also struggled. The e-commerce behemoth fell 1%, though the likes of **Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)), which fell nearly 8%, and **Overstock.com** ([OSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSTK)), which gave up 6%, were bigger laggards in the group.

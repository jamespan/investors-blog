  Nasdaq, S&P Barely Extend Win Streaks; These Signs Could Mark A Shift For Stock Market

The stock market was barely able to extend its longest win streak in two years, as investors found few catalysts Wednesday. Indexes could be at a turning point, though.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 reversed higher and closed with 0.1% gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, fell 0.1% and snapped its seven-day win streak.


For the Nasdaq, it was the ninth consecutive gain — its longest win streak since an 11-day run that ended two years ago to the day. The S&P 500's eighth straight advance matched a win streak that also ended on this same day in 2021.


Sooner or later, indexes will snap the win streak. The hope is that the stock market can pull back gently. The Nasdaq has rallied nearly 9% from its Oct. 26 low and the S&P is up nearly 7%.


With indexes moderating their big advances, conditions are ripe for a descent. Indexes are testing potential resistance levels. The Nasdaq is near its mid-October highs, which coincide with a trend line touching the highs from the index's July 19 peak.


The S&P 500 also is testing its October highs. Both the Nasdaq and S&P have yet to break a pattern of lower highs and lower lows.


Megacaps Skew Stock Market Performance
--------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP110823-257x300.jpg)As The Big Picture has cautioned before, the largest stocks continue to overstate stock market performance. Invesco S&P Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) has already started its pullback, down a third straight day on Wednesday (-0.2%).


Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) fell in two of the past three sessions and is meeting resistance at its 50-day moving average.


By comparison, the market cap-weighted Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the 100 largest Nasdaq nonfinancials, has already moved above a trend line connecting its highs from the July 19 high. It added 0.1% Wednesday.


Volume eased on the New York Stock Exchange and rose on the Nasdaq from Tuesday's totals. Breadth undermined Wednesday's gains. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by an 8-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and by about 9-to-7 on the NYSE.


Some complacency appears to be building in the stock market. The Cboe Market Volatility Index, better known as the VIX, sank to a seven-week low. Its eighth-straight decline is the worst since the March 2022, when it fell 31.8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Also, small caps have gone back to their lagging ways. The Russell 2000 lost 1.1% Wednesday and is down 2.6% this week. The index's Friday gap up is now filled in.


No Major Selling In Stock Market
--------------------------------



Nonetheless, institutional investors remain buyers. Since the [follow-through in the Nasdaq Nov. 1](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/) and in the S&P 500 the next day, the stock market has yet to suffer a single [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). An exposure level of 40%-60% remains sensible for current conditions.


The stock market had little to work with Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a ceremonial speech that offered nothing in terms of policy views. Powell's [comments Thursday afternoon at a conference](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Seminars/Conferences/2023/11/09/2023-annual-research-conference) of the International Monetary Fund should be more substantial.


Otherwise, the economic calendar remains light the rest of this week.


The 10-year Treasury yield continued to ease, down 5 basis points to 4.52% late Wednesday. The benchmark yield is now below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The easing trend has been a relief for the stock market.


Meanwhile, earnings reports provided some highlights Wednesday.


**Roblox** ([RBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBLX)) surged nearly 12% in big volume, gapping above its 200-day line. Third-quarter [sales and profit beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/research/roblox-rblx-stock-buy-now/). **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) fell 5.7% after its [Q3 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biogen-stock-biogen-earnings-q3-2023/).


Axon, Ryanair Boost IBD 50
--------------------------


The IBD 50 index also rose 0.1% Wednesday.


**Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) led the IBD 50 with a 6.1% jump following the Taser gun maker's third-quarter earnings report. The stock topped an alternative entry at 223.30 in heavy volume.


**Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)), which returned to the IBD 50 Tuesday evening, added 4.2% in heavy volume. The Ireland-based airline is a standout in an industry group that has lost about 40% since a July peak.


 **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) and a few other tech firms also helped the IBD 50. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is above a 614.36 buy point.


While this week could end up being quiet, next week has the potential for trouble. Inflation data, retail sales and more earnings reports are on the calendar.


And Congress faces a Nov. 17 deadline on a government shutdown. A settlement could be fraught with uncertainty as it was in September. Congress at that time reached a temporary deal to keep the government running, but the agreement cost then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy his job.


"We believe the risk of a government shutdown ... is rising," a report from Wells Fargo Investment Institute warned on Oct. 31. "There are deep disagreements over spending on border security versus continued aid to Ukraine. Additionally, it is unclear how negotiations will be affected by a new House Speaker and new geopolitical risks."

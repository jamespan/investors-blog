The S&P 500 hit a new milestone as the market advanced Monday in another volume-challenged session.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.5% as it traded above the 2000 level for the first time. It closed a little below the 2000 level. The Nasdaq, which hit a fresh 14-year high, rose 0.4%. Both indexes were up as much as 0.7% at their session highs.


On a slightly down note, the Nasdaq snapped a recent trend of closing near its session highs. But the tech-heavy index still posted its 10th gain in the past 12 sessions. Since the market's Aug. 13 follow-through signal, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been down only one or two sessions each.


Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 and the big-cap Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4% each. The IBD 50 outperformed with a 0.9% gain.


Deal news and optimism for stimulus in the European economy gave U.S. stocks a lift Monday.


Among the day's M&A activity, **Burger King Worldwide** ([BKW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKW)) surged a whopping 20% on news that it's in talks to buy Canadian coffee-and-doughnut chain **Tim Hortons** ([THI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THI)) to lower Burger King's tax bill. Tim Hortons shares tacked on 19%.


The U.S. has a corporate tax rate of 40%, the highest in the world, according to accounting giant KMPG.


Swiss drugmaker **Roche** ([RHHBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHHBY)) agreed to buy respiratory drugmaker **InterMune** ([ITMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITMN)) for $8.3 billion. The news lifted biotechs, the day's best-performing industry group.


While the overall market climbed Monday, the low-volume atmosphere continued. Nasdaq turnover edged up from Friday, which saw the slowest activity since the July 3 half session. Yet volume was again below average.


Volume tumbled on the NYSE.


Volume in the market tends to pick back up around the second week of September, after the Labor Day holiday.


Winners beat losers by a little less than 5 to 3 on the NYSE and about 4 to 3 on the Nasdaq.


More breakouts occurred Monday, which is a good sign for the new market uptrend.


**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) stormed past a 52.08 buy point from a deep cup base in more than seven times average trade. The stock is a new issue and Chinese â€” two traits that can make for volatile trading.


Domestic auto parts retailers **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) and **O'Reilly Auto Parts** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) both cleared buy points in flat bases. But both had light volume.


A stock can still produce gains despite a low-volume breakout. (See Investor's Corner on B4.)

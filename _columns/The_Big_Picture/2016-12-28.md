Indexes Slump, Volume Rises; Is It Time To Sell Some Nvidia Shares Or All?

A sell-off in the tech sector, triggered by a high-volume negative reversal in one of the best growth stocks of 2016, and widespread profit-taking in banking stocks, defined a broad decline in the stock market Wednesday.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which has ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50 for weeks, hit new highs inÂ the opening minutes, but failed to touch 120 by seven pennies. Then it spent the rest of the day in sharply negative territory, sinking 6.9% to 109.25 in the heaviest turnover since its March 16 breakout.


Volume grew on both main exchanges, thus adding a fresh distribution day to the overall count.


![mp122816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122816-215x300.png)Small caps paced the decline. The Russell 2000, one of the top-performing indexes of the year, fell 1.2% and ended practically at session lows. That decline surpassed a 0.9% drop by the Nasdaq composite and an 0.8% retreat by the S&P 500.


Large and megacap industrial stocks slightly outperformed in the sense that they fell less hard. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 0.6%. A couple of the financial components in the Dow 30, **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), showed relative strength by finishing near breakeven in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/).


When a top leading stock such as Nvidia falls in heavy volume, triggering numerous sell signals in the process (including the single largest point drop since the breakout, and the heaviest volume on a down day since the start of its run), the savvy investor takes a cautionary stance toward his or her current holdings.


It's also sensible to refrain against making new buys, both in new stocks and in current holdings that may be near secondary buy points.


An investor also needs to be extra cautious about whether Nvidia's sneeze will result in the entire tech market catching a cold.


For now, it's too early to tell. True, numerous computer-oriented names in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) fell 1% to 2%, but volume was nearly bone dry; ditto for the regional banks and financial plays in the premier index of growth stocks.


Given that many of these new leaders that broke out of bottoming bases and thrust 20% to 40% higher past proper buy points since Donald Trump's surprise election win on Nov. 8, the broad decline was natural and actually healthy for a market that has been in a decent uptrend since a rare Day 3 follow-through on June. 30.


On that day, the Nasdaq composite closed at 4842. While the market bears would point to the index's current shyness at the 5500 level, the bulls can point to a solid gain of 13.6% since the market flashed that bottoming signal.


Not every follow-through -- which is usually a gain of 1.25% or more in higher volume on Day 4 of a new rally or later -- works out. But every major market bottom going back to 1900 featured a follow-through day.


How should investors deal with Nvidia today? Those who bought at the proper second-stage cup with handle entry at 33.16 have a thick profit cushion. Given the company's leadership position in the fields of semiconductors for cars, artificial intelligence, data centers, virtual reality and video games, there are "story" reasons to hold through the next inevitable correction.


Following Nvidia's big hair cut on Wednesday, the company's market cap of $59 billion is still a fraction of that of Nasdaq heavyweights such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)).


However, taking some profits now is highly sensible as well. One cannot simply predict how far Nvidia will correct. IBD research shows that the biggest market winners typically form a series of bases, and these bases show corrections of as thin as 10% to as high as 40% to 50%, usually in bear markets. A 40% decline off Nvidia's peak of 119 would send the stock to as low as 71, well below its current 50-day moving average (around 86).


Bases take weeks, if not months, to form. One has to decide if he or she is patient and calm enough to hold through such corrections that can later pay off in the form of a new breakout.


Market rallies usually perish when the distribution-day count, as seen in the accompanying Market Pulse, gets heavy. And eight days of heavy institutional selling on the Nasdaq would normally be serious cause for concern.


But as this column has noted before, that count is inflated by a pair of stalling sessions (up 0.2% on Nov. 29, up 0.4% on Dec. 15) as well as a dubious 0.6% decline in higher volume on Nov. 28, in which the prior session was a half day of trading after Thanksgiving.


The S&P 500 has logged four distribution days. Yet each of those declines have all been less than 1%. The average drop among the four sell-offs is a reasonable 0.6%.


The S&P 500 has rebounded 7% since the June 30 follow-through.


Certainly, market internals were ugly on Wednesday. Losing issues beat winners on the Nasdaq by an approximately 3-to-1 ratio and nearly 5-to-2 on the NYSE. However, as seen in IBD's general market indexes page (see the link at the bottom of this column), the NYSE advance-decline is generally healthy and showing a steady incline.


A rising A-D line means more stocks are participating in the uptrend. Insurance, financial, and some medical issues are showing strength. Relatively new issues **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Glaukos** ([GKOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GKOS)) are building new bases.


Thinly traded **e.l.f. Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) of Oakland, Calif., an Ulta Beauty competitor, is showing resilience near a buy point of 29.02. The Street sees this year's earnings rising 55% to 31 cents a share in 2016 and up 19% to 37 cents in 2017.


Some commodity markets firmed up, led by a 4% jump in natural gas futures. [Crude oil](https://www.investors.com/research/futures/oil-trades-near-17-month-high-crude-market-seen-balancing-in-2017/) is at 17-month highs.


Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury bond markets showed little movement, a hint that the market remains satisfied by the current pace of economic growth and is expecting the Federal Reserve to continue raising the cost of money in 2017.

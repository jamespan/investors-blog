  Stock Market Reverses Higher, Helped By China Trade Comment; Nike Breaks Out

The stock market ended with nice gains in lower volume Wednesday in a session that saw some early volatility — and plenty of upside reversals.




Sellers came into the market during the first hour of trading. Indexes dipped more after the White House released the transcript of President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump asked Zelensky to "look into" 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who previously sat on the board of a Ukranian gas company.


But stocks soon turned higher after Trump said a trade deal with China could come sooner than expected. The stock market's performance Wednesday showed that Wall Street is more concerned about a China trade deal than it is on an impeachment inquiry announced late Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.


Stock Market Rallies
--------------------


After falling 0.7% early, the Nasdaq composite closed just above its 50-day moving average, rising just over 1%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended with gains of 0.6%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 1.1%. It halted a six-session slide by finding support at its 50-day moving average. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP092519-267x300.jpg)Gains for the stock market were good to see, but a similar theme played out Wednesday as beaten down industry groups were among the day's best performers. Steel producers, coal, tobacco and paper stocks outperformed.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lagged early, weighed down by weakness in **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). But the exchange traded fund reversed nicely higher, helped by strong showings from **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)).


IBD's [enterprise software group](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) ended with a gain of around 1% after falling 2.6% intraday. **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) reversed higher in heavy volume after some stiff selling in the stock the past few weeks. Shares rallied 6.5%, but they're still well below the 50-day moving average and 23% off their high.


But one of the last names left standing in the enterprise software group, **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), slumped nearly 5% and closed below its 50-day moving average.


Still, a rising [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) has made a challenging environment for growth investors even more challenging. **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) Sept. 19 breakout looked great early that day, but the Dow stock ended well off session highs and below the buy point. The next day, it fell 1.2% in higher volume.


**Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) broke out powerfully on Friday, but big sellers were in the stock Monday. To its credit, Essent turned higher Wednesday after paying a visit to its 50-day moving average.


The stock market uptrend is under pressure again, but that doesn't mean it's time to go 100% cash and head for the sidelines. Even after Tuesday's distribution day, the S&P 500 still held above its 50-day line and is near highs along with the Nasdaq.


Be patient and conservative but still be on the lookout for new buys. If a new buy doesn't work, don't be afraid to cut bait quickly.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)) did something rare Tuesday. It followed though after Tuesday's breakout over a 32.34 buy point. It was one of the top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up nearly 8% to 35.44.


**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) was a top gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after [reporting earnings late Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-earnings-q1-2020-nike-stock-stalks-buy-point-results/). Nike gapped up out of a cup-with-handle base but ended off session highs. Shares still rose 4% to 90.81. The buy point was 89.45, 10 cents above its Sept. 9 high.


**Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) was another nice winner Wednesday, up nearly 6% to 266.62 on strong earnings. The uniform maker gapped above its 50-day moving average and ended near its session high as it works on a flat base. The buy point is 270.46.

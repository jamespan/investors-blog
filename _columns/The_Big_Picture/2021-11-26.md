A shortened trading week did not stop investors from getting fearful about Covid-19 again.




Following news over the Thanksgiving holiday that scientists are monitoring a new, fast-mutating variation of the coronavirus emerging from South Africa, stocks of all stripes gapped down at the open Friday. Judging by the half-day session's close, the stock market expressed more caution than confidence in the short term.


As the U.S. stock exchanges concluded the regular session at 1 p.m. ET, small caps got walloped the most. A 4.2% drubbing of iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) easily topped declines of 2.5% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 2.3% by the S&P 500 and 2.2% by the Nasdaq composite. That left IWM down 4.6% for the week — its worst showing since a 6.1% sell-off in the week ended Oct. 30, 2020 — and the other three indexes with losses for the week of 2%, 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively.

Treasury Bonds: Safe Haven Again
--------------------------------


While volume fell during Friday's 3-1/2-hour trading session on the Nasdaq vs. the Wednesday's full session, NYSE turnover appears to have risen. If this is confirmed Monday, the S&P 500 will have chalked up a [fifth distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/); the accompanying Market Pulse table will also get revised.


On an hourly basis, NasdaqTrader.com showed volume hit 3.4 billion shares at 1 p.m. ET, [up from 2.2 billion shares at the same time on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DailyPsycho112421.pdf).

Volatility Soars On The VIX
---------------------------


Jitters among options traders no doubt rose.


The Cboe Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, soared 53% to 28.39, hitting an eight-month high. The VIX measures volatility in options on the S&P 500. As seen in [IBD's daily chart of the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), big moves past 25 have led to a number of short-term bounces in stock prices throughout the year.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond sank 15 basis points to 1.49%, Cboe data showed. No wonder banking issues sold off. Crude oil futures settled 13% lower.


As one can witness on a weekly chart, small caps are showing the most bearish action among these four indexes.


The Russell 2000 looked solid in the week ended Nov. 5. The proverbial flag bearer for small caps rallied 6% in energetic turnover and stamped to new high ground. But as of Friday's close, the index had given back those gains and more.


Meanwhile, IWM has fallen 10% from its latest peak. That meets the technical definition of an intermediate correction.



Notice, too, on a daily chart how the ETF slumped back below its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 still sit comfortably above their 50-day moving averages. But closes near session lows hardly inspire confidence.


3 Key Sell Rules In Stocks
--------------------------



At this point, the astute IBD investor will keep losses in new positions tidy. When the action is clearly negative, [cutting losses at smaller than 7%-8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-growth-stock-golden-sell-rule-when-take-losses-fast/) makes total sense. Two more sell signals to watch out for? Keep an eye out for big drops through the 50-day moving average. SPDR S&P Regional Bank ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) slumped 5% and 4.5%, respectively in brisk turnover. They both face a critical test of their 50-day lines.


Also, if you see the leading names of an entire industry group fall by the wayside, that's your timeliest signal of heavy institutional profit-taking.


While cyclical stocks got shocked by sellers, money appeared to flow back into select biotechs.


The iShares U.S. Transportation ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) exchange traded fund dove 3% and came close to touching its 50-day line. The big drop marred the work on a saucer with handle pattern that showed a 281.55 entry point.



**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) gapped up 6% in double its usual volume for a regular session; shares moved further past a 51.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-see-how-to-predict-breakout-with-cup-base/). **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)), a darling of the post-crash 2020 bull run, vaulted 15.8% to a multimonth high in more than triple usual volume. BNTX, now trading 24% off its 464 all-time peak, is making further progress on a [new base of its own](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).

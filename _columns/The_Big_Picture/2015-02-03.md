Stocks Extend Gains As Volume Climbs
=====================================

The stock market surged Tuesday, finding relief in a sharp rebound in oil prices.


The S&P 500 leaped 1.4%; the Nasdaq added 1.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 1.8% rally as its two oil components and nine other stocks rose 2% or more.


Volume increased across the board. Breadth was strong, with winners over losers by 4-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Stocks followed oil prices higher. Crude rallied 7% Tuesday on a refinery strike and signs of inventory buildups. Hopeful signs on the Greek debt crisis also encouraged Wall Street.


Energy, metals and auto stocks led, benefiting from increases in January sales by U.S. carmakers.


With this week's bounce, the market is continuing to stay in a trading range. Since mid-December, every time the Nasdaq has dropped around the 4600 level, it's picked itself back up.


On the Nasdaq 100, the support at recent lows is even more uncanny. The index of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the composite has bottomed around 4100 four times in the past seven weeks.


The S&P 500 has also found support near recent lows, although the index has slightly undercut its lows in this year's pullbacks.


But while support is looking firm, the same can't be said of the upper part of the charts. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have yet to establish a pattern of higher highs, which would be imperative to keep the market advancing.


Several tempering signs are demonstrating that it's best to keep exposure to stocks limited.


The indexes' 50-day lines are flattening, even as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed back above those levels Tuesday.


The market is infected with volatility and faces an uncomfortable number of distribution days.


A glance at the index charts shows how much more volatile they've been this year than in 2014. Each time the market had a follow-through last year, it followed up with smooth advances. But the Jan. 8 follow-through did nothing to cure the volatility.


Earnings reports are moving some leaders. **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)) roared 4% and followed through on last week's breakout after it beat profit expectations and gave a sunny outlook.


But profit reports, of course, also can rattle a stock.


After the close, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) slid after sales missed estimates and the company cited higher food costs.


The IBD 50 lagged Tuesday, rising only 0.7%.


Several IBD 50 stocks are forming bases, and their earnings announcements are approaching, making them worth watching. They include **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) and **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)).


Even after making solid breakouts, many leaders have stalled â€” a key problem of today's market. 


**Idexx** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)), **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) have come back nearly all the way to their buy points. **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) is erasing gains quickly. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is still trying to get going.

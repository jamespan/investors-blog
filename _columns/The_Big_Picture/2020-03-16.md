The stock market suffered another horrific drop Monday, a day after the Federal Reserve took new emergency steps to aid a U.S. economy stressed from the coronavirus pandemic.




The Nasdaq composite plummeted 12.3%, its largest percentage drop in history. It surpassed the 11.35% drop of Black Monday in 1987. The S&P 500 was hammered for a 12% loss and the Dow Jones Industrial Average collapsed 12.9%. For both, it was the second worst day since Black Monday.


The S&P 500 has all but eliminated its gains from the December 2018 market bottom. The Dow already is well below that bottom.


Small caps, many of which are more vulnerable to an economic slowdown, were routed for a 14.3% plunge in the Russell 2000. The IBD 50 fell 11.5%.

The number of Covid-19 cases continues to grow in the U.S. and other countries. In an afternoon briefing, President Donald Trump said the crisis may not ease until summer.


Gaming companies such as **MGM Resorts International** ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)) and**Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) are [temporarily closing their Las Vegas casinos](https://www.investors.com/news/mgm-resorts-stock-wynn-resorts-stock-routed-close-las-vegas-properties-coronavirus/). The industry group was Monday's worst, down nearly 24%. Leisure stocks in general are tumbling as the coronavirus pandemic forces people to avoid contact.


Stock Market Gropes For Bottom
------------------------------


New index lows mean the market has to start fresh in search of a bottom. In a few attempts to get a rally going over the past month, the market has been frustrated each time.


A positive reversal Feb. 28 gave the Nasdaq support at the 200-day moving average, but indexes rolled over. Encouraging gains on March 2 and March 10 — and on Friday — went nowhere.


"The ides of March" is a phrase that refers to March 15 and a feeling of foreboding. That tradition seemed to play itself out, as the Fed on Sunday did not wait for its scheduled meeting and [slashed the fed funds rate by 100 basis points](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-launches-unlimited-qe-cuts-key-rate-zero-percent-dow-jones-futures-plunge/), to 0% to 0.25%. It also set at least $700 billion in securities purchases, resuming its policy of quantitative easing. The Fed's new commitment to quantitative easing is unlimited.


Stock Market Faces A Recession
------------------------------


Despite the Fed's rescue attempts, stock futures plummeted Sunday and the selling continued Monday. The stock market is pricing in a recession, and it's hard to imagine avoiding one at this stage. IHS Markit on Monday forecast a recession beginning in the second quarter.


"With global growth slowing sharply, financial conditions tightening dramatically, energy prices plunging, and  'social distancing' forcing cancellations of sporting events, Broadway shows, dinner reservations, travel plans, conventions, etc., we now expect a sharp decline through June in 'at-risk' personal consumption expenditures (PCE) on services to precipitate a consumer-led recession beginning in the second quarter and lasting through the end of the year," warned Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist at IHS Markit.


Prakken expects GDP will contract at a 5.4% annualized rate in the second quarter. "Even as consumer spending begins to recover during the summer, the legacy effects of the second-quarter contraction of PCE, continuing declines in energy exploration and production, and weak overseas growth will result in negative growth of U.S. GDP averaging about -1.9% (annualized) over the second half of the year."


Coronavirus Plays Hold Up In Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


Some stocks for the bunker mentality of these times are holding up or even advancing. For example, **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), which enables online meetings, remains near the 107.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).


But even some of the coronavirus plays are breaking down as well. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), an antidote to the movie theater, sank deeper below its 200-day moving average. **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) swooned more than 11% Monday.

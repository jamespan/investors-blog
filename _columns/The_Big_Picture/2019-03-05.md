title: Why A Dull Session For Both Indexes And Growth Stocks Still Proves Bullish

Readers of the [Feb. 26 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-fall-calmly-beating-tdow-jones-industrial-average-2019/) may recall how the stock market hardly moved at all exactly one week ago. The column noted that dull action can be good action for both the [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) and for growth stocks.




Tuesday's action presented a deja vu moment for the assiduous investor.


It reminded readers that dull, boring, quiet sessions of trade strengthen the thesis that the amazing snapback uptrend of 2019 is still intact.


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session with "losses" of 0.1% or less. To further accentuate the dullness of the day, the "big" moves came from small caps. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 each fell a little more than 0.4%.


Among key sector averages, the Philadelphia semiconductor index dropped nearly 0.5%, the Dow Jones transports more than 0.8% despite a 0.9% backtrack in crude oil futures.


Leading ETFs, more or less, mirrored the broader action.


The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) fund crept 3 pennies lower to 19.92 in whisper-like trade. The exchange traded fund debuted on the NYSE ARCA exchange on Sept. 13 and continues to be on the mend.



Year to date, the BOUT gain of 14.5% still tops an 11.7% lift by the SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) mega-fund.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), another fund managed by [Innovator Capital](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty), edged up 2 pennies to 32.69, raising its advance since Jan. 1 to a very stout 18.3%.


Volume fell sharply on both exchanges. The men and women working the equity trading desks across the land seemed to spend more effort yawning and stretching than taking orders over the phone or clicking big trades.


Tiny losses, lower volume? Take the session as a positive, not negative. This is especially true given that just a day ago, the Nasdaq logged a third [day of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) — a session of pronounced professional selling — in the past 25 trading sessions. Monday's distribution day was also the second in three trading days.


The Color Of Institutional Selling
----------------------------------


Yet the seriousness of institutional selling matters as much as the quantity.


A 0.3% drop in higher trade on Feb. 28 and a 0.2% ease on Monday, combined, indicate that the seriousness is still at a tame level. The only sizable sell-off seen in the Nasdaq lately? The 1.2% drop on Feb. 7, nearly a month ago.

A confirmed market uptrend can absorb these occasional bursts of big selling. When in doubt, judge the health of the run via the prism of price-and-volume action in the market's true leaders and in the names in your portfolio.


So, what's the bird's-eye view of the leadership landscape? Taking a methodical approach makes a ton of sense. Here's a brief checklist:


[Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders): The list has shrunk a bit, but still shows a decent number of stocks. Tech still dominates the list.


[Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/): Remember when it seemed, back in November and December, that every other third or fourth name on this list and the IBD 50 seemed to have "Property" or "REIT" in its name? Well, that's no longer the case.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint): **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) got yanked off the list midday Tuesday due to its [wild reversal following robust fiscal Q1 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ciena-earnings-cien-stock-q4-2018/) (EPS up 120%, revenue up 20% to $778.5 million). The leading stock in the fiber-optic telecom industry group is trying to hold above a new buy point of 40.26 in a rare ascending base.



[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) trounced the S&P 500's 6.2% decline in 2018 with an 11.8% portfolio-weighted gain. The list currently shows one full position and 13 half-size positions, including Ciena group mate **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)). The stock is currently [extended past a proper 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). It's also rolled well past an alternate buy point in an [outstanding breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/).


A full position is equal to one-eighth of a hypothetical portfolio; so, in a $1 million account, a full position would take up $125,000. A half position would take up $62,500.

Growth Stocks And Market Internals
----------------------------------


Breadth is now neutral. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been shuffling sideways for more than a week, and now shows a slight downward tilt. But it's still minor. A sharper downward slope could indicate a curious divergence. New highs are still beating new lows; at one point on Tuesday, at least 123 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE combined for 52-week or all-time highs, vs. 58 new lows.



On Tuesday, beaten-down big-box retail stocks shone, thanks in part to [a well-received quarterly repor](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/target-earnings-target-stock-kohls-earnings-kohls-stock-q4/)t from industry giant **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)). The stock barreled more than 4% higher in about triple its usual volume. But the large cap is still working on a large base. In other words, no correct buy point has yet to emerge. Instead, specialty retailing names still show more market leadership potential, including **Starbuck**s ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and earnings and sales turnaround play **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) of the rebounding restaurant group.


As the latest ISM service sector survey for February (a strong 59.7 beating smashed the [Econoday forecast of 57.2](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and beat the highest estimate of 58.0) showed, the U.S. consumer is still alive and well.


[Former Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) got showcased in the [IBD 50 Growth Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) feature, and its payment processing group continues to thrive in the market.



Industry group mate **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is also in buy range from a 145.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a base that features [elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).


Did you know that Visa is now the third-largest component in the SPDR Technology ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK))? Money is also a tech play.

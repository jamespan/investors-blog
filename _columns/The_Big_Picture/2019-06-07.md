The stock market made strong gains Friday, ending a string of weekly losses and giving positive signals after the odds for a rate cut increased with the latest jobs report.




The Nasdaq streaked ahead 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1% each. Small caps as gauged in the Russell 2000 chipped in a 0.7% gain.


Volume in the stock market was lower on the NYSE but slightly higher on the Nasdaq.


Action in the Nasdaq met the requirements for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/): a muscular gain in volume up from the previous session.

Trump's Standoffs
-----------------


President Donald Trump's stalemates with Mexico and China on tariffs and trade issues have unnerved bulls and bears alike.


Bulls have learned not to take Trump at his word. Bears also have found his policy U-turns hard to predict.


As a result, the Street has been left to struggle with a news-driven stock market.


Jobs Data Sparks Reaction
-------------------------


On Friday, the stock market got a break. Data set the tone, though in an unexpected way.


The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that [jobs added in May came in at an anemic 75,000](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/may-jobs-report-dud-75000-jobs-fed-rate-cut-dow-jones/) â€” below every estimate in the range.


The data fit an economic-slowdown scenario, but not necessarily a recession.


Wall Street took the glum job numbers and made something better.


The Street decided that weak numbers will make the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates. The Fed will meet June 18-19.


Three Items To Consider
-----------------------


Not every bull welcomes a new uptrend signal at this juncture.


Three items are deserving of consideration:


First, the sharp, vertical action that began the correction often stuffs the next rally. Follow-throughs sometimes fail after a sharp decline like what occurred in May, and last October. Also follow-through days in June have a history of failure, though a June 2016 follow-through worked.


Second, the causes that inspired the correction are still in place. Tariff and trade issues are unresolved.


Third, breakouts are occurring, which is a positive factor. After a positive market signal Friday, there are good stocks in buy areas or approaching entries.


Recent breakouts included database platform developer **MongoDB**, casino operator **Eldorado Resorts** ([ERI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERI)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), French yogurt maker **Danone** ([DANOY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DANOY)), paints maker **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)), payment processor **Qiwi** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)) and educator **Grand Canyon Education** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)).


The S&P 500 retook its 50-day moving average, the first of the major indexes to do so.

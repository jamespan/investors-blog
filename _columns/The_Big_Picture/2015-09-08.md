Indexes Mark Follow-Through Rally As Nasdaq Leads
==================================================

Stocks rose sharply Tuesday, triggering a bullish signal for the market. The Nasdaq surged 2.7% and the S&P 500 2.5%. Even for the volatile market lately, those were sizable jumps. Volume rose.

  

The combination of big price gains and higher volume resulted in a follow-through signal — a confirmation of the rally that began with the dramatic Aug. 24 index lows.

  

The rally changed IBD's market outlook to confirmed uptrend — that is, market risk is back to an acceptable level. With a follow-through now in place, investors can venture out of the safety of cash and start adding shares.

  

Traders were back from the Labor Day weekend, making the increase in volume seem almost effortless. Nasdaq volume, in fact, was lower than average and couldn't even match Thursday's total.

  

So, while the ingredients for a follow-through were in place Tuesday, there was reason to be suspicious about the signal and to remain cautious about diving back into stocks — especially while volatility remains so high.

  

In the 10 sessions after the Aug. 19-24 market implosion, the Nasdaq has moved more than 1% six times. Two other days featured intraday price swings of more than 1%. In nine of the 10 days, the Nasdaq closed at the day's extremes — near session highs or lows.

  

All that activity implies a schizophrenic market and one that may have difficulty staying on task. Volatility doesn't tend to stop suddenly.

  

If the follow-through has question marks, the charts of most leading stocks aren't so appetizing, either.

  

A scan of the IBD 50 shows the vast majority barely forming the lows of new patterns. Some of those bases are wide and loose, meaning that they could be riskier bets. It suggests that the market may still have more mending to do.

  

Some leading stocks are finding support at their 50-day moving averages, and that's where some more immediate buying opportunities exist.

  

Check the charts of **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)), **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)), **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)), for example.

  

**Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) is trying to break out. Communications equipment maker **Motorola Solutions** ([MSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSI)) (not an IBD 50 member) broke out of a cup-with-handle base Tuesday.

  

Indeed, the degree to which investors can find breakouts will largely determine their exposure. If more top stocks reach buy points, it will be easier to add stocks to portfolios.

  

There are some pockets of strength in payment processing (where **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)), Total System and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) are leaders), airlines (Alaska Air, **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)), and some medicals (Icon, **Sucampo Pharmaceuticals** ([SCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCMP)), **Mednax** ([MD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MD)).

  

The IBD 50 surged 3.1% Tuesday, its best day in nearly two weeks.

  

There wasn't a single, clear reason for the big rally. Chinese markets, which this week are back from their own holiday weekend, jumped 2.9% to 3.8%. Strong German trade data in July may have helped boost buying.

  

Chips, biotechs, oil drilling and mining stocks were among the best on Wall Street. Advancing stocks led decliners by roughly 7-to-2 across the board.

title: Indexes Steady As Stocks Seek Direction. These Levels Remain A Headache.

After a couple of weeks of volatility, major benchmarks returned to calm trading Monday as the stock market looks for direction and faces another batch of big headlines.




The heavy part of first-quarter earnings season is over. By Friday, 85% of the S&P 500 companies had announced results, according to FactSet.


But Wednesday morning, the April consumer price index will be announced. Economists expect prices to rise 0.4% from the previous month, after easing to 0.1%. On an annual basis, the consensus forecast is for an increase of 5%, same as in March.


Then on Thursday, the April producer price index will offer a look at inflation at the wholesale level.


In addition, four Fed officials are scheduled to [give speeches during the week](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


Ahead of those events, indexes were the quietest they've been in more than a week. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2%, quietly making its highest close of the year. The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Friday's levels.


The IBD 50 Index outperformed with a 0.4% increase. **Revance Therapeutics** ([RVNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVNC)), a relatively new name to the IBD 50, led with a gain of nearly 6%. The maker of cosmetic treatments reports Q1 results Tuesday after the close.


With a 4.1% gain Monday, **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)) extended its three-day post-earnings rally to 35%.



In another boost to the IBD 50, **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) broke out of a cup base with a 76.40 buy point.


After Volatile Period, Indexes About The Same
---------------------------------------------


Stock market indexes came through a 10-day period of higher volatility no worse for wear.


The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow held support at their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) despite [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) piling up over the past two weeks.


The weekly chart of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 don't look particularly threatening. Both closed the past two weeks near weekly highs. An uptrend from the mid-March low has moderated but hasn't failed.


At the same time, indexes face the same levels of resistance that have dogged the market all year.

The S&P 500 has not climbed above 4200 so far this year, but it got within five points in early February. At the same time, the Nasdaq has run into sellers around 12,250. The Dow hasn't done much better, failing to hold above 34,000 for more than a couple of weeks.


Indeed, this rangebound market is still looking for direction. The Fed's pronouncements, economic data and earnings reports haven't been enough to break the stock market from an unclear path.


Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research, says a change in market behavior may not happen for a while.


"Macro data is no longer moving the needle and catalysts that we would expect to be big drivers — such as earnings, Fed data, and geopolitical instability — are not causing substantial market moves," he noted in a report Monday.


"However, since the market is up and there is money on the sidelines, we may be reaching an inflection point over the next several months where institutional investors start to shift their mindsets and re-enter the market intentionally and over a sustained period of time," he added.


Stock Market Direction And Exposure
-----------------------------------


The NYSE advance-decline line is lagging even while the S&P 500 has come close to new highs in the past few weeks. The Nasdaq's A/D line shows an even steeper lag. Keep in mind that the NYSE historically tends to have a better A/D line than the Nasdaq.


Market uncertainty and weak breadth are two reasons IBD's current outlook is "uptrend under pressure." An exposure level of 20%-40% is prudent until the market can offer more signals.


Meanwhile, another threat is emerging in D.C., where the federal government may default on its bonds by June 1. While most consider that a remote possibility, financial markets are already reacting.


Credit default swap (CDS) rates for U.S. government debt have about doubled over the last month as investors demand a higher premium for the potential default risk.


Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a report. "For context, CDS rates reached only 0.80% during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, about half of where rates are today."


The bond market showed its concern last week, when four-week Treasury bills were auctioned at the highest discount on record, yielding 5.84%.


The 10-year Treasury yield Monday climbed 7 basis points to 3.52% Monday. The two-year yield rose 8 basis points and went back above 4%.

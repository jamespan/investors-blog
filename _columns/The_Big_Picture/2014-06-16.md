Market Edges Up, But Leading Stocks Shine
==========================================

Stocks chopped around and ended mildly higher for a second straight session Monday. But it was the leaders that gave a strong showing.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.2% and the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%. They were up as much as 0.4% and down as much as 0.3% during the session.

  

Small caps outperformed as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.4%. The IBD 50 climbed 0.9%, more than quadrupling the Nasdaq's gain.

  

Among leading stocks, **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) extended its win streak to 13 straight sessions. Its gain from a breakout past a 76.82 buy point has nearly reached 20%.

  

A 20% gain is a target at which investors could take profits. But in this case, investors may want to hold. A key IBD rule states that stocks that rise 20% within three weeks after breaking out should be held for at least eight weeks, unless sell signals appear. Diamondback broke out June 2.

  

**Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) ramped up to an all-time high in more than twice its average trade. **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) blew past a 36 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in volume that surged 123% above average.

  

Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq from Friday's pace, but trading was up sharply on the NYSE. NYSE turnover may have been boosted by a barrage of buyout reports.

  

Among the big ones, medical device maker **Medtronic** ([MDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDT)) announced Sunday that it would acquire **Covidien** ([COV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COV)) for $43 billion in cash and stock. **Level 3 Communications** ([LVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVLT)) agreed to buy **TW Telecom** ([TWTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTC)) in a $5.7 billion cash-and-stock deal.

  

Monday also brought about better-than-expected data on homebuilder sentiment, industrial production and factory activity in the New York region. On a down note, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth outlook for the U.S.

  

M&A news and positive economic reports generally make for strong gains in the market. While the market had these factors going for it on Monday, gains were modest. But that was perhaps due to nervousness from continued fighting in Iraq and the start of the Fed's two-day meeting Tuesday. The market has shown it is still sensitive to interest-rate talk.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are only about 1% off their recent highs after a strong rally from mid-May. But the market seems like it could be too bullish for its own good. The number of bullish advisors in the Investors Intelligence sentiment report is at a level that contrarians would interpret as bearish for the market.

  

But that's a secondary indicator. Focus instead on price and volume of the major indexes.

  

The level of distribution in the main indexes is still relatively low since the new market uptrend was confirmed May 27, which is a good sign.

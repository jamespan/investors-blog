The Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 might be at the top of their upper channel lines again, but several software stocks exploded higher in the stock market Wednesday, helped by bullish [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-earnings-crm-stock-q202020/) from **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).




Strength in a variety of software-related industry groups helped lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of 1.7% by the close and another all-time high. A wave of selling hit the Nasdaq between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. ET, but the selling was short-lived. The S&P 500 held its own, rising 1% to a record high, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.3% gain. Small caps sat out the rally, with the Russell 2000 down 0.6%. Nasdaq volume was nearly unchanged from Tuesday's level. NYSE volume rose slightly.


[Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq on Aug. 7 and Aug. 14 fell off the count by Wednesday's close because the index rallied 5% from its closing price on both days. That leaves one on the Nasdaq and one on the S&P 500 — practically no heavy institutional selling.


Breadth was curiously weak, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers on the NYSE by 8-to-5. Decliners topped advancers on the Nasdaq by 7-to-5.


The enterprise, database and desktop software groups led the way.


Software Stocks Surge
---------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP082620-242x300.jpg)The database software group jumped 4.6%, helped by strong showings from **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Elastic** ([ESTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESTC)). Splunk touched a new high during the regular session, but shares slipped 3% in after-hours trading after it reported earnings. Elastic also reported earnings. its shares were flat in extended trading.


The desktop software group surged 6%, led by [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)). Shares climbed to an all-time high, rising 9%.


The enterprise software group rose 5.4%. Salesforce surged 26%, an incredible move considering the stock has a huge float of more than 850 million shares. It's not a heavily shorted stock either, so Wednesday's move was more about fresh institutional buying than anything else.


**Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) was another big gainer in the group. It broke out powerfully from an irregular [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), rising 10%.


**Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), a laggard in the group headed into Wednesday, surged 10%. The stock cleared a base with a 200.10 buy point. Earnings are due Thursday after the close.


Top-rated enterprise software stocks getting support at their [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) include **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)).


**Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) surged above its 10-week line as it approaches a 44.75 buy point.


Stock Market Sentiment
----------------------


The stock market got another yellow flag Wednesday when the latest survey of stock market newsletter writer sentiment was released by Investors Intelligence. The bulls rose to 60% from 59.2% the prior week. The new reading is just above the mid-January reading of 59.4% and the highest since a September 2018 reading of 61.8%, which came just before a sharp market pullback.


According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% call for defensive measures, including tighter stops and trimming some winners. Bulls at 60% or higher call for even more caution.


Headed into Wednesday, both Nasdaq indexes were near the top of an upper channel line and also about 8% above their 50-day moving averages. Both indexes were 8% above their 50-day lines two times in July before sharp, quick pullbacks. Each time though, it didn't take long for each index to find its footing.


If it feels like the stock market is getting easy, you're not alone. That, in and of itself, is reason to be cautious. In many cases, taking some partial profits in nice winners probably makes sense. But giving your A+ stocks more room to work is also a sound strategy, especially with so many leaders above key support levels.


It was another bullish session for tech stocks ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell early Thursday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. The speech starts around 9 a.m. ET, and Powell is expected to provide more details about possible asset purchases to support the economy going forward. Kansas City Fed President Esther George on Wednesday said she sees a rising risk of a double-dip recession for the economy.


Top Gainers
-----------


In the electric-car space, **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) followed through after a breakout Tuesday over a 15.55 buy point. Shares jumped another 14.6% Wednesday. The quick 20% gain from the buy point triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/), although the rule is best used with truly institutional-quality stocks. Nio isn't profitable yet and is on the more speculative side.


New issue **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)), meanwhile, topped an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 20 buy point, but its chart looks a lot different than Nio's. Li Auto's four-session gain of 58.5% came straight up off the bottom, while Nio paused and formed a handle. Nio's handle served to shake out sellers ahead of the breakout.


In related news, IPO **Xpeng Motors** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) is set to price tonight and debut Thursday. The Alibaba-backed startup is another Tesla rival in China, along with Nio and Li Auto.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) moved nicely off their 10-week lines Wednesday. Both stocks are approaching alternate entries.


In the security software group, **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) is also showing good action at its 10-week line, while group peer **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), Wednesday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/crowdstrike-stock-forges-entry-point-july-quarter-earnings/), is near the top of a consolidation with a 118.68 entry. The pattern also resembles a double bottom with a 116.28 buy point. Okta reports earnings on Thursday. CrowdStrike reports next week.

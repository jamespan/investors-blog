The stock market had nothing going its way Wednesday, with rising Treasury yields, intensified geopolitical risks and earnings reports among an array of setbacks for investors.




Chart action took a bearish turn. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell after their 50-day moving averages proved to be a formidable ceiling.


The Nasdaq slid 1.6% and wiped out all gains from its Oct. 6 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), while the S&P 500 lost 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%. Its conquest of the 200-day moving average was short-lived with a close below that line Wednesday.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the composite. Meanwhile, volume on the New York Stock Exchange edged lower. While the number of distribution days has yet to sound alarm bells, the stock market's behavior is unsettling.


Investor's Business Daily's market outlook of "uptrend under pressure" calls for raising cash. Many stocks that broke out past buy points the last few weeks are retracing those gains. Among them, **Booz Allen Hamilton** ([BAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAH)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) all are falling back toward buy points.


The IBD 50 index tumbled 1.8%. **Modine Manufacturing** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)) was the worst performer, down 11%. The specialist in heating and cooling management systems has [hit the 7% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from its 49.60 buy point and [broke below its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume.


Stock Market Uptrend Wobbles
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP101823-192x300.jpg)The stock market's uptrend from its late-September and early-October lows has been on shaky ground lately. That's why IBD is recommending a light exposure level of 0% to 20%.


The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the major indexes was a lackluster D or E even before indexes started turning lower nearly a week ago.


IBD's tracking shows that 52-week lows remain far above 52-week highs. Some days, the ratio is startling. Last Thursday, for instance, Nasdaq new lows were 196, while new highs came in at just 38.


The number of stocks down in volume Wednesday swamped those that were up by a roughly 8-1 ratio.


Breadth — a soft spot for much of the year — was bearish. Decliners topped advancers by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by 5-to-1 on the NYSE.


Treasury Yields Keeps Rising, Hurting Stocks
--------------------------------------------


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped nearly 6 basis points to 4.90%. That's the highest since July 25, 2007, according to Dow Jones Market Data. A [combination of factors worked to push up yields](https://www.investors.com/research/treasury-yields-keep-surging-whats-going-on/), including inflation expectations, a resilient consumer and government debt.


Further, yields rose even as stock market investors sought safe havens. The price of gold rose for the seventh time in nine sessions, with October-delivery contracts closing at $1,955.30 per ounce.


Meanwhile, Nymex crude oil for November delivery gained $1.66 per barrel, or 1.92%, to $88.32 Wednesday.


A blast at a hospital in Gaza City late Tuesday intensified geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. President Joe Biden visited Israel Wednesday, but a [meeting with Arab leaders was scrapped](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/biden-lands-in-tel-aviv-to-meet-israeli-leaders-on-hamas-war-c662832) after the hospital explosion.


Selling struck several economically sensitive sectors. Industrial Select Sector SPDR ([XLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLI)) and Materials Select Sector SPDR ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) slid more than 2%.


Heavy equipment maker **Terex** ([TEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEX)) gapped down more than 9% below its 200-day moving average in heavy volume. The company announced its chief executive will retire. Terex raised its 2023 profit forecast a few cents to around $7.05 a share but that was [below analyst estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-sp-500-construction-stocks-tumble-on-peak-demand-fears-this-is-trigger/) of $7.16.


That forecast sparked heavy selling in **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) and other cyclicals.


Lithium, Airlines Also Drag Stock Market
----------------------------------------


Elsewhere, analysts at Bank of America [downgraded lithium producers](https://www.investors.com/news/lithium-stocks-alb-sqm-downgraded-on-oversupply-as-ev-race-slows/) **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) and **SQM** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)), saying lithium — the principal mineral in electric-vehicle batteries — will become oversupplied in 2024 and 2025.


The downgrade followed a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday that **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) will delay EV pickup production by a year because of demand concerns.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) slid nearly 5% in regular trading, before it reported earnings after the close. Tesla's [third-quarter results missed estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-slide-37-cybertruck-coming-margins-bottomed/). But the stock rose less than 1% in extended trading.


Also late Wednesday, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rallied more than 12% in after-hours trading. The video streaming company posted [strong quarterly gains in its subscriber numbers](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-jumps-on-q3-subscriber-beat/).


**Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) fell to a 15-month low Wednesday. The bank said its [investment-banking revenue fell sharply](https://www.investors.com/news/ms-stock-dives-after-morgan-stanley-reports-27-percent-drop-in-investment-banking-revenue/) in the third quarter.


**United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) sold off nearly 10% to the lowest in one year. The carrier beat third-quarter estimates but gave an outlook pressured by the Israel-Hamas war as well as [higher fuel and other costs](https://www.investors.com/news/united-airlines-earnings-q3-2023-ual-stock-sinks-israel-weighs-outlook/).


IBD's airline industry group fell 3.8% on the stock market, extending a ghastly downslope from its July peak. It was one of Wednesday's worst-performing groups.

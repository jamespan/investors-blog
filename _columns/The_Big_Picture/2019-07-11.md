Blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones led the stock market Thursday as the Street dealt with several pieces of news.




The Dow Jones rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1%. Large caps as gauged in the S&P 500 added 0.2%. Volume in [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) eased on the Nasdaq and was higher on the NYSE.


Small caps lagged considerably and continue to be the sore spot in the market's uptrend. The Russell 2000 fell 0.5%, trading about 10% below its prior high.


News Thursday was on the low-impact side for the stock market.

"The U.S. economy is in a very good place and we want to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said, echoing remarks he made Wednesday to a House panel.


Trump And Health Care
---------------------


In other news, President Trump announced he was [dropping plans to eliminate drug rebates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pharmaceutical-companies-dive-trump-kills-proposal-drug-price-rebates/), which created some losers and winners in the medical sector.


Managed care providers **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) rose 9% and 5%, respectively. Drugmakers **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) dropped 4% and 2%, respectively. Hospital real estate investment trust **Medical Properties** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)) slid 1%.


Brazil Pension Overhaul
-----------------------


On the international front, Brazil's Congress approved a pension overhaul. At one time BRIC stocks — Brazil, Russia, India and China — were hot items. But Brazil in particular hasn't done much in recent years.


Brazil's Bovespa shaped a bear market from February 2018 to June 2018, dropping 20%. But a rebound followed quickly. The Bovespa climbed 51% from the June 2018 low to a recent all-time high.

China And The U.S. Stock Market
-------------------------------


The quiet news Thursday belonged to China. The [Washington Post reported that China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-team-fears-new-face-on-china-trade-team-signals-tougher-stance/2019/07/10/5b6c24d2-a349-11e9-b732-41a79c2551bf_story.html?utm_term=.243202f2f233) has reshuffled its trade negotiating team in a hard-line direction. In the meantime, President Trump complained Thursday that China was not buying U.S. agricultural products.


Meanwhile, breakouts and good follow-up action after breakouts continued. Business software developer **Pegasystems** ([PEGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEGA)) cleared a 76.59 buy point, but volume was only slightly above normal.


Goldman Sachs Breaks Out
------------------------


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) broke past a 210.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in volume 60% above average.

Goldman's stock has a 30% prior uptrend from a December low, a necessary condition for a sound stock. Fundamentals are a bit soft, The Earnings Per Share Rating is 47, roughly middle of the pack among all the stocks in IBD's database.


Stock showing favorable follow-up action after recent breakouts include textbook provider **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), Brazil utility **Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras** ([EBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBR)), **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) and pipeline play **Enterprise Products** ([EPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPD)).


One stock that got clobbered was **Omnicell** ([OMCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OMCL)). The stock fell 13% after short seller GlassHouse Research accused Omnicell of accounting "gimmicks" that distort revenue.

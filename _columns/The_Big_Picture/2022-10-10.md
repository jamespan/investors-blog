Nasdaq Sinks To New Bear-Market Low; These Are The Stock Market Risk Factors To Watch
======================================================================================

Another piece of hope for stock market investors evaporated Monday, when the Nasdaq composite made new lows for its correction.




And now comes the start of earnings season and an inflation report that could heighten investor apprehension. Get your safety goggles on.


First, let's take a look at the Nasdaq's latest signal. The composite fell 1% and undercut its Sept. 30 low. Technically, that kills a rally attempt that started the following day. The Nasdaq also fell below the June low, which had been the bear market's nadir. The Nasdaq is now at the lowest since July 2020.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to also fall on the NYSE.


The S&P 500 lost 0.7% Monday but so far is holding above its own Sept. 30 low. As long as the index can stay above that level, a chance exists for a [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Yet, the stock market remains on tenterhooks.

U.S. defense stocks responded with a gain of more than 1% as a group. **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) made a new closing high. **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), which makes the HIMARS rocket system Ukraine has used with success against Russian forces, climbed 1.6%.


Key Economic Reports On Deck
----------------------------


Economic reports this week have theÂ potential to spark stock market volatility.


On Thursday morning, the consumer price index for September comes out. [Economists expect](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=541685&cust=ibd&year=2022&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) a slight cooling to 8.1% from 8.3% the previous month, and an increase of 0.2% on a month-to-month basis. Also later this week, the producer price index, jobless claims and the minutes of the last Fed meeting are due out.


Several major banks and a handful of other companies will announce third-quarter results in this first busy week of earnings season. Inflation is expected to be a key theme of company reports, as rising costs eat into profits.


Third-quarter S&P 500 net profit margin is expected to contract to 12.2% from 12.9% in Q3 of 2021, according to FactSet. The biggest margin contractions are seen in the materials, consumer staples and health care sectors.


Late last month, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) sold off after the company said higher logistic costs, markdowns and unfavorable currency exchange rates [hurt its gross margin](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-earnings-first-quarter-2023/).


Q3 Earnings Season On Watch For Stock Market
--------------------------------------------


Despite a small sample size of quarterly earnings reports already published, a few themes are emerging.


Companies are citing labor costs and supply-chain disruptions as issues on their earnings, revenues or profit margins in Q3 or future quarters, says John Butters, FactSet senior earnings analyst.


Unfavorable foreign-exchange rates are another worry. Although relatively few, the number of companies mentioning forex problems is running well above the average of past quarters. So far, at least 50% of companies have cited currency headwinds.


The dollar has been rallying on rising Treasury yields and other factors. That makes exports relatively more expensive, and something that hurts multinationals more.



"The strength of the dollar is making it a sharper double-edged sword," said Kevin Gordon, senior investment research manager at Charles Schwab. "On the one hand, we can take comfort in its rise as it signals confidence in the U.S. as a haven, the Fed's credibility staying intact, and a relative hedge against inflation. However, the costs are starting to outweigh the benefits for both the U.S. and broader global economy."


Corporate earnings are increasingly under pressure from the dollar's rise, he added. Also, capital flows to the U.S. are likely to pressure foreign markets.


Tech, Energy Sectors Are Weakest
--------------------------------


Technology and energy sectors led Monday's stock market selling. Chip stocks caused much of the pain in the tech sector as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index sold off 3.5%. The Biden administration on Friday imposed new [restrictions on chip exports to China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-goes-full-court-press-on-chinas-chip-sector-11665403410?mod=article_inline).


The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) slid 3.3% to the lowest level in nearly two years.


These days, buy ideas may not be worth much given the market risk. But a couple of stocks topped buy areas Monday.


Oil and gas explorer **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)) jumped past the 94.05 buy point of a cup base and is already extended from the buy zone. The energy sector remains a bright spot for the stock market.


**PGT Innovations** ([PGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGTI)) climbed above a 23.46 buy point off a cup base in heavy volume. The company's brands include windows that can better withstand heavy storms.


Remember, it is extra risky to buy stocks in a stock market correction.

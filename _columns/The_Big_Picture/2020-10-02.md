title: Dow Jones Rallies Off Lows, But Technology Stocks Take Heat; LGI Homes Tops New Buy Point

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower Friday but closed nicely off lows, undeterred by a weaker-than-expected [September jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-september-2020-dow-jones-coronavirus-recovery/) and news that President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19 with "mild" symptoms.




But it was a different story for the Nasdaq composite on the 10th day of its rally attempt. The index slumped 2.2% as semiconductor stocks and several software groups underperformed. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell from Thursday's levels.


The Nasdaq 100 fared even worse, down 2.8%, hurt by weakness in leading technology stocks like **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Meanwhile, after brief stays above their 50-day moving averages, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) closed slightly below the line Friday.

The enterprise software group held up relatively well, down just 0.8%, helped by strong showings from **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)). The group ended with a weekly gain of around 4.5%. Group leader **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) is now forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 298.86 buy point. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) was on pace to complete a flat base, but it touched a new high Friday.


Dow Jones: Leading Index
------------------------


The Dow Jones eased 0.5% and scored a victory of sorts by closing above the low of Wednesday's follow-through. A close below Wednesday's low would've put the uptrend under pressure again. Technically, the rally is intact as long as the Dow Jones holds above its Sept. 24 low. A break of the Sept. 24 low would put the market back in a correction.


There were some positives to Friday's session, but a weak close for the indexes was a reminder to investors that the risk level remains elevated — even with the market in a confirmed uptrend. The Dow's follow-through day on Wednesday seemed a bit begrudging. It certainly did not convey strength and power.


The S&P 500 also closed off lows, but it still fell 1% on the seventh day of its rally attempt. It ended the week below its 50-day line. The Russell 2000 small-cap index was the star of the day, up 0.5%. It closed just above its 50-day line after nine straight closes below the line. Strength in **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)), **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) and **Ontrak** ([OTRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTRK)) buoyed the S&P 500.



Solid performances from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) — as well as strong showings from railroad stocks and airline stocks — helped fuel iShares Transportation Average ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) to a gain of 0.7%. The exchange-traded fund showed a bullish outside day Friday, reversing higher off its 50-day line in strong volume.

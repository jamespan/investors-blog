Major indexes didn't do much of anything Monday, but it was a far different story in the oil market as Wall Street had plenty of headlines to digest.


At the close, the Dow eased 0.1% while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell fractionally. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Volume fell sharply from Friday's levels.


The IBD 50 added 0.2%, buoyed by strength in **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)), **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)). Stamps.com has a top-notch Composite Rating of 98, partly due to big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Earnings are due Thursday after the close as the stock approaches a 100.42 buy point.


![mp103116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP103116.png)Utilities, miners and steel producers outperformed. Oil and gas names lagged ahead of a busy week of earnings in the sector.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures slumped $1.84, or 3.8%, to $46.86 a barrel, marking the lowest close since late September as hopes for an output cut dimmed. Over the weekend, some major oil producers and OPEC failed to agree on specific production curbs. That raised doubts about whether a deal will take place in late November as planned.


Meanwhile, **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) eased 0.4% on news it's merging its own oil and gas business with oilfield services provider **Baker Hughes** ([BHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHI)) for around $32 billion. After rising 5% early, shares of Baker Hughes slumped 6%. The company will still be called Baker Hughes, but GE will own 62.5% of it. **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) tried to acquire Baker Hughes earlier in the year but abandoned the bid after regulators opposed it.


Several oil and gas producers are set to report earnings this week, including **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) Tuesday after the close. It's been falling in light volume ahead of the results, but Pioneer is now 6% below a prior 191.04 buy point. Group peers **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) report Wednesday, while **Apache** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) report Thursday.


A two-day Fed meeting gets underway Tuesday, but nothing significant is expected to come out of the meeting with the election right around the corner. Odds are still pretty good for a rate hike at the December meeting, however. Late Monday, futures traders saw a 73% probability of a rate hike in December.


When it comes to overall market health, the risk level is elevated.


Just when the [distribution-day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) count started to get more palatable as days dropped off, the count is back up to seven for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The Nasdaq had three in a row in the latest week, on Oct. 25, 26 and 27.


This, in and of itself, makes for a difficult environment to make money in growth stocks. A high distribution-day count is an indication of heightened institutional selling in the market. For this reason, it does not make sense to have aggressive exposure to growth stocks. If a new buy works, great, but don't be afraid to take a profit if the gain hits 10%.


With expectations high, growth stocks generally haven't been responding well to earnings. A solid report last week from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) failed to spur meaningful buying demand. Shares rose nearly 3% early but ended with a gain of just 0.3% Friday. Weakness in the major indexes late in the session didn't help matters, but it was still disappointing price action for Alphabet.


Big sellers were in **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) last week as shares slumped 5% for the week. It rebounded in heavy volume Monday, rising nearly 2%, but it's still below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). A period of base building would help the stock's cause at this point. The stock was extended headed into earnings after a breakout in mid-April and several visits to the 10-week moving average.


Shares of security software name **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) still look good after its earnings-inspired gap up last week. Shares rose an additional 4.5% Monday in heavy volume. It's still vying for a breakout over an 80.77 buy point.

Stocks Slapped Down After Rally Attempt
========================================

Stocks tried to rally from a weak open Thursday, but the bears eventually took control.


The Nasdaq lost 0.5% after being up 0.3%. The S&P 500 trimmed 0.2%. The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.7%, pointing to a defensive bias. The IBD 50 lost 0.4%.


Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq.


The session showed divergence. Winners led losers by a 9-8 ratio on the NYSE, thanks to strength in energy stocks. Losers led by a 5-3 ratio on the Nasdaq.


Perhaps the most interesting development was on the Nasdaq. The index brushed just above its 100-day line. The Nasdaq did that in April, June and February, and each time that marked the low.


Last year, moderate advances followed brief pullbacks, time after time. However, there's no guarantee the 2013 pattern will continue. If the correction is longer and deeper, investors don't want to be caught with too much exposure.


Individual investors should avoid buys. Look for chances to raise cash and then stay in cash until the market sorts itself out.


Although the market's condition is the chief reality, it might help to review other market gauges. For now, they are mixed:


• **Put-call ratio**: Closed at 0.94 Wednesday but ended at 0.82 Thursday. The 1.1 level is considered bullish.


• **Bulls vs. bears**: Investors Intelligence's spread between bulls and bears soared to 46.4 in January, far above the 40 level that can accompany a correction. Such levels of extreme bullishness can precede a sell-off by three months or more. The spread now stands at 37.2.


• **The IBD Mutual Fund Index**: The index has rolled over, a disturbing sign.


• **The NYSE advance-decline line**: The line has a neutral sideways slant.


• **New highs vs. new lows**: It's been about three weeks since combined new highs (Nasdaq plus NYSE) passed 400. One development, though, points to sector rotation. The medical sector lost the leadership role about 10 days ago. Banks, chips and energy are delivering the most new highs now.


• **The NYSE short interest ratio**: The ratio is up about 12% from the levels of four weeks ago. The sharp rise would suggest the shorts are playing a role in this pullback. If institutional investors decide to start buying again, short covering could give the rebound extra juice.


Breakouts are scarce, but have been occurring in finance, chips and energy. Oil patch breakouts include **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)).


Economic news was mixed: slight misses on Q4 GDP and February pending home sales and beats on jobless claims and the Kansas City Fed's factory index.

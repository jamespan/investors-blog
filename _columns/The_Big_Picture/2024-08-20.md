  Stock Market Pauses After Impressive Run; Watch For New Setups But Avoid This Pitfall

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 stepped back in orderly fashion in the stock market Tuesday after eight up sessions in a row.




For stock market bulls, it was another encouraging session after follow-through days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 early last week. The Nasdaq traded in a tight range and barely budged from Monday's close, down just 0.3%.


A distribution day was taking shape on the Nasdaq composite in the morning when the index was down nearly 0.7% in higher volume. But the tech-heavy index pared losses and volume came in lower than at Monday's levels.


On the Nasdaq exchange, declining stocks beat advancers by nearly 2-to-1.


Lower-volume declines and higher-volume gains in the indexes from here would be ideal price action for the bulls. But if higher-volume declines, or distribution days, start to cluster, that would be a sign to get defensive. For now, the nascent uptrend looks solid.


Stock Market: Chip Stocks Lag
-----------------------------


Several chip stocks lagged in the Nasdaq 100, including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) as well as chip-equipment stocks like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)).


But the weakness was offset by a strong performance for **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)). Late Monday, Palo Alto reported another quarter of [slowing earnings and revenue growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-stock-palo-alto-earnings-news-q4-2024/), but investors focused on the company's outlook and strong annual recurring revenue from cloud computing products, which jumped 43% to $4.22 billion.


It was a solid performance for the Nasdaq index even as the VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) exchange traded fund shed 1.3%. After a bounce off the 200-day moving average, the ETF's 50-day moving average is still a potential resistance level to watch.

Further, Palo Alto's strong breakout helped fuel IBD's security software group to a gain of around 2%. **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) tried to break out of a consolidation again, but a 2.9% intraday gain faded to a loss of 0.3% by the close.


The stock showed similar price action on July 16 after an initial breakout attempt. Even though CyberArk topped a buy point early Tuesday, it was a risky buy after a strong move over a short period of time.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP082024.jpg)Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) also topped a buy point Tuesday after the company cited strong ad sales trends. But the stock needs a breather after 10 gains in 11 trading sessions.


As always, be careful not to chase extended stocks. Instead, focus on the true stock market leaders that are pulling back in light volume and finding support at key levels.


Eli Lilly Leads S&P 500
-----------------------


The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in lower volume. But **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) was a top gainer in the index, up around 3%.


The drug giant said a three-year study of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Lilly's weight-loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro —  lowered obese and overweight patients' risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 94%. Eli Lilly is a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock after rejoining the list last week.


Meanwhile, breadth was nearly 2-to-1 negative on the New York Stock Exchange.


After gapping above its 50-day moving average last week, the Russell 2000 lagged with a loss of 1.2%. But the small-cap index is still holding above all of its moving averages.


Oil and gas stocks were among the worst performers amid a modest decline in the price of oil. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled at $73.82 a barrel, down 0.7%.


Stock Market: Dow Snaps Win Streak
----------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-session win streak with a decline of nearly 0.2%.


**Matson** ([MATX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MATX)) and **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) were a drag on shipping stocks, with the group down 2.5%. But **Navios Maritime Partners** ([NMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMM)) was a bright spot, soaring 16% after reporting earnings.


Navios gapped out of a short consolidation with a conventional entry of 53.83. But just like CyberArk and Netflix, the stock has run up quickly in a short amount of time.



**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) continues to trade tightly near highs with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) also near highs. The stock remains a breakout candidate after a breakout attempt on July 5 soured quickly.


Bond Yields Slip As Interest Ruling Nears
-----------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 3.81% just after the stock market close, down five basis points, as investors prepare for an expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the September meeting.


The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)), basically a long dollar fund, fell sharply for the third straight session. The fund  hit its lowest level since March.


Traders think there's a 68% chance that the federal funds rate will be at 4.25% to 4.5% by year's end. At its current level of 5.25% to 5.5%, that implies 100 basis points of cuts at the next three meetings.


But Ed Yardeni from Yardeni Research isn't so sure. In a CNBC interview Monday, Yardeni called for a "one and done" rate cut in September as inflation continues to moderate despite a strong jobs market.


Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to give a key speech on monetary policy Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium Friday at 10 a.m. ET. Before that, the minutes from the late-July Fed meeting will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

The message from Wall Street: We're not complacent any more.


The stock market on Wednesday showed its disapproval at the latest media reports surrounding the saga regarding the White House's shock firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Disapproval, because concern has clearly risen about the ability of President Trump and Congress to make bold moves to re-energize the American economy.


The major indexes suffered their biggest one-day losses since early September or earlier. Oil and gold shot up. Some hot money fled into bonds, sending the yield on the 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury yield sinking 16 basis points to 2.22%, its lowest level since mid-April.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP_4x3_051717-168x300.png)The Nasdaq, the leading index so far in 2017, clearly had more to lose on Wednesday. The tech-filled composite index dropped 2.6%, its worst day since plunging 4.1% on June 24. A summary sell-off of community banks also took their toll on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 sank 1.8%, notching its biggest decline since a 2.45% slide on Sept. 9.


Volume ran sharply higher on both main exchanges, handing the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fresh distribution days. A sudden rush of severe distribution days can end a market run.


After that Sept. 9 decline, the market moved like a clipper ship in rough seas, bobbing up and down until Trump's surprise election win on Nov. 8 unleashed the bulls. Are those choppy waters back?


The possibility has risen enough to warrant a change in IBD's current outlook for the market to "uptrend under pressure." This means new buys should be made cautiously. Breakouts are less likely to succeed. So raising some cash can shield your portfolio from further serious declines as well.


On April 24, IBD switched the outlook to "uptrend resumes" as the Nasdaq speared a new high. But after Wednesday's massacre, the gains since that April 24 session's close are now less than 0.5%.


Furthermore, the S&P 500 sliced through its 50-day moving average Wednesday in a way that was more bearish in character from the last two times it happened.


Notice on a daily chart how the S&P had briefly slipped beneath the intermediate-support line on March 27, but finished the day above it with a measly 0.1% decline. Volume on the NYSE grew but was well below average. Nearly three weeks later, the S&P 500 spent some time below the 50-day line again, but heavy volume was absent.


Ditto for the recent action by the Dow Jones industrials, down 1.8% on Wednesday.


Volume accelerated in the final half-hour on both exchanges and ended higher, according to preliminary data, resulting in a fresh day of unequivocal institutional selling for the Nasdaq composite. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume higher. As seen in the Market Pulse table, the distribution-day count rises back to an elevated level of four for the S&P 500 and stays at three for the Nasdaq because the April 11 distribution expired on time.


Small caps fell hard too. The S&P 600, down 2.6% on Wednesday, is now more than 5% below its all-time peak of 866.81.


Concerns were felt in overseas equity markets as well. Germany's DAX 100 suffered its worst single-day decline since Jan. 1, falling more than 1.3%. Back in the U.S., fear gauges went up. The CBOE Market Volatility index, or the VIX, hit a three-week high and reached as high as 14.59. That's still well below the Nov. 4 spike up to 23.01.


Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence weekly survey showed that bullishness among newsletter pundits has fallen a bit but is still unusually high. The bullish ratio had risen to 63.1% on March 3.


While corporate earnings have been pleasantly surprising in the recent quarter, the market will be on the lookout for new signs that Congress will work together. The current market rally may just depend on it. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that Senate Republican leaders showed signs of working with Senate Democrats on creating a new bill to reform tax rates. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with bipartisan members of the Senate Finance Committee.


Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., later described the meeting as "just an opener," but during a speech on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hinted that he may soften his stance on driving through a new tax plan without the involvement of his Democratic colleagues, AP said. Republicans have a thin majority in the Senate at 52-48.


As an individual investor, it's time to be more mindful of key sell signals that may pop up among the stocks in your portfolio. Did they just suffer their biggest single-session point drop since their breakout from a base? Was volume unusually heavy? And are they sinking fast below their 50-day or 10-week moving averages in heavy turnover?


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) is doing what many fellow banking stocks have done lately. It had a clean breakout past an good cup-with-handle buy point of 65.08 on Aug. 5, and gains have been magnificent. But lately, the stock has been hit by repeated upside resistance at the 50-day moving average.
Wednesday's 3.34-point drop to 84.27 in strong turnover was JPMorgan's biggest decline since the start of the move.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) also suffered its biggest single-day point drop since Jan. 6-9 breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The largest company in the U.S. financial markets dropped 5.27 to 150.20 as volume soared 90% above average.


For now, the iPhone and iPad giant still enjoys a big air cushion above its fast-rising 50-day and 10-week lines. Strong buying support at those moving averages would be a bullish sign for Apple's long-term trend, though.
Also watch for potential round-trips in recent breakouts by other leaders. You never want a decent gain of 10% or more to cycle into a loss. A savvy investor knows he or she can always buy the same stock back, no questions asked.

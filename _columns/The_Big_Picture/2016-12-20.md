The stock market Tuesday made moderate gains that kept it in a tight, constructive pattern from where it is surveying new highs.


In a day of mostly minor movements, the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average added 0.5% as both made new highs. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.


![mp122016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122016-184x300.png)The blue-chip Dow got tantalizingly close to the 20,000 level. While it's a psychological milestone that looms for the industrials, chart readers need to stay alert. If anything, big round numbers may cause big investors to sell into the hands of novices seduced by the bullish headlines.


While the Dow 30 generated buzz, small caps had a fine day of their own Tuesday. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.9%. It's always encouraging to find the smaller, more speculative stocks performing well, and the Russell is nearing new highs too.


The Dow transports climbed 0.8% thanks largely to strength in airline and shipping stocks. The retail, steel and metal industry groups led the market Tuesday. Energy issues and some medical stocks such as ethical drugs lagged.


Quiet trading should continue through the holiday season, which makes it hard to read market signals. But this much can be said: Indexes are acting normally for an uptrend.


The Nov. 14 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) on the Nasdaq was deleted because it's now too far back in time. The number of higher-volume declines remains lopsided, with twice as many on the Nasdaq as in the S&P 500. But only a few distribution days since the November lows have had the oppressive losses and volume that truly distinguish institutional selling.


The advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE have reached new highs this month, illustrating the broad participation of sectors in the bull run.Â There was favorable breadth Tuesday, with winners topping losers by 9-to-5 on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Only the sheer size of the market's postelection rally poses a threat. Any advance as strong as the one of the past six weeks needs to pause, and the indexes have had only a couple of short rests.


Investors who bought early in the election rally have some winners to toast for the holidays. But since then, few leading stocks have formed follow-on buy areas and few are forming bases. Investors trying to increase their exposure will need to be patient and look through multiple screens to find new opportunities.


In the IBD 50, brokerage **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) is tracing a tight pattern with a 40.06 buy point, and on Tuesday it poked just above that follow-on entry. **Microchip** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) is rising from support at the 10-week moving average.


Consumer leaders **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) and **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) are forming new bases.

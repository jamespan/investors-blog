U.S. stock indexes kept to their recent nonchalant action Friday, as the market put the final touches on a strong year.


The Nasdaq slipped 0.7% Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.5% each. The small cap Russell 2000 lost 0.5%.




 Volume in the stock market was up on easy comparisons, slapping a distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


For the year, the Nasdaq rose 28%, the Dow 25% and the S&P 500 19% — the best gains in four years. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an exchange traded fund based on the IBD 50, surged 37%.


Here are seven things investors need to ponder in 2018.


**Can 2018 repeat?** After a big annual gain, bulls might be thinking the key word is momentum, while bears are thinking exhaustion is more likely.


If an investor looks at history, the answer depends a great deal on how the comparison is framed. For example, since 1963, the S&P 500 rose at least 15% in 19 different years. Only once (1996-97) did the next year provide a bigger percentage gain.

In 13 instances, the next year was positive while in five years, the next year was negative.


So, if the investor's question is "Should an investor play this market?" then the answer is yes. But the investor should be ready with sound sell rules, both to cut losses and take profits.


**Tip:** Watch to see how the market reacts in January to beats and misses when Q4 results start rolling in.


**Where is the strength?** This will be a key thing to grasp as soon as possible in 2018. The No. 1 industry group in 2017 was homebuilders, up 100%, according to preliminary data. Within the group, the biggest percentage gainer was **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), up 161%.


For those scanning for more recent strength, investment banking has led over the past four weeks, up 29%. Metal ore miners followed with a 15% gain.


**Tip:** Sectors with [the most new highs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) is one way to detect rotation.


**What could kill this bull market?** Bull markets do not die of old age. Generally, a recession is the chief culprit. The last recession began in December 2007, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The S&P 500 flagged the trouble several months in advance. This is normal, and it's another reason individual investors should learn [how to interpret charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/loose-trade-price-spikes-say-sell/).


While a market bottom forms quickly, a market top can take months to form. The S&P 500 began having trouble in July 2007 and confirmed the difficulties in mid-October 2007.


War also can kill a bull market. World War II led to a 20% correction in the Dow Jones industrial average from the Pearl Harbor attack to about five months later.


The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks came on a Tuesday, and the stock market did not reopen until the following Monday. From there, the S&P 500 dropped 13% over five sessions. A rebound of sorts followed, but eventually the index fell 30% before finding a true bottom.


**Tip:** Watch the yield curve. When [the 2-year yield rises above the 10-year yield](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us), it often heralds a recession.


**Confidence matters:** If confidence and clarity are missing, businesses don't increase capital spending, and consumers don't spend money. Since President Trump's election, clarity and confidence have increased on economic matters. The landscape is less clear on foreign policy.


Meanwhile, Investors Intelligence's [bulls vs. bears gauge](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears), a secondary indicator, is flashing warning signs. Bullishness is the highest in 30 years, suggesting the next move is likely down.


**Tip:** Watch the IBD/TIPP [Economic Optimism Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ibdtipp-poll-economic-optimism-index/). It can spot psychological changes.


**Deregulation is still iffy:** President Trump points to his executive order 13771, which requires that "for every new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination." While that sounds aggressive, Dodd-Frank and the Basel rules are the major items, and no one has set fire to them yet.  The Republican response so far to the big items has been to tinker rather than eliminate. A full repeal of Dodd-Frank would be a clearer signal to the market, but that doesn't look likely.


A bill comprised of changes to the Dodd-Frank law cleared the Senate Banking Committee in a 16-7 vote Dec. 5.


**Tip:** Watch the bank stocks if the bill becomes law. They should get a boost.


**The Fed Is Fading:** For years, the Federal Reserve ran a massive stimulus effort, and the Fed's ability to set the tone on Wall Street mattered greatly to the stock market. Not so much now as interest rates rise. The increase in rates might be more of a return to normalcy than a tightening. Clarity is exceptional, and so the market has one less thing to worry about.


Growth in the money supply picked up in 2016, and monetarists say that portends faster economic growth.


**Tip:** The best way to [gauge the money supply](http://centerforfinancialstability.org/) is the Center for Financial Stability's Divisia M4 including Treasuries data.


**The Great Melt Up:**  Some markets end with a fast run-up and a bang. An investor might not see this as much in the indexes as in the leading stocks. From mid-August 2007 to mid-October, the S&P 500 rose 15%. But the market leaders were soaring.


Should that happen in 2018, the individual investor will want to play the run-up intelligently. The chart will tell the investor when to sell a stock, but the investor needs to understand how a climax run proceeds.


Individual investors might want to brush up on their understanding of climax tops. See pages 263 and 264 in the fourth edition of William J. O'Neil's ["How to Make Money in Stocks."](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Money-Stocks-Winning/dp/0071614133/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1514506741&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+make+money+in+stocks+william+o%27neil) Study the related charts.


Consider reading those two pages on a weekly or monthly basis. Should the great run come, being prepared will help protect most of the gains.

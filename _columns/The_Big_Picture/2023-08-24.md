The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 373 points Thursday, as the major stock indexes reversed from early gains to finish sharply lower. Next up on Friday, investors will shift their attention to [Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech](https://www.investors.com/news/federal-reserve-chair-powell-at-jackson-hole-heres-the-real-risk-for-the-sp-500/) from Jackson Hole, Wyo.




As the stock market's rally attempt continues, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)), **Baker Hughes** ([BKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKR)) and **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) are holding up well, as illustrated by strong relative strength lines.


U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher Thursday, with the 10-year yield settling at 4.23%.


On Thursday, key earnings movers included **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — along with **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)).


[Autodesk](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adsk-stock-autodesk-beats-quarterly-goals-guides-higher/) shares cut gains to 2.1%, closing just above their 50-day line. Dollar Tree dived nearly 13% after delivering earnings, and NetApp declined more than 1%. Snowflake slid more than 5%, while Splunk leapt nearly 13% to break out past a 112.03 flat-base entry.


Finally, [Nvidia smashed Wall Street's lofty expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvda-stock-nvidia-smashes-quarterly-targets-again/) for its fiscal second quarter and guided higher than views for the current period. NVDA stock slashed gains to just 0.1% after gapping up to record highs at the opening bell.


Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Hits Resistance
---------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1%, while the S&P 500 moved down nearly 1.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off 1.9%. In a concerning move, all three found stout resistance at their 50-day moving averages, closing at session lows Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP082423-285x300.jpg)In the Dow 30, aerospace giant **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) tumbled nearly 5% after the [company discovered a defect](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-stalls-spirit-aerosystems-pokes-more-holes-in-737-delivery-schedule/) that may delay deliveries of its 737 Max jet, Bloomberg reported late Wednesday. Supplier **Spirit AeroSystems** ([SPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPR)), once again the apparent source of the problem, retreated more than 12%. Boeing shares gave up their 223.91 buy point and their 50-day line in big volume.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE vs. the prior session.


Top growth stocks also finished lower, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) stumbled 1.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) slid 4.6% in heavy volume. Shares closed sharply below their 50-day line, a sell signal ahead of next week's earnings report.


With Thursday's bearish action, IBD's market outlook remains with the stock market in correction, while the recommended exposure range was reduced to 0%-20%. It had been at 20%-40%. It seems unlikely after Thursday's brutal downside reversal, but a follow-through day is still possible any day. And as long as the Nasdaq remains above its Aug. 18 lows, the rally attempt remains intact.


But until that occurs, investors should be in preservation mode with their capital. Taking some profits is a smart option. They should be building watchlists of top stocks near buy points to act on once the market status shifts.

Leaders To Watch: Baker Hughes, Nucor, Tidewater
------------------------------------------------



With the market in a correction, investors should hold off on new purchases until a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) signals the start of a potential new uptrend. But these stocks have strong RS lines and are worth watching due to their outperformance vs. the S&P 500 in recent weeks:


[Drilling and energy company](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/baker-hughes-eyes-entry-as-oil-prices-fuel-energy-gains/) Baker Hughes has been [trading tightly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) the past five weeks and has [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at its 2023 high of 36.48, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


[Recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nue-stock-builds-toward-buy-point-as-government-splurges/) Nucor is testing support around its 50-day line, with a 1.2% drop Thursday. A move past 174.73, the high point of the three-weeks-tight pattern, would provide an entry opportunity. The three-weeks-tight formation also can be seen as a handle, offering the same 174.73 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Finally, on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), Tidewater joined as a half size position Wednesday as it rebounds from its 10-week moving average. The RS line hit a new high in early August.

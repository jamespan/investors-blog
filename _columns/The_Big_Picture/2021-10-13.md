In a positive change from the past few days, the stock market picked itself off session lows and closed at Wednesday's highs.




The S&P 500 reversed higher, while the Nasdaq composite held most gains into the close. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq tacked on 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat but worked off a 0.8% drop.


Nasdaq volume was flat and NYSE volume appeared to rise only slightly.


The strong close was a welcome change after a series of days in which the opposite action occurred: Indexes faded into the close. But at the end of the day, there wasn't anything to truly feel more bullish about the market.

While energy, financials and a few other select industries are outperforming, the general market is directionless. With the stock market unsure of its next steps, staying in cash makes sense as a defensive mechanism.


Traditionally, a market correction means the major indexes fall more than 10% from their peaks. But by then, stocks have taken serious hits, which is why IBD prefers to change its outlook well before the market is down so much.


Challenges Of Current Stock Market
----------------------------------


Some examples from the past few weeks illustrate the challenge of the current market.


**AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) and **Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)) have faded from last month's breakouts. **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) looked ready to top on Sept. 28 after climax-like action. Yet it's back near highs and up more than 20% this week.


A nearly yearlong rally since the market made new highs last November surely needed some time to digest itself. And today, the market has a lot on its mind.


At the Federal Reserve's meeting last month, it grew more convinced to start winding down its asset purchases next month and end the program by about the middle of next year. Minutes of the meeting showed some Fed decision makers eager to roll back purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities even faster, according to Dow Jones.


The stock market didn't change much following the 2 p.m. ET release of the Fed minutes, as if it's resigned to see the end of this stimulus program.


Inflation Worries Hit Stock Market
----------------------------------


If the Fed sounds in a hurry to stop its quantitative easing, it's partly because of stubborn inflation. The central bank sounds [worried about rising costs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-signals-asset-purchases-could-end-by-mid-2022-11634148001?mod=hp_lead_pos3).


The [consumer price index rose 0.4% in September](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/core-cpi-inflation-steady-but-its-the-eye-of-the-storm-sp-500-futures-dip/) from the prior month and 5.4% from a year ago. The latter went back up to the June and July levels, which marked the highest inflation since 2008. Economists expected a 0.3% monthly rise and 5.3% year-over-year increase. Excluding volatile food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2% from August, meeting forecasts.


David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a commentary that while wages have strengthened this year, rising consumer prices are eroding Americans' buying power. Inflation-adjusted hourly earnings are down 0.8% from a year ago.


As earnings season starts, "the impact of higher input costs and wages will command investor attention and may pose further downside risks to corporate profits," Kelly said.


Bank Earnings News Doesn't Impress
----------------------------------



The first in a series of important bank earnings came out Wednesday morning, and Wall Street's reaction wasn't jovial.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) [beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-stocks-gain-ahead-of-q3-earnings-reports/) with third-quarter earnings of $3.74 a share. Yet the stock sold off, diving below the 163.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a breakout Sept. 27. Revenue was nearly flat at $30.44 billion. Bank executives said the [delta variant of Covid-19 and rising fuel prices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-profit-jumps-on-reserve-release-11634123662?mod=hp_lead_pos4) slowed spending.


In an early test for the travel industry, **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) beat Q3 expectations. But the stock tumbled. Delta sees more improvement in the coming months, but cautioned that [higher fuel costs are expected to cause a net loss in Q4](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-delta-q321-earnings-american-airlines-guidance/).


The IBD 50 climbed 1.2%, beating the broad indexes thanks to a handful of surging growth plays in the stock market.



**TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) jumped 15% as it found support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-why-the-10-week-line-offers-follow-on-buy-points/). The stock market leader got some airplay in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


New-issue **Dutch Bros.** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) climbed nearly 7% as it forms its [first base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) rose for the 10th straight day.


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) so far is acting bullishly. The stock is at new highs following support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


**Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) Wednesday. But light volume clouded the breakout.

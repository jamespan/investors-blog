Win Streak Ends For Stocks After Trump, Mnuchin Panic The Bulls
================================================================

Stocks on Friday halted a three-day win streak, as deep losses pushed the major indexes into negative territory for the week.




The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each lopped off 2.3% Friday, while the S&P 500 lost 2.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.9%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges but remained routine.


Declining volume characterized the three up days and set up an easy comparison for Friday's session.


Funds appear to be stepping back from this market and for good reason.

The market seems to be seeking direction but keeps getting buffeted by headlines. The news tends to occur overnight, causing sharp moves when Wall Street opens. It's certainly no time for big bets, long or short.


Speculation had been growing that President Trump's tariff threats were a ploy to gain a better deal for the U.S. vis-a-vis China. The market appears to like that idea, and negotiations could yet yield results.


But Thursday night, [Trump expanded his list of tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-trump-100-billion-tariff-threat-good-news/) to slap on Chinese goods.


China didn't respond immediately Friday, instead choosing to enjoy the Qing Ming Jie holiday that honors ancestors with tomb tidying and the flying of kites.


The Shanghai stock exchange was closed for the holiday.


Mnuchin Scares Market
---------------------


Selling in the U.S. stock market was certain after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that the U.S. was not in a trade war but might be soon.

If Mnuchin was trying to reassure markets, he failed miserably. Selling picked up after he appeared on CNBC.


Meanwhile, data for the U.S. stock market improved somewhat in recent sessions.


For instance, new lows had outnumbered new highs for 12 sessions in a row. On Thursday, new highs retook the lead position but lost the advantage Friday, according to preliminary data.


When a stock market is healthy, new highs usually hold a commanding lead. That doesn't happen during a market correction.


On Friday, stocks posting new highs included footwear and apparel provider **Adidas** ([ADDYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADDYY)); Brazilian airline **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)); and restaurant chain **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)).


Payroll figures were disappointing Friday. March nonfarm payrolls rolled in at 103,000, about 40% fewer than expected.


In the coming week, news in focus will include Wednesday's release of the Federal Reserve's minutes from its March meeting.


Despite Friday's selling, the put/call ratio closed at a calm 1.04.

=====================================================================================================

The stock market extended gains Tuesday, helped by another day of outperformance from small-cap and midcap stocks.




Sentiment was positive after the latest reading on consumer prices showed that [headline inflation continues to cool](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-falls-to-4-sp-500-futures-rise-ahead-of-fed-meeting/). Month over month, the Consumer Price Index increased 0.1% in May, below the 0.2% consensus forecast. Year over year, prices were up 4%, a little below the 4.1% consensus, but well below April's reading of 4.9%. But core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, was only in line with expectations. Core prices were up 0.4% month over month and 5.3% year over year.


After the data, the 10-year Treasury yield traded all the way down to 3.68%. But the yield came all the way back and was trading around 3.83%, up 6 basis points, just after the stock market close.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) and the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rose above their highs from last week, ending with gains just over 1%.


The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% and closed at its highest level since April 2022. The S&P 500 added 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.4%. The Dow Jones climbed above its May 1 high before backing off highs by the close. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Monday's levels, resulting in a bullish accumulation day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 isn't nearly as extended as the Nasdaq composite at this point, but it's getting close. It closed 4.9% above its 50-day moving average, near the 5% threshold that has presaged pullbacks for the benchmark index in the past.

When it comes to the Nasdaq, well, the index's longest losing streak since May 5 has been two sessions. The index closed 9% above its 50-day line and crossed an upper channel line, raising the probability for a pullback. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ended 10.1% above its 50-day line. That's above the 6% to 7% threshold that has flagged pullbacks for the Nasdaq 100 in the past.


Two more [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the count Tuesday. For the Nasdaq composite, the May 31 distribution day was dropped because the index rallied 5% from that day's close. For the S&P 500, the May 23 distribution day fell off the count for the same reason.


Advancing stocks beat decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 2-to-1. Winners topped losers on the NYSE by a little over 2-to-1.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting concludes Wednesday, and the Fed is widely expected to hold the fed funds rate steady in a range of 5% to 5.25%. For July, futures traders put the chances of another 25-basis-point hike at 65%.


Sentiment was positive in the technology sector after **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) reported earnings and said its AI customers want to buy more than $2 billion in cloud capacity. Just like the Nasdaq composite, though, ORCL stock looks overbought. The software giant pared a 6.5% intraday gain to just 0.2%.


In the current stock market environment, risk-averse investors might think about trimming some winners. But if your conviction is still high about the fledgling rally, letting your winners run is also sound strategy.


News that China cut a key interest rate fueled nice gains for mining and metals stocks. Copper miner **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) gapped up and rose 5%. But the strong move wasn't enough to break FCX out of its latest downtrend. Freeport's weekly chart shows a potential [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/getting-the-dub-recognizing-the-double-bottom-base-pattern/) in the works with a 43.46 entry.


Market Movers
-------------


Among steel producers, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) ended with gains of 4% and 6%, respectively.

Stock market breadth was narrow when large-cap technology carried the leadership baton. But market leadership has expanded nicely as industrials, building, travel and transportation stocks have joined the rally.


**Parker-Hannifin** ([PH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PH)), a provider of motion and control technologies for mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, cleared a 15-week cup base. **SPX Technologies** ([SPXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPXC)) and **Ingersoll Rand** ([IR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IR)) have also delivered breakouts in the group over the past few weeks.


Meanwhile, IBD's airline group was one of the day's top performers, up nearly 3%. Inside the group, **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) is quickly forming the right side of a cup base. Watch for UAL stock to drift lower and start forming a handle as it approaches its recent high of 55.04. Group peer **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) extended its winning streak to 13 sessions Tuesday, rising another 3.4%.


**W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)) continues to make good progress after clearing a base with a 709.21 entry.


Meanwhile, a couple of stock market leaders fell in heavy volume. After a strong close Monday, **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) fell sharply to its 10-day moving average, but the stock managed to close above the line.


**ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), meanwhile, fell nearly 3% and came close to a test of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

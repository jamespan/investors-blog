Blue chips led another up session on Wall Street Tuesday as the stock market delivered another round of healthy earnings reports. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), meanwhile, dropped a bombshell.




Shares of Tesla were halted around 2 p.m. ET at 367.25, up 7.4%, after CEO Elon Musk tweeted he was considering [taking the company private](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-elon-musk-tweet/) at a valuation of $420 a share. Trading resumed around 3:45 p.m. ET, and the stock closed at 379.57, up 11%. Tesla broke out past the 373.83 buy point of a cup base.


Blue Chips On The Move
----------------------


A handful of blue chips ended with gains of 1% or more, sending the Dow Jones industrial average higher by 0.5%. Shares of **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) extended gains, rising 1.3% to 8.053. It's just below the 81.10 flat-base entry. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) picked up 1%. It's back above the 50-day moving average but below a 103.34 entry. Financials performed well overall as the 10-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 2.97%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP080718-219x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to six sessions, rising 0.3%. After a nice bounce off the 50-day moving average, the index on Tuesday hit a high of 7898, only 35 points from its July 25 high of 7933.


The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index also added 0.3%. The S&P 500 is about 14 points from its all-time high. The Russell 2000 is also near highs, but it's getting resistance near 1700. Volume on the Nasdaq came in slightly lower than Monday. Volume on the NYSE rose a bit, according to preliminary data. Winners had a slight edge over losers on both exchanges.


The market uptrend came under pressure when the Nasdaq paid a visit to its 50-day moving average late last month. But the uptrend resumed after the Nasdaq quickly found its footing.


A market tide flowing positive is generally good news for growth investors, but **Etsy**'s ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) price action Tuesday showed that breakouts can still be challenging. Etsy gapped up powerfully out of a flat base with a 45.98 buy point, but gains were short-lived. After soaring 19% intraday, Etsy ended at 43.84, up 3.3%.


Earnings Reports In Focus
-------------------------


The majority of S&P 500 firms have reported earnings, but Wall Street had plenty of earnings reports to consider from high-growth names.


Enterprise software stock **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) vaulted nearly 19% to 75.10 after the company reported an unexpected profit with adjusted earnings of 3 cents a share. Sales rose 54% to $147.8 million. Twilio's weekly chart shows a breakout from a bottoming base during the week ended March 2.


Group peer **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)) was below its 50-day moving average of its quarterly earnings report, but the stock gapped up powerfully out of a late-stage consolidation, rising 24% to 43.51. The buy point was 39.65.


**RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) also reported solid results, but it was already extended after a breakout from a base in early May.


The enterprise software group looked like it was ready to roll over in late July when it plunged below the 50-day moving average, but the group reclaimed the 50-day line Monday and gapped up Tuesday.


In economic news, the [IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/ibd-tipp-poll-economic-optimism-14-year-high/) for August hit its highest reading since January 2004. It's the first reading on consumer confidence for August. The Personal Finance component hit its second-highest reading ever since the poll started nearly 18 years ago.

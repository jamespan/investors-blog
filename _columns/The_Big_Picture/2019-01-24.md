  Nasdaq Closes Strongly While Starbucks Pops After Hours

Chip stocks did the heavy lifting for the Nasdaq, but the rest of the stock market couldn't come close to keeping pace Thursday with the semiconductor sector. Meanwhile, Starbucks rose after hours on strong results.




The Nasdaq pocketed a 0.7% gain, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1%. Small caps were co-leaders as the Russell 2000 advanced 0.7%.


The day's gains, though, looked puny on closer examination. For instance, the Philadelphia semiconductor index ballooned almost 6% higher Thursday. Chip stocks make up about 13% of the Nasdaq 100 (basically 13 stocks), and the chip stocks provided outstanding gains.


Chip Stocks Lead
----------------


**Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) rocketed 16%; **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)), 18%; and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), 6%. Lam and Xilinx reported [results that topped](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-stock-record-high-earnings/) the Street's consensus estimate on revenue and earnings.

Nine of 10 other chip stocks in the Nasdaq 100 delivered gains of 2% to 6%. **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) was the only loser among the 13, down almost 2%.


Yet, the nice gains in chips found little support elsewhere in the stock market.


If not for the chip stocks, a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) might have been likely.


A distribution day involves a price loss in rising volume. Such action points to institutional selling.


Volume rose on both major exchanges Thursday.


News Hasn't Helped The Market
-----------------------------


After four weeks of gains in the Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow Jones and Russell 2000, the indexes appear poised to chalk up a negative week.


News hasn't been very useful to the bulls.


The government shutdown marked Day 34 on Thursday, and the Democrats and Republicans alike have shown little willingness to compromise.


Meanwhile, the U.S.-China showdown on trade appears likely to persist until March 1. Without an agreement, March 1 is when U.S. tariffs on China goods will increase from 10% to 25%.


One bright spot Thursday was first-time jobless claims. The count came in at 199,000, the lowest level since 1969.


Starbucks Shines
----------------


After the close, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) reported results for the fiscal Q1 ended in December. Starbucks [beat quarterly views](https://www.investors.com/news/starbucks-earnings-q1-2019-starbucks-stock-buy-point/) on earnings, revenue and same-store sales, and it raised guidance. The coffee restaurant company's stock was up 2% in extended trading.


Companies reporting earnings Friday include homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and personal care products provider **Colgate-Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)).

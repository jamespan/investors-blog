The stock market napped for much of the day but awakened with a late rally Monday. The results provided evidence of an emerging trend in the market.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.7% for its sixth advance in the past seven sessions. The S&P 500 was down nearly the entire day until it made it into positive territory in the final 10 minutes of trading. Its 0.2% gain was just enough for another record high.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was off 0.4%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE as well.


In a market that's been subdued for weeks, it may be hard to notice shifting trends, but the Nasdaq quietly is starting to outperform.


![MP061421](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP061421-185x300.jpg)That's a change from earlier in the year. The S&P 500 still leads with a year-to-date gain of 13.2%. But so far in June, the Nasdaq is up 3% while the S&P is up 1.1%, and the composite has narrowed its gap with the S&P 500: It is now up 10% for the year. The turning point appears to be the stock market's mid-May lows. From that point, the Nasdaq has climbed 9% while the S&P 500 is up nearly 5%.


Technology Sector Improving
---------------------------


One reason for the new trend is the performance of technology stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) has made up almost all of a 9% decline from its April peak. Technology is up about 7% from the May low, the second best S&P sector performance after Real Estate, which has rallied more than 10%.


Software, semiconductor and other technology industry groups are bouncing back. It was precisely those groups leading Monday's stock market. Chip equipment and enterprise software climbed about 1.5%; financial, design and other software groups added 1% or more. Computer hardware and peripherals rose 1%. All that weighed heavily in the Nasdaq, which is about 50% stacked with tech stocks.


The Nasdaq was left with just one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) after the May 10 sell-off came off the count. The Nasdaq has climbed more than 5% from the May 10 close of 13,401.86, rendering that distribution day obsolete. The S&P 500 still has five distribution days.


While the stock market looked better in terms of indexes, the same wasn't quite true of specific leading stocks. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tripped up 1.1%, and the Innovator Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) lost 0.4%.


The Stock Market's Challenge
----------------------------


One downside of this year's market is the difficulty finding leaders that will break out and keep extending gains. That's not to say there's a shortage of opportunities. Quite the contrary, plenty of top-rated stocks are [setting up in bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) or [secondary buy areas](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/). Investors should continue to explore those opportunities when they break out.



On Monday, footwear maker **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) rose above a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) and was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). Cloud software leader **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) cleared an eight-week pattern, while industry peer **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) rose past a 56.23 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), albeit in so-so volume. Dynatrace got some air play in [Monday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live-Free-Access&intcode=hpspt%7Ccms%7Cibdlvfr%7C2021%7C05%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C749906&src=JA3813), which kicked off Open Access Week on Monday.


This is a stock market that takes patience; it's not necessarily one to give up on.


The Federal Reserve concludes a policy meeting Wednesday, so expect the stock market to be guarded before the meeting concludes. With investors sensitive about inflation, the Fed's message on its tolerance for rising prices will be the key news.


Financial stocks continued to weaken. Just like they rose on rising interest rates, they've been falling as yields contract. However, on Monday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 4 basis points to 1.5%. Construction stocks also were broadly lower.

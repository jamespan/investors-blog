A tale of two stock markets in 2022? Certainly. But overall, weakness remains broad across Wall Street, and most major indexes are in increasing danger of returning to a correction phase.




At this stage, a healthy wad of cash is an excellent position in the portfolio.


One full trading week earlier on Friday Feb. 11, IBD downgraded the outlook from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure." At the time, the key indexes all but forfeited the gains since a [Jan. 31 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-positive-move-as-nasdaq-again-rallies-more-than-3-percent/). In a bullish uptrend, this simply does not happen.


Fast-forward to this past Friday? The stock market looks even weaker. And it's not just the highfliers of 2020-2021 that showed extreme valuations in the form of triple-digit price-to-earnings ratios. More blue chip companies outside the tech and Covid-related areas of the market are facing stiffer headwinds in trying to keep their long-term uptrends intact.


Hammering The Retail Sector
---------------------------



Just look at former big winners in the retailing space, including **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), which closed beneath its 10-week moving average for the 11th straight week. [Living below the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-rule-is-the-stock-living-beneath-the-10-week-line/) is a sign that a stock's weakness could get prolonged.


Luxury furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) is struggling to stop its sharp sell-off, which has now taken shares 46% below a 744 peak. RH's Relative Strength Rating has dimmed to a 16. Home improvement chain **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) is caught between its falling 10-week moving average and 40-week line. Rival **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) has slumped in six of the past seven weeks. The Dow Jones  Industrial Average component closed beneath its 40-week moving average for the first time since early March 2021.


According to MarketSmith, HD's P-E ratio of 23 is just 1.1 times that of the S&P 500, based on trailing 12-month earnings.  TGT and RH both show a P-E ratio of 16, and LOW a 19.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP021822-289x300.jpg)The Nasdaq fell 1.2% to cap a 1.8% drop for the week. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, although it was a day of options expirations.


The tech-laden composite has now fallen in six of the past eight weeks. At 13,548, it's stooped more than 16% below an all-time peak of 16,212 set on Nov. 22.


Meanwhile, a weekly chart shows the Nasdaq's 10-week moving average sloping lower in a menacing way since early January. The S&P 500, down 0.7% Friday to end the week off 1.6%, hasn't traded this far below its own 10-week moving average since May 2020.


The Dow Jones industrials also got slammed this past week, off 1.9% after Friday's 0.7% drubbing. Dow Jones stocks such as **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) are on the south side of their 200-day lines. In a healthy market, leaders traverse on the north side of their key moving averages.


The 500, down 8.8% since Jan. 1 after rallying 26.9% in 2021, is now 9.7% below its all-time peak. The Nasdaq is down 13.4% year to date, the Dow down 6.2%.

Stock Market Leaders And Duds Today
-----------------------------------


**Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)), member of IBD's oil and gas equipment group, sports a 26% gain year to date. Shares remain in the buy zone from a cup breakout at 47.04.


[Please check out this new piece in IBD's New America section](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/oil-stocks-cactus-stock-boosted-as-covid-wanes/) for details on why the company's CEO is more bullish on U.S. energy activities today.


But **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)), **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) and **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) highlight the extremely tough market conditions that confront high-valuation firms.


A Laggard Among Techs
---------------------



Palantir, whose major clients include the U.S. Army, sank 16% for the week in the heaviest turnover since the week ended May 14, 2021. A 60% drop in Q4 earnings, no doubt, disappointed the Street, even as mutual funds owning PLTR shares have jacked up to 776 at the end of 2021 vs. 84 in Q3 of 2020.


[Palantir](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-falls-as-palantir-earnings-miss-revenue-outlook-edges-by-estimates/) is now in danger of doing a complete round trip of gains since debuting in the stock market on Sept. 30, 2020, closing that day on the NYSE at 9.50 after going public at 7.25 a share. Yet more remarkable? Even after plunging 63% from its all-time peak of 45, PLTR trades 52 times its fiscal 2022 expected earnings of 21 cents a share. The S&P 500 trades at roughly 19 times the estimated 2022 profit of $225 by Yardeni Research.


A [trendline-based buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) near 310 in Snowflake, a database software leader, has failed badly.


Snowflake Stock Analysis
------------------------


Snowflake's revenue growth continues to impress. Since at least the fiscal fourth quarter ended in January 2020, the company's top line has grown 110% or faster vs. year-ago levels. In the past four quarters alone, sales on average grew 108%. But based on analyst estimates, it might not be until fiscal 2023, ending in January that year, before the San Mateo, Calif., company escapes red ink and goes into the black.


This lack of earnings hasn't stopped mutual funds from diving in. At the end of December 2021, MarketSmith counts 1,369 mutual funds that own shares. That nearly doubles the 784 fund owners at the end of Q4 2020. At least three members of the IBD Mutual Fund Index — Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), Franklin Growth (FKGRX), and Harbor Mid Cap Growth (HAMGX) — own a piece of Snowflake's 306.3 million shares outstanding.


You know that the best mutual funds can and will sit tight for years for an investment to blossom. Can the individual investor do the same?


Technically, Snowflake is not doing horribly in the sense that shares finished Friday 32% off their 52-week high of 405.


But it will take a 48% rally for shares to get within spitting distance of that mark. Put another way, that's going to take a huge amount of institutional buying.


[The IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), meanwhile, hosts only a fraction of the tech companies it used to showcase during most of 2020.


Also In The Dow Jones
---------------------



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) and a [half position on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), is testing investors' patience as shares dropped for the sixth time in seven sessions.


The stock needs to find institutional-buying [support at the 200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) to avoid going into a deeper downtrend. Microsoft's long-term uptrend since the spring of 2009 remains intact.

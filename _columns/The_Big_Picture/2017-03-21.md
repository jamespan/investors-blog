  Financials, Small Caps Rocked As Market Outlook Weakens

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 got hit with a day of unequivocal institutional selling Tuesday as financials sold off hard, putting the market uptrend under pressure.


The bulls were in a good mood early Tuesday as strength in **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) boosted the Nasdaq to an all-time high. But that all changed quickly when a wave of selling hit the market just after the open.


The Nasdaq slumped 1.8%, weighed down by weakness in biotech and chip stocks. The S&P 500 lost 1.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave back 1.1%. Small caps fared the worst, with the Russell 2000 down 2.6%. The Russell not only dived below the 50-day moving average, but also took out the March 14 low of 1353.47. The major indexes also slid below their previous March lows.

There were no daunting headlines that fueled the selling, although some opined that a defeat Thursday for House Speaker Paul Ryan's bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare could also have negative implications on tax reform, a big reason behind the market's lofty gains postelection.


The Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) plunged below its 50-day moving average, falling 2.9%. Volume was the heaviest for a down day in months. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) slumped 2.8%, ending just above the 50-day line.


Steel producers also sold off. **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) took hits, down 5% and 7% respectively, even after both firms raised earnings guidance last week.


Gold and silver miners outperformed along with utility stocks.


For the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, the session amounted to a bearish "outside day." That's when the day's high and low exceed that of the prior session. Not only did the Nasdaq's intraday spread exceed Monday's, but it also exceeded the highs and lows of the past 22 sessions — a rare occurrence that adds to the bearish case. The Nasdaq showed similar price action in March 2004 and July 1986 just ahead of further declines.


Keep in mind that the market's sudden change in character doesn't necessarily mean it's going into a correction. More distribution would worsen conditions, however, so it's important to keep monitoring. Also note that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are nearing a potential test of support at the 50-day moving average. A break of support at those levels would likely be enough to put the market in a correction.


For now at least, it's important to be off margin and start reducing exposure. Consider taking some profits and sell quickly any stock that falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price.


Money flowed out of stocks and into bonds, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 4 basis points to 2.42%. April West Texas Intermediate crude oil, meanwhile, settled at $47.34 a barrel, down 1.8%. The May contract becomes the front-end contract Wednesday.


After the close, **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) initially slumped 4% in after-hours trading on an earnings miss, but reversed higher by 2%. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) fell 1% as sales missed.

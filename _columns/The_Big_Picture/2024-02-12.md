The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended four-day win streaks with negative price reversals on the stock market Monday, while all the buying shifted to small caps. A few more high-rated stocks broke out, adding to a wave of emerging leadership.




One session after closing above 5,000 for the first time, the S&P 500 reversed to close 0.1% lower, at 5,021. Selling began to pick up at 1:30 p.m. ET.


The Nasdaq, which climbed as much as 0.6%, closed 0.3% lower. Curiously, the index reversed lower just as it hit the 16,000 milestone. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%, marking another all-time closing high.


The IBD 50 underperformed with a drop of 0.6%. It would have been worse if not for a 29.3% surge in **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)).


While there may have been some apprehension about Tuesday's consumer price index report Monday afternoon, small caps sure didn't show it.


Small Caps Rule Stock Market
----------------------------


The Russell 2000 rallied nearly 1.8% and closed almost at session highs. It is now 45 points above the 2,000 level, and making a dash for the 2,071 it reached in December — the index's highest level in nearly two years.


While small caps were broadly higher, Invesco S&P Small Cap Consumer Staples ([PSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCC)) exchange traded fund ran up 2.5%, while the Invesco S&P Small Cap Consumer Discretionary ([PSCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCD)) climbed 2.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP021224-.jpg)The Russell 2000 has been lagging the major stock market indexes, up 1.6% year to date vs. an 8% rise for the Nasdaq and 5.9% gain for the S&P 500. Before Monday's rally, the Russell index was actually down for the year.


But the index has gone up 4.9% over the three-day rally.


In a research note Monday, David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, made a case for small caps.


The rise in interest rates since the start of the year probably hurt small-caps. With UBS forecasting a year-end benchmark yield of 3.5%, that supports small caps. Moreover, Lefkowitz said, small caps often outperform when rates are rising.


Also, after a 13% decline in earnings per share for the Russell 2000 in 2023, expectations are for 14% growth this year.


"We expect large-cap earnings growth to pickup in 2024 and small-cap profit trends are usually closely correlated with large-caps," Lefkowitz said. "In fact, small-caps should produce faster earnings growth relative to large-caps. The recent improvement in bank lending standards gives us more confidence in this view."


Breakouts Give New Blood To Stocks
----------------------------------


Most of the stock market's leaders broke out of bases in November or December and became too extended, leaving few choices for buyers.


But last week saw a torrent of breakouts — nearly three dozen, according to the Recent Breakouts list in [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). That means bulls got more ammunition to reload and take shots at new opportunities.


Last week's wave of breakouts didn't have any Microsofts, Amazons or other heavyweights. But the overall quality of the breakouts was still good. The average Composite Rating was 94.4 and the average EPS Rating 86.5. Most have A or B SMR Ratings.



These aren't small fry either, with an average market cap of $17.23 billion. It ranged from **OneSpaWorld**'s ([OSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSW)) capitalization at about $1.5 billion to **Synopsys**' ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) $86.61 billion market cap.


**Stellanis** ([STLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLA)), a major automaker with a market cap of nearly $77 billion, also was among last week's breakouts. Its EPS accelerated from 12% to 42% and 42% the past few quarters. **Kinsale Capital** ([KNSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNSL)), an [IBD Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) stock, remains in buy range from a cup-with-handle entry.


In terms of performance, there's reason to be encouraged, too. Most of last week's breakouts are above their 5% buy zones. **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) is nearing a 20% profit target from its buy point. To be sure, many remain in the buy range.


Stock Market Influence On Breakouts
-----------------------------------


All broke out from early-stage bases, which is another positive.


The stock market's unusual strength no doubt is helping to keep these breakouts going. In a harder market, many would have reversed below buy points. So far, **Sprout Social** ([SPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPT)) and **Idexx Laboratories** ([IDXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDXX)) have dipped back below their entries, and we're not talking about anything that would trigger a sell signal.


As always, the broad stock market will have a lot to say about the success of February's breakouts. Indexes look stretched and major milestones such as the S&P's 5,000 level sometimes bring out opportunistic sellers. So, trade with caution.


Mark Hackett, Nationwide Chief of Investment Research, said in a note he feels a sense of déjà vu to the same period last year, when the stocks were strong, the banking crisis had yet to erupt and investors seemed complacent.


"Right now, there's universal optimism and no risk embedded in the market, and it feels like we're a rubber band being stretched thin," he noted. "As soon as that rubber band gets a little nick in it, it could snap, leading to extreme volatility. I would caution investors to sit tight during this period."

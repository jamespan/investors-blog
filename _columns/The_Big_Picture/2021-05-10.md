The stock market held to a similar script Monday, with large-cap technology stocks under pressure again, while mining, steel and building-sector stocks outperformed. Rising commodity prices continue to fuel inflation fears, but the 10-year Treasury yield didn't move much, up 2 basis points to 1.60%.




After a bullish gain Friday in strong volume, **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) jumped 4.7% to 80.45 Monday. It's near the top of an 11-week consolidation with a 83.25 buy point. Iron ore miner **BHP Group** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) added 1.8% to 80.83. It's near the top of a cup base with a 81.92 entry.


But the real story was another sell-off in the Nasdaq and a weak close for the S&P 500. Higher volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq resulted in another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for each index. The count now stands at five each, which is higher than normal.

The market's defensive posture was on full display as money flowed into the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)), up 1%, and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)), up 0.8%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average looked poised to extend its winning streak to six sessions when it topped the 35,000 level. But the blue-chip index reversed slightly lower, down 0.1%. The S&P 500 fell 1% and closed slightly below its 10-day moving average.


Several Dow Jones stocks are near buy points, like **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), but weak [Relative Strength Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) don't stir much excitement.


The S&P 500 delivered a couple of breakouts Monday, but **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) and **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) also have weak RS Ratings. Still, Best Buy powered past a 123.97 entry, and Kroger jumped past a 38.49 buy point after finding support at its 50-day line.


It's best at this point to look for stocks with strong RS Ratings that are building sound [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), along with a relative strength lines that are at or near new high ground.


The Nasdaq composite slumped 2.5%, while weakness in large-cap technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell 2.6%. After two straight gains for the Nasdaq composite on Thursday and Friday, the index's advance-decline line started to point higher, but the A/D line has been trending lower since the Nasdaq's mid-February high of 14,175.



Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by more than 3-to-1. Losers topped winners on the NYSE by nearly 3-to-1.


The stock market uptrend resumed Friday, thanks to an all-time closing high for the S&P 500. The uptrend came [under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) last week when the Nasdaq composite paid a visit to its 50-day line on May 4, falling 1.9% in higher volume. It was a harsh distribution day, but the index held at its 50-day moving average. After Monday's selling, the Nasdaq is again testing support at its 50-day.


There's still plenty of strength in the stock market coming from metals, mining, energy, fertilizer, shipping, housing and some retail stocks.


Semiconductor Stocks Hit Hard
-----------------------------


Semiconductor stocks lagged. After gapping above its 50-day line Friday, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) slumped 4.4%. Chip equipment stocks in the Nasdaq 100 took big hits, including **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Lam Resesarch** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)).


Sentiment was weak in the semiconductor sector after **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) said April revenue fell more than 13% from March. The stock has been getting resistance at its 50-day line since hitting a high of 127.40 in early April.

Reports of Apple using in-house 5G modems for its 2023 iPhones also fueled selling in the chip sector, particularly in Apple suppliers like **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)).



The selling in the Nasdaq eventually found its way into the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which fell 2.2%. Top gainers in the IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks included Southern Copper, **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) and **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)).


After breaking out of a cup base Friday, MarineMax followed through Monday but closed near its session low. Shares still rose 1.3%.


Medifast is thinly traded, but it's a high-priced stock, giving it an acceptable average daily dollar volume of around $34 million. After gapping above its 50-day line last week on strong earnings, [Medifast cleared a consolidation Monday](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-to-watch-ibd-50-stock-medifast-stages-breakout-after-187-percent-gain/), rising nearly 6%.


Energy Stocks Fade
------------------


Some top-rated [oil and gas producers popped early but reversed lower](https://www.investors.com/research/exxon-stock-xom-breaks-out-oil-plays-surge-4-stocks-in-buy-range/) by the close. **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) rose 3.5% early and came close to a 87.69 cup with handle buy point, but shares reversed lower. Group peer **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) also gave back early gains after topping a conventional entry of 42.41. **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) also reversed lower after a breakout attempt past a 169.59 buy point.

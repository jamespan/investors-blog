  Stocks Volatile After Fed Goes With Bigger Rate Cut; Why Market Outlook Could Change Soon

The stock market waited 2-1/2 years for this day, and it wasn't sure what to do after the Fed officially ended a tightening policy that began in March 2022.




Indexes were erratic Wednesday afternoon. The initial announcement of a 50-basis-point rate cut was the larger of two scenarios, and it motivated buyers. The Nasdaq initially climbed more than 1%, and the Russell 2000 rallied more than 2%. But investors soon tempered their enthusiasm.


As Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke with reporters, indexes erased most or all gains. That came despite a generally dovish Q&A session from Powell. Sellers took control in the final hour, leaving the main indexes at session lows at the closing bell.


The S&P 500 closed 0.3% lower, diminishing its intraday record high to just a footnote. The Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 escaped with a gain of less than 0.1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Tuesday's levels. That meant the Nasdaq and S&P 500 picked up a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


Despite its volatile action Wednesday, the S&P 500's intraday advance was enough to cause the deletion of the Sept. 6 distribution day, which offset Wednesday's new distribution day. The index climbed more than 5% from that day's close, meaning it should no longer factor into the current market analysis.


Yet the Nasdaq now has a half-dozen days of higher-volume losses, and the S&P has four such days. Those numbers point to a trend of institutional selling that needs to be watched closely in the coming days.


Stock Market Holds Up For Now
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091824-230x300.jpg)The overall technical profile of the major indexes remained largely unchanged even after the wild afternoon. The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 continued to hold above their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


On Wednesday, decliners topped advancers by 7-to-4 on the Nasdaq and by 8-to-7 on the NYSE. Every S&P sector index fell except for Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)), which added 0.2%.


But in broader terms, breadth has been improving. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), for example, made a record high Wednesday before reversing lower 0.2%. Stocks making new 52-week highs have been far outnumbering new lows.


In a positive sign for leading growth stocks, the IBD 50 0utperformed with a 0.3% increase.


But breakouts Wednesday followed the market's weak afternoon. Eight stocks in the [IBD MarketSurge 250 index](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) topped buy points; in all cases, they finished below their entries.


Mixed market signals mean the stock market is seeking direction and investors have to be prepared in case of a larger drawdown. IBD's recommended exposure remained at 60%-80%, but it would be smart to be cautious while the market tries to figure out its direction.


Stock Market Moves On Powell Comments
-------------------------------------


Buyers had been guarded ahead of the Fed's announcement. In a press briefing, Powell expressed confidence that the Fed can reach its goal of 2% inflation while keeping the U.S. economy on good footing.


Powell said there was "broad support" for the [50-basis-point cut](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-start-sp-500-jerome-powell/) among members of the Federal Open Market Committee, although one member dissented. The Fed penciled in another half point in rate cuts by the end of the year.


The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed four basis points to 3.68%, the largest one-day increase since Aug. 22.


Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in written comments that a more prolonged and predictable easing cycle is at hand.


"It now will be a battle between market expectations and the Fed, with employment data — not inflation data — determining which side is right," McIntyre said. "Since this policy move was mostly telegraphed, there is no outsized move in financial markets. Now, everyone is back to data dependency."


Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said the Fed's dot-plot changed substantially. Fed policymakers now expect another six cuts by the end of 2025, which is much closer to current market pricing.


"Should this rate path come to fruition, the 10-year Treasury will likely move higher on the back of stronger expected economic momentum," Schulze said. "This would rhyme with prior soft landing cutting cycles as the 10-year Treasury has historically moved higher in a sell-the-news fashion following the initial rate cut. Going forward, we expect the Fed will move in 25 bp (basis point) increments to further recalibrate policy barring a material deterioration in the labor market."

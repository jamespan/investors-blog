Sellers made their presence felt in the stock market Tuesday, but the Nasdaq composite held up relatively well as large-cap technology stocks outperformed again.




Biotech stocks lagged after the [Federal Trade Commission sued to block](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hznp-stock-crashes-on-reports-the-ftc-could-block-its-takeover-by-amgen/) **Amgen**'s ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) $27.8 billion acquisition of **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)). The news fueled broad-based selling in IBD's biotech group, which was one of the day's worst performers, down 2.4%. The biotech group was among more than 30 groups in IBD's database that fell 2% or more.


**Seagen** ([SGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGEN)) plunged 6% in heavy volume. In March, **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) announced plans to acquire the company for $43 billion. The fear is that the FTC could intervene here, too.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite rose to its highest level since late August before sellers knocked the index lower during the final half-hour of trading. The Nasdaq ended with a loss of 0.2%. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1. Volume rose slightly from Monday.


The index was led once again by strength in large-cap technology names like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).


AMD stock cleared a 102.53 buy point from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in solid volume. Amazon is still in a buy zone from a 110.96 entry, while Alphabet continued its ascent after last week's breakout.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) extended gains after retaking its 50-day moving average Monday. But a 1% midday gain faded to flat by the close. Chip firm **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)) rose for the fifth straight session and cleared a 51.98 entry in higher volume. Volume was the heaviest for an up day since May 2. Rambus has turned into a stock market leader after a big breakout during the week ended Nov. 4.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP051623--216x300.jpg)The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as it clings to its short-term moving averages. Weakness in solar stocks like **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) and **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) weighed on the S&P. In the oil and gas sector, **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) and **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) ended with losses of 3% to 4%.


Losers beat winners on the NYSE by nearly 4-to-1. Volume rose, giving the S&P 500 another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


After firming up near its 50-day moving average the past few days, the Dow Jones Industrial Averages slumped 1% and closed below the line. Investors sold **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) after the company reported revenue below expectations and gave a weak outlook. Home Depot was in a group of seven stocks in the blue-chip index that lost at least 2%.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) swooned 1.4%.


Money flowed out of bonds again, lifting the 10-year yield for the third straight session. The yield was around 3.54% just after 4:15 p.m. ET, just below its 200-day moving average near 3.58%. The 200-day line is a potential resistance level to watch.


Distribution Days
-----------------


The accompanying Market Pulse graphic shows a high distribution-day count for the S&P 500. But only two of those days really had the feel of institutional selling. One was on April 25, when the index fell 1.6%; the other was on May 2, when the index fell 1.2%.

Headed into Tuesday, the Nasdaq showed four distribution days. But the count now stands at three because the April 11 distribution day fell off the count due to time.


With the major stock indexes in a confirmed uptrend, it makes sense having some exposure to stocks — but not more than 40% at this point. Market breadth still leaves a lot to be desired as the stock market grapples with the prospect of a sharp slowdown for the U.S. economy.


The market's narrow breadth is best seen by looking at a daily chart for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), which remains on a downtrend and stuck below all of its key moving averages. On a day that saw the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fall 0.6%, RSP lost 1.4%.


The Nasdaq 100 told a similar story Tuesday. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) inched up 0.1%, but the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) slumped nearly 1%.

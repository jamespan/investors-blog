The stock market sold off sharply despite a surprise jump in weekly jobless claims, as investors hunkered down ahead Friday's pivotal February jobs report. The S&P 500 broke down below its 50-day support level.




Initial unemployment claims jumped to 211,000, above Econoday expectations that called for a slight increase to 195,000 vs. 190,000 in the previous week. Low weekly jobless claims continue to demonstrate the sustained strength in the labor market, which is fueling market fears that the Federal Reserve could keep hiking interest rates for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower, at 3.94% late Thursday.


Investors are bracing for Friday's [pivotal jobs report from the Labor Department.](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/why-a-soft-jobs-report-wont-save-the-sp-500-from-fed-hawks/) Economists expect a rise of 220,000 in February nonfarm payrolls, with an unemployment rate of 3.4%. In January, payrolls surged 517,000, nearly double Econoday's high estimate. Average hourly earnings are expected to grow 0.3%.


As the stock market uptrend faces increasing selling pressure over fears of rising interest rates, there are a few leading stocks near buy points, including [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), IPO stock **Nextracker** ([NXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXT)) and **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)).


Earnings Results
----------------


On the earnings front, **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) were on the move.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP030923_new2-262x300.jpg)Asana soared nearly 19% after [reporting strong Q4 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asana-stock-asana-earnings-asan-stock-q42022/) and issuing strong guidance. JD plunged 11.3% even after [handily beating expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jd-stock-china-ecommerce-firm-beats-q4-goals/) for the fourth quarter to reach the lowest level since Nov. 3. And MDB stock dived 8.4% after [the company issued weak revenue guidance.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mdb-stock-mongodb-drops-on-fourth-quarter-report/)


The [price of Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/) plunged more than 8% Thursday, as crypto bank **Silvergate Capital** ([SI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SI)) [crashed 42%](https://www.investors.com/news/si-stock-silvergate-capital-to-shut-down-liquidate-crypto-friendly-silvergate-bank/) on news that it will shut down operations and liquidate its subsidiary Silvergate Bank.


Shares of Silicon Valley banker **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) crumbled more than 60% after the company launched a $2.25 billion set of offerings after reporting a $1.8 billion loss in its Treasurys and mortgage-backed portfolio investments.


Banking stocks came under assault. SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) slid 7.3%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7% and the S&P 500 declined nearly 1.9%. The Nasdaq dived more than 2%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 stumbled 2.8%. The Nasdaq is testing  the 50-day line. And the S&P 500 broke through its 50-day line, signaling further weakness could be on the horizon. All three main indexes closed below the 200-day averages.


Volume eased on the Nasdaq and roses on the NYSE from the prior session, resulting in a new distribution day for the S&P 500. That's five for the S&P.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 3.1% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks stopped just short of support around the 50-day line.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Mobileye** **Global** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) fell just 0.3% Thursday, looking to continue its bounce off the key 10-week line. Shares are forming the right side of a new base, but it is still early in the base-building process.


Following Thursday's sell-off, IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) was downgraded back to an "uptrend under pressure," which means investors should scale back their exposure. An exposure level between 40% and 60% makes sense. Stocks have gone nowhere but lower this week amid Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments, which doused last Friday's big gains.

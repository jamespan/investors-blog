The stock market ended modestly higher Thursday, as Wall Street awaited inflation data early Friday.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, bouncing further from the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 also rose 0.1%, while the Nasdaq moved up 0.3%, extending a win streak to three sessions and narrowly missing a record closing high. The small-cap Russell 2000 index outperformed with a 1% advance, closing just above the 50-day moving average.


Volume rose modestly on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Up next, the Commerce Department will release its personal income and outlays report ahead of Friday's stock market open. Personal income is expected to rise 0.4% in May, with spending expected to increase 0.3%. The personal consumption expenditure price index is expected to rise 0.1% on the month, with an annual increase of 2.6%. Core prices, excluding food and energy, are set to rise 0.1% in May, with a year-over-year increase of 2.6%.


In addition to this widely watched inflation data, three top Fed officials are [scheduled to give remarks Friday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD is keeping its recommended stock market exposure at 80% to 100%. Because market leadership remains concentrated in the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), there is reason for caution. And exposure closer to 80% makes the most sense.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) ETF both rose 0.1%.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list perked up Thursday, with four new breakouts, including **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), which is an [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock. And there are a number of top growth stocks near buy points, so keep an eye out for strong breakout moves.

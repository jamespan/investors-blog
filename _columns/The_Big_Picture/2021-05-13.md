Stock Market Snaps Three-Day Losing Streak, As S&P 500 Rebounds From Critical Support Level
============================================================================================

The stock market ended sharply higher Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 snapped back from Wednesday's big losses to end a three-day losing streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed after slashing gains.




The Nasdaq rose 0.7% Thursday. The S&P 500 climbed 1.2%, while the Dow Jones industrials gained 1.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.6%.


Leading growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2% Thursday. While most [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stocks rose, **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) stumbled almost 5% to break below its long-term 200-day moving average, deepening its slump.


Volume ended slightly lower on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP051321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP051321-246x300.jpg)One day after the [IBD market outlook was downgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-plunges-on-inflation-signals-some-steps-investors-must-take-now/) to "uptrend under pressure," the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 proved why they continue to be the leading indexes right now. Both logged strong gains Thursday. The S&P 500 rebounded from its key 50-day moving average, a support level.


Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq remains below its 50-day line. The next potential support level to watch for the tech-heavy composite is around 12,800, or the March lows.


The S&P 500 holds six days of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), while the Nasdaq has five. Given the high amount of selling, investors should only focus on exceptional breakouts, while reducing overall market exposure.


Despite Thursday's stock market advance, there is clearly a high amount of risk. Many recent breakouts have faded, while some have outright failed. For example, **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) on Wednesday triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) from a 64.09 buy point.


Bitcoin Plunges
---------------


Bitcoin plunged more than 10%, trading around $48,700 Thursday afternoon after [Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203/photo/1) that "Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel."


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock skidded over 3% Thursday, extending this week's losses to 15%. The electric-vehicle titan is now just below its [long-term 200-day line](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-bitcoin-price-fall-after-elon-musk-halts-cryptocurrency-use-for-vehicle-purchases/) for the first time since March 2020.

---------------------------------------------------


**MasterCraft** ([MCFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCFT)) broke out past a 30.50 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 10.8% surge Thursday, closing at 32.19. The 5% buy area tops out at 32.03, so the stock is already extended.


[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) is tracing a [cup-shape base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with an 83.25 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis.](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) Shares lost 2% Thursday. According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [SCCO stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-southern-copper-corp-scco.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


[Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/yeti-earnings-q1-2021-yeti-stock/), **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)), reversed from early losses to advance over 5% Thursday, finding much-needed support around its 80.99 buy point and the 50-day moving average. Early Thursday, the company easily beat the Street's earnings and sales targets.


Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) is holding near highs, indicating solid performance in a volatile stock market environment.

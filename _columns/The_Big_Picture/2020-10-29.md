Stocks Rebound, But Apple Tumbles On Earnings; Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook Also Report
======================================================================================

The stock market rebounded Thursday, following Wednesday's stock market rout. The Nasdaq composite advanced as much as 2.6% before cutting gains. Late Thursday, tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook reported their quarterly earnings results. Reactions were sharply mixed.




The Nasdaq outperformed with a 1.6% advance. The S&P 500 rallied 1.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with a 0.5% rise. The small-cap Russell 2000 also climbed 1.2%. While those were good gains, they were far short of erasing the 3%-plus losses suffered Wednesday.


Leading growth stocks performed well, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF rallied 1.2%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) soared 26.7% after **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) [announced plans](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-marvell-technology-inphi-merge/) to buy Inphi for about $10 billion. Meanwhile, **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) advanced 6.2% to retake its 50-day moving average.


Volume was modestly lower from Wednesday's session on the NYSE, while sharply lower on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq's light volume removed some of the day's bullish slant.


Stock Market Rebounds
---------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP_5x3_102920-226x300.jpg)Amid Thursday's positive price action, the Nasdaq is still clinging to life, but remains in a precarious position — it fell below its 50-day moving average this week for the first time since Oct. 2. All three major stock indexes are now below their critical 50-day support levels.


The Nasdaq has [three distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since the Sept. 30 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has an elevated five distribution days.


An uptrend under pressure means investors need to be much more cautious, but not overly bearish, so don't be 100% in cash. Watch top stocks for potential sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to reduce exposure.


Avoid making new purchases for now, unless the breakout is powerful and the company is a stock market leader. The best candidates are those that prove most resilient during stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with [strong relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). These ideas have a good shot at becoming new leaders.

Tech Earnings: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook
------------------------------------------------


Tech giants **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) all reported earnings results late Thursday.


Alphabet reported [third-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-googl-stock-q3-2020/) and revenue that handily topped estimates. The internet giant said earnings rose 62% from a year earlier to $16.40 per adjusted share. Revenue rose 14% to $46.17 billion. Shares soared 7% after the close.


The parent of Google is close to forming a cup with handle with a 1,634.22 buy point.


Amazon reported [better-than-expected Q3 results.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-amazon-earnings/) The e-commerce giant reported adjusted earnings of $12.37 per share on revenue of $96.1 billion. Shares fell about 1% in extended trade.


Amazon stock is tracing a cup with handle with a 3,496.34 buy point. Shares ended Thursday just below the 50-day line and has been near the line for about two weeks.


Apple [beat Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-earnings-q4-2020-aapl-stock/) for the September quarter, earning 73 cents a share on sales of $64.7 billion. Shares declined as much as 5.3% in extended trade before paring losses.


Apple stock ended below its 50-day line despite Thursday's 3.7% advance.


Facebook reported [Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-earnings-revenue-third-quarter-report-2020-fb/) that came in well above Wall Street estimates, including user growth. The social media giant reported adjusted earnings of $2.71 per share on revenue of $21.5 billion. Shares edged higher after the close.


Shares are on track to form a cup with handle, which would make 285.34 the proper buy point.


Stocks In Or Near Buy Zones: Chewy, JD.com
------------------------------------------


**Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) is below its 70.82 buy point in a cup with handle, just one day after the stock broke out of that entry. Thursday's 6% loss underscores the danger of buying new breakouts during a market uptrend under pressure.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [the stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-chewy-inc-cl-a-chwy.aspx) has an 86 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.


Chewy was Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chewy-stock-ibd-stock-day-new-vet-service-pet-care-chwy/), as the stock made its breakout.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) is rapidly approaching a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) 85.49 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock is about 3% away from the new entry after Thursday's 3.7% gain.

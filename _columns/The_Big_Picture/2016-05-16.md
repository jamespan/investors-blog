News of a Warren Buffett stake in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), rising oil prices and a drug merger fueled positive sentiment throughout Monday’s session as stocks ended with solid gains in mixed volume.


Apple jumped nearly 4% after Buffett disclosed that he owned 9,811,747 shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the first quarter. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), meanwhile, struck a deal to acquire biotech **Anacor** ([ANAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANAC)) for just over $5 billion. Pfizer is keen on Anacor’s eczema drug, currently being reviewed by the FDA. Anacor surged 57%. Pfizer edged 0.6% higher.


The Nasdaq gapped up at Monday’s open and never looked back. It rose 1.2% in slightly higher volume. The S&P 500 and Dow picked up 1% each. Volume on the NYSE fell slightly. The Russell 2000 small-cap index and IBD 50 performed mostly in line with the Nasdaq.


The S&P 500’s April 11 distribution day dropped off the count due to time, but risks remain in the market.


![MP_051616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP_051616-192x300.jpg)Breadth was pretty good, with NYSE advancers beating decliners by more than 3-to-1. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was slightly better than 2-to-1.


Money flowed out of bonds and into stocks as the 10-year Treasury yield rose 5 basis points to 1.75%.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil for June delivery rose $1.51, or 3.3%, to $47.72 a barrel after Goldman Sachs, a noted bear on oil in recent months, flipped bullish, saying WTI crude could hit $50 a barrel in the second half of the year.


The Nasdaq’s strong price action was encouraging, but risks remain. Plus, the index shows five distribution days since April 28, and the performance of leading growth stocks has been a mixed bag at best.


Monday’s session served up a breakout from **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)). A March 4 breakout over a 17.85 never gained much traction, but MaxLinear cleared a new entry of 19.20 Monday. It closed 1% above the buy point.


China stocks did well. Inside the IBD 50 **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) jumped 5.5%. It’s still 13% off its 52-week high, though, as it works on the right side of a possible base. New Oriental Education ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), meanwhile, scored another all-time high, rising 4%.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) also outperformed, rising nearly 3%, but it remained 16% off its 52-week high. Still, the stock’s technical picture has improved, and a breakout attempt over the 80 level isn’t out of the question.


Finally, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) bounced off its 50-day moving average in heavy volume ahead of its earnings report Tuesday before the open. It closed just below a 135.57 buy point.


The market’s gains were impressive despite a weak reading on regional manufacturing activity as well as comments from Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who said the case for a rate hike in June "looks to be pretty strong." Lacker is a noted hawk, though, and is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee.


According to CME Group FedWatch, the odds of a rate hike at the June 15 meeting are 4%. For the July 27 meeting, the odds move up a bit to 20%.


In other economic news, a volatile regional manufacturing survey missed expectations by a mile. The New York Federal Reserve’s Empire State manufacturing index fell to -9.02 in May from April’s 9.56 and March’s 0.56. Economists had expected a positive reading of 7.0.

Stocks Stall; Does That Threaten Market's Bounce?
==================================================

The stock market seemed ready to continue its rebound Wednesday morning but sellers waded back in the afternoon, leaving the week's progress stalled.




The Nasdaq composite had climbed as much 0.7% but closed with a 0.2% increase. The S&P 500 also trimmed its gain, closing only 0.1% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1% as well.


Indexes closed in the lower third of Wednesday's price range. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which gave the composite an eighth [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), this one by virtue of stalling. Volume was higher on the NYSE, which gave the S&P 500 a stalling day as well.


The market bounced briefly after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting came out, but the selling soon resumed. The Fed's policymakers discussed the persistently low inflation and a possible September announcement to start unwinding its massive balance sheet.


The Russell 2000 behaved no better, ending the day with a minimal gain. The small-cap benchmark rose from a touch of the 200-day moving average last week, but this week it's been lagging again, as it has for much of the year.

Granted, many of those days of higher-volume losses were mild in character. In the past, the market has been able to withstand such a high number of distribution days.


Still, they represent days when institutional investors sold more than normal. Moreover, there's been a cluster of distribution in the past week and a half.


This week started out promising, but there's been no follow through from buyers. On Monday, stocks rallied after a thaw in the U.S.-North Korea missile standoff. Tuesday's minor losses were normal considering Monday's gains. On Wednesday, buyers continued to stay at bay.


While the Nasdaq has led all year, there's evidence that selling is more pervasive right now in the composite. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating has dropped to the lowest-possible E. The S&P has a C- rating.


Also, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been sloping downward more than the NYSE's line over the past three weeks.


Is it time to flee into the safety of cash? No, at least not yet. Leading stocks continue to move acceptably well, save for a minority whose breakouts have produced little or no fruit.


After Thursday's rout, a couple of signals indicated that indexes would make a low, and so far those signals are holding. The put-call volume ratio spiked to 1.14 Friday, while the [CBOE Market Volatility Index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) surged more than 20% above its 10-day moving average.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain above the 50-day moving averages, and as long as they stay above those lines it's a positive sign.


Metals, mining and some retail stocks led Wednesday's trading. Metals prices climbed amid supply problems and a crackdown in China on illegal aluminum mining.



The homebuilding industry group rose nearly 1% after U.S. housing starts fell 4.8% in July to a two-month low and below most forecasts. But the prior two months were revised higher.


A few of the Chinese stocks that had been hot fell in heavy trading.


**YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) remain extended, but **Ctrip.com** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)) continued to plunge below its 50-day line.

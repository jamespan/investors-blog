Stocks tried for a comeback, but big selling in the last hour sealed a third straight loss Monday.

  

The S&P 500 tumbled 1.6%, breaking its 200-day moving average, which it had been above since November 2012. It also breached support at the 1900 level. Energy, which makes up about 10% of the benchmark index, was one of the day's worst-performing groups.

  

The Nasdaq slumped 1.5%. It was up as much as 0.4%, but turned tail after hitting resistance at its 200-day line.

  

Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have erased most of their gains for the year. At their Sept. 19 highs, they were up as much as 10% and 9%, respectively.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000, which had already topped in early July, lost a milder 0.4%.

  

Volume dropped on both major exchanges due to the Columbus Day holiday. Losers beat winners by 2-to-1 on the NYSE and about 5-to-4 on the Nasdaq. The put-call jumped to 1.41 from 1.16 Friday. Readings above 1.0 tend to mark short-term bounce, but this has not worked recently.

  

Monday's action clearly showed that the stock market is in distribution phase with sellers in control. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have breached their 200-day moving averages. The line can be viewed as a long-term trend indicator.

  

Leaders also have come under fire. On Monday, **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) plunged 21% after cutting its Q3 profit outlook. New issues **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) and **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) fell hard. Both are in the final week of IBD's eight-week hold rule for fast movers. The IBD 50 slumped 3.2%.

  

The number of new lows 52-week lows are swamping the number of new highs. Stocks scoring new highs are coming from defensive sectors such as food/beverage and utilities (see B1).

  

Preserving capital is key now. Growth stocks, which tend to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times compared with the general market. So investors should be reducing exposure to stocks.

  

Sell any stock that hands you a loss of 7% or 8%. Sell stock that are back to even after rising at least 10%. Focus on stocks in which you have a large profit cushion and can ride out a market correction.

  

Earnings reports will start rolling in Tuesday, with **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) among others reporting. While big quarterly increases are important. It's the market's reaction that'll tell you if there are any buyers left. Stocks that can't rally on good news is bad news.

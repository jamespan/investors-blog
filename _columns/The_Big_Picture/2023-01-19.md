The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a third straight day Thursday, but the stock market ended off its morning lows despite a final hour of selling. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) earnings came out after the close, kicking off fourth-quarter tech earnings. [NFLX stock jumped around 6%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-fourth-quarter-subscribers-beat-views/) in extended trade.




Meanwhile, three leading stocks that offer new buy points include [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)), **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) and **Vertex****Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).


Economic Data, Earnings
-----------------------


Initial unemployment claims dropped to 190,000 vs. 205,000 in the previous week. Claims were expected to rise to 215,000, per Econoday estimates. The unexpected drop signals continued strength in the labor market despite ongoing layoffs in the technology sector.


On Wednesday, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) [announced plans](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-software-giant-discloses-layoffs/) to lay off 10,000 employees, or about 4.5% of its workforce. The move comes amid a slowdown in its core businesses and big investments in opportunities like artificial intelligence and cloud computing.


Elsewhere on the economic front, housing starts and permits and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index also came out. Housing starts and permits for December fell to 1.382 million and 1.330 million vs. expectations for 1.362 million and 1.380 million, respectively. The Philly Fed index came in at -8.9 in January, better than the expected -10.3 reading and higher from a -13.8 reading in December.


**Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) and **Discover Financial Services** ([DFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFS)) reported earnings late Wednesday, while **Fastenal** ([FAST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) earnings came out ahead of Thursday's open.


Alcoa shares slid more than 7.3%, while Discover stock slashed losses to just 0.4%. Fastenal was down 1.6%. And P&G stock declined more than 2%, breaking below its 200-day line.

Dow Jones Today
---------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.8%, and the S&P 500 also lost 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite sold off 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed their recently reclaimed 50-day moving averages. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP011923_2-261x300.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. the prior session. Lower volume means the Nasdaq and S&P 500 avoided another distribution day. Remember, investors should be wary of a clustering of distribution days, which is a bearish indicator that represents institutional selling.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost nearly 2% Thursday as the ETF extended a losing streak to three sessions. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy giant **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) climbed 2.2%, nearing a 142.26 buy point. Valero was [Wednesday's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-energy-leader-valero-eyes-buy-point/) pick.


IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) remains "confirmed uptrend," despite losses over the last two to three sessions. Given the market's recent skid, it makes sense to remain conservatively invested, with an invested percentage of 20%-40%.



Solar Stocks Lose Their Luster
------------------------------


Solar stocks were among the worst performers Thursday, as **Array Technologies** ([ARRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRY)), **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), **First S****olar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) and **Shoals Technologies** ([SHLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLS)) all finished with big losses.


Array shares tumbled 4.4%, First Solar lost 7.1%. And Shoals Technologies declined 5.7%. Still, all three remain above their 50-day lines. Enphase shares dived 10.9% to hit their lowest level since July. Finally, SolarEdge stumbled 10.3% to give up its 50-day line in heavy volume.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Monster, Vertex
----------------------------------------------


Monster Beverage is fighting for support around its 50-day line; it fell 0.9% Thursday. Shares are tracing a flat base with a 104.75 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


[Monster Beverage](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mnst-stock-tinkers-with-early-entry-analysts-see-strong-earnings/) leads an energy-drink duopoly with privately held competitor Red Bull. The company's portfolio of energy drink brands include Monster Energy, Reign and NOS Energy.


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vrtx-stock-finds-support-as-billions-in-potential-sales-stack-up/), Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is approaching a 324.85 buy point in a flat base after bullishly retaking its 50-day line this week. VRTX stock was down 0.6% Thursday.


The company is well-known for its cystic fibrosis treatments — a market that Vertex estimates at 88,000 patients. Of those, there are still 20,000 patients who could receive its old-school oral treatments. But analysts are watching for what's new from Vertex, including an updated regimen of three drugs that could strengthen Vertex's position against incoming rival **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)).

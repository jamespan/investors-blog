Stock Market Powers Higher After Three-Session Drubbing; Amazon, ServiceNow Find Support

Stock market bulls delivered a pretty clear message to the bears Wednesday: We're not going down without a fight.




Major stock indexes bounced back bullishly Wednesday after three straight declines knocked the Nasdaq composite 10% off its high. The Nasdaq is making a stand at its 50-day moving average, along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index. Several stock market leaders like **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) are doing the same thing. All four are [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks.


The Nasdaq closed with a gain of 2.7%; the S&P 500 added 2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.6%. The Russell 2000 picked up nearly 1.5%. Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Tuesday.


In the Nasdaq 100, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is testing its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) as it holds just above a 470.71 buy point. The stock, however, made a round-trip sell signal Tuesday. **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), meanwhile, briefly cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 326.46 entry but backed off highs by the close.


![2MP090920](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2MP090920-255x300.jpg)Adobe is also a Leaderboard stock and member of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 3.1% but closed just below its 50-day line.


Discount retailers also did well. **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) moved back above its 50-day line as it stays in buy range from a 194.94 buy point. **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG)) and **BJ's Wholesale** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) are also making stands at their 50-day lines, while **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) is trading tightly near highs after the stock gapped up last week over a 115.27 buy point.


Stock Market Uptrend Under Pressure
-----------------------------------


IBD lowered the market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" Tuesday when the Nasdaq fell 4.1% and closed slightly below its 50-day line. Volume fell from Friday so the index avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). But the S&P 500 added one with its 2.8% decline in higher volume.


The Nasdaq has two distribution days, but only one with a harsh decline. That was on Sept. 3, when it plunged 5% in higher volume. The other distribution day was a 0.3% decline on Aug. 27. Among the S&P 500's four distribution days, two had the feel of unequivocal institutional selling: Sept. 3 and Tuesday's sharp drop.


The Nasdaq fell 1.3% on Friday but the outlook stayed in "confirmed uptrend" because the Nasdaq pared losses significantly and closed near its high after coming close to its 50-day moving average. With a relatively light distribution count — plus the fact that top-rated growth stocks with bullish charts easily outnumber those with bearish ones — the market uptrend still must be respected.

But the current outlook is staying at "uptrend under pressure,"  which calls for greater caution. A move right back to highs for the Nasdaq is certainly possible, but short-lived pullbacks don't give leading growth stocks much time to consolidate and build new bases. It's hard to commit new money, for example, to names like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)). All four stocks, and plenty of others, would benefit by moving sideways for a while. The same can be said of the major stock indexes.


Also keep in mind that while excessive fear has been seen at stock market bottoms in the past, it's certainly not a fearful market at this point. During the market's three-day plunge, the put/call volume ratio ranged from 0.7 to 0.82, which is far from elevated fear.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Semiconductor stocks outperformed, helped by bullish guidance from **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)). The chipmaker gapped up above its 50-day line but closed near its low. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) climbed above its 50-day line and closed near its high, rising 2.9%.



Group peer **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), Wednesday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tsm-stock-holds-tight-rough-market/), continues to trade tightly and hold near highs after a breakout from a consolidation in July.


Gold stocks rallied for the second straight session, with IBD's mining group up 4.1%. Top stocks in the group like IBD 50 name **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) are finding support at their 50-day moving averages for the first time after breakouts. Other gold stocks with bullish weekly charts include **Wheaton Precious Metals** ([WPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPM)), **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)).


VanEck Vectors Gold MinersETF ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) was added to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) Wednesday.


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers fell in the latest week, according to the latest survey from Investors Intelligence. The bulls fell to 59% from 61.5% the prior week. The 61.5% reading was the highest since the September 2018 reading of 61.8% just before a sharp market pullback. The bulls/bears survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. When everyone's bullish, it's time to be bearish, and vice versa.

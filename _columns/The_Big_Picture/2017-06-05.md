title: Stocks Ease, Hold Near Record; Why Investors Need To Watch This Chart Pattern

 Stocks were modestly lower Monday, a day that seemed properly calm in the wake of two good weeks of gains.


The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 0.2% and the S&P 500 0.1%. In the past two weeks, they climbed 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1% as well.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP060517.png)Small caps returned to their lagging ways, as the Russell 2000 shaved off 0.6%. Volume fell across the board.


As static as indexes were, there's nothing abnormal on their charts. The number of distribution days has been drying up to favorable levels, with three on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500. Both indexes remain near record highs.


The Nasdaq is up 17% so far this year. If it stays at the current pace, it will end the year up more than 30%. That would be a return far above average, the type that occurs only after the market has reached a major bottom. In 2003, after the dot-com bust, the composite surged 50%. In 2009, after the financial crisis, it roared back 44%.


But if it feels like the market is not making progress lately, it's because stocks are rising at a historically slow pace. Volatility in the S&P 500 is unusually sleepy. The S&P has moved more than 1% only four times this year, compared with 25 times in the same periods earlier, according to RBC Capital Markets Chief Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub.


With volatility low, several leading stocks have formed three-weeks-tight or four-weeks-tight patterns. Those are formations that develop after stocks have emerged from breakouts, providing a secondary chance to add shares.


**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **Ceva** ([CEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEVA)) and **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) are some leaders that have topped buy points from such patterns. (Keep in mind that Ceva is thinly traded with just 167,000 shares exchanging hands on average; the dollar volume is less than $8 million.)


 If there's one complaint about the market, it's the shortage of top-shelf stocks forming sound bases. Some, such as **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), look superb but are frustratingly in late-stage formations. So investors can look at three-weeks-tight patterns and pullbacks to the 50-day moving average for new opportunities.
In the IBD 50, **TTM Technologies** ([TTMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTMI)) and **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) are forming bases, but Essent is trading persistently below its 50-day line.


Lost in the pattern drought is the fact that so many good stocks are extended from buy points, which is proof that they have been profitable investments. Many investors who make a point of buying at the proper buy point have come across plenty of winners so far in 2017.


Its been a big-cap technology market in 2017. Semiconductor and technology are among the best performers in the "Top Sector ETFs" table this year, up 20% or 21%. (The ETF table appears on page B6 of this week's IBD Weekly.)


A hot sector is no protection against a bad breakout, however. **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), whose breakout looked fantastic last week, is coming apart at the seams. Shares closed Monday almost 7% below the 84.34 buy point, and it triggered a stop-loss sell signal intraday.


At an industry group level, automaker, steel, some oil and gas, and shoe stocks led the market Monday. Most of those are low-ranked industry groups. Some medical, telecom and food were the weakest areas of Monday's trading.

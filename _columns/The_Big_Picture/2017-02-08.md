  Stocks Edge Up; Is Too Much Bullishness Bad For The Market?

At first blush, it may not be a good near-term omen for stocks when the Dow Jones utility average posts the biggest gain for the day.


Yet dull action seen in the major indexes on Wednesday indicated that the market uptrend, ignited by a follow-though day more than seven months ago on June 30, and kept alive by the Nov. 8 elections, is still in place.


Of course, on a stock-by-stock basis, the wild volatility seen in fundamentally strong companies reporting quarterly results has far from dissipated. **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) (in the IBD 50), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) (in Sector Leaders) and **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)) (entering Leaderboard briefly as an options play) provided all the proof anyone needs.


The Nasdaq composite rose for the third time in four sessions, ending Wednesday up 0.1% and good for a new all-time closing high. At 5682, the tech-dominated index continues to lead in 2017 with a 5.6% year-to-date gain.


The S&P 500 inched less than 2 points higher; the Dow Jones industrials and the Russell 2000 slipped less than 0.2%. Yet go to a daily chart and you'll notice a rather narrow trading range for all of these key indexes. Only five of the 30 stocks in the Dow rose or fell 1 point or more.


![mp020817](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP020817-177x300.png)What's more, all of the indexes finished toward the high end of their intraday ranges.


Was that a subtle clue that institutions are not in a hurry to take profits and increase cash? Perhaps.


On the other hand, while volume rose — just fractionally on the Nasdaq, more so on the NYSE — it's less meaningful when the key indexes make such tiny moves.


Overall, the market weather these days continues to reveal fewer bouts of heavy institutional selling than this winter's rash of rain in Southern California. As seen in the Market Pulse, the S&P 500 shows just three days of distribution, despite a stalling day that emerged on Tuesday. Based on IBD's Market School rules, a second stalling day only counts when there are more distribution days in total than stalling days. Thus, Tuesday's stalling was incorrectly counted as a distribution day.


Over the past 25 trading sessions, the S&P had a first stalling day on Jan. 10 when the index was flat, then posted a 0.3% decline on Jan. 17 and a 0.6% slide on Jan. 30.


The Nasdaq's five distribution days include two stalling days, on Jan. 20 (up 0.3%) and Feb. 7 (up 0.2%). Looking at the three distribution days, none of the three showed a decline of 1% or more. Rather, the average drop among the three (Jan. 17, 19 and 30) was a mild 0.6%.


As seen among stocks in the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and other growth screens, indeed, few stocks have flashed serious weakness. Most are trading above their 50-day moving averages, a good sign for the bulls.


The market internals and sector action appeared to show that institutions wanted to take some profits in the banking stocks. As the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield slumped to 2.34%, considerably off its Dec. 15 peak of 2.60%, banks fell and utilities rose. The Dow utility average gained 1% and is now up more than 1.5% for the year.


On the Nasdaq, losers edged winners by a roughly 9-to-7 margin. On the NYSE, winners won out by about 9 to 7.


New highs have cooled off in recent days, down from the 200-to-500 range seen in IBD's screened list of new highs from Jan. 24 to Jan. 27, roughly two weeks ago.


The banks definitely matter. As many as six of the top 20 industry groups come from the Banks or Finance sector. Some banks are definitely cooling off, spending more time below their 50-day moving averages, including **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)), **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) and **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)). This is normal. After all, banks are having their best rally in years, and the gains from proper bases formed in 2016 have been meaty.


Other top Wall Street and Main Street banks, meanwhile, are doing just fine, showing signs of buying support at the 50-day and 10-week moving averages. For weeks, two Sector Leaders, **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) and **Seacoast Banking** ([SBCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBCF)), have acted well.


The Investors Intelligence survey continues to show bullishness exceeding 60% in three of the past four weeks. (See the latest data at IBD's new [Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) page.) Yet the put-call volume ratio continues to hover near the 1.0 level, which marks a balance of bullish call and bearish put-option activity.


It seems like there's no shortage of folks trying to sell short as well. Meanwhile, [margin debt growth](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=margindebt) is nowhere near the frothy levels of 2007. Has a buddy asked you, "Is it time to short? What's the best way to do so?" Well, you're not alone.


Still, Wall Street strategists are still scratching their heads about what all the excessive optimism means.


Perhaps Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird, said it best by commenting that "investor optimism is difficult to dislodge" even though a mini-mountain of sentiment indicators gives Bittles' team the conclusion that market bullishness is at the highest in 19 months.


As an individual investor, your best approach is to block out all opinions and simply watch the tape. That is, the daily price-and-volume action of the major indexes will give you a sense of when the bull's character changes.

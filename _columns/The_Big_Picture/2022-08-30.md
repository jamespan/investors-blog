  Stock Market Extends Losses As Recession Fears Grow; Commodity Stocks Tumble

A bloodbath in commodity stocks fueled another round of selling in the stock market Tuesday. A sharp drop in crude oil sparked harsh downward moves for several top-rated oil and gas producers. Steel and coal stocks also got hammered as major stock indexes swooned below their 50-day moving averages.




The Nasdaq composite fell below its 50-day moving average and the 12,000 level, ending with a loss of 1.1%. Semiconductor stocks lagged again in the Nasdaq 100. So did **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which fell 2.5% and looks poised for a test of its 50-day line.


The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) fell 1%, bringing its three-session decline to around 8.4%. **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) stood out Tuesday with a gain of 3.5%.


GFS stock was among a small group of stocks in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) that bucked the selling. Others included **Elf Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)).


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell below their 50-day lines, with losses of 1.1% and 1%, respectively. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slumped 1.4%, but the small-cap ETF held above its 50-day line.

Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE, resulting in the fourth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


With most of the selling concentrated in commodity stocks, Nasdaq breadth wasn't terrible, with losers beating winners by just over 2-to-1. It was worse on the NYSE, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by nearly 4-to-1.


The weak action in indexes and leading stocks means that investors should be playing defense at this point. Rather than look for compelling technical setups, or stocks finding support at key levels, focus on your current holdings and get rid of stocks that aren't working. If you're still holding some nice winners, consider taking partial or full profits. There's nothing wrong with getting out of the market's way amid clear-cut signs of distribution.


Indexes may or may not end up testing their mid-June lows, but with the market tide flowing negative at this point, raising cash is sound strategy.


Economic Data
-------------


In economic news, the stock market looked past a big jump in consumer confidence. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index hit 103.2 in August, much higher than the 97.4 consensus.


Meanwhile, a much-higher-than-expected JOLTS report, which tracks the monthly change in job openings, fueled more wage-inflation fears as employers struggle to find workers.


The [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) tool now puts the chances of a 75-basis-point hike at the September meeting at just over 70%.


With the 10-year yield finding a new home above its 50-day moving average, along with broad-based weakness in commodity stocks, the market's message is clear. It's worried about an economic slowdown and its duration.


Oil and gas industry groups were among the day's worst performers. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled at $91.64 a barrel, down 5.5%.

Several top-rated oil and gas producers ended with losses of at least 8%. **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) dived below its 10-day moving average, falling 9.4%. **Antero Resources** ([AR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AR)) slumped below its 21-day line, down 8.1%.


**Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) help up relatively well in the group. After a series of low-volume gains, shares fell 3%. But PXD stock held above its 10-day moving average.


In the coal group, **Arch Resources** ([ARCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCH)) and **Peabody Energy** ([BTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTU)) ended with losses of 10% and 9%, respectively. ARCH gapped down to its 50-day moving average and held support, while BTU pierced its 21-day line.



Among steel producers, [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) fell down to its 21-day line after a short-lived breakout from a cup-with-handle base. STLD cleared the 86.04 buy point last week, but sellers knocked the stock off highs Friday. It's now 5.4% below the buy point.

The FANG trade was back in fashion Wednesday, as the technology heavyweights that have colored much of the stock market were among the most noteworthy movers.




[FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) have been consolidating for months, and Wednesday's moves were an indication they could be reasserting their role as the tip of the technology spear.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — the "G" in FANG as the parent company of Google — broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/). It closed above the 1,843.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume was 115% above its 50-day average. That's an impressive surge, especially for a megacap like Alphabet. Normally, [a 40% rise in volume](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-apple-nvidia-breakouts-still-worked-despite-light-volume/) is considered to be solid for any breakout.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rallied 4.6% and climbed back above its 50-day moving average. It continued work on a base. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rose 2.4% and is rebounding off the lows of a 21-week-old base.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP012021-216x300.jpg)Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) gapped up and topped its 575.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume after the video streaming company [gave a bullish fourth-quarter report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-improved-finances-possible-share-buybacks/). Many analysts raised their price targets on Netflix or even upgraded the stock to buy ratings.


"The company was able to cross the 200 (million) global member threshold despite the launch of numerous well-funded competitors," Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a report. Price hikes in some markets should be absorbed with minimal churn, and Netflix's original content and improving cash flow bode well, the analysts added.


Apple, Microsoft Also Climb
---------------------------


Many investors also consider **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) as logical extensions of the FANG stocks. The stock market's two largest stocks by market cap also performed well Wednesday.


Apple reclaimed its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and continues work on a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Microsoft (which, like Apple, also holds a spot in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard)) appeared to awaken from a long slumber with a rally of nearly 4%.


With the largest techs rallying, the Nasdaq composite jumped 2% to a record high and was able to offset a weak day for semiconductors.


The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8%. Both indexes pulled back modestly to their 21-day lines last week and now have found support at that level. The 21-day line offered support to both indexes multiple times after the November lows. The Nasdaq didn't quite fall to its 21-day line last week.


In another bullish sign, Wednesday's gains were enough to scrub off a series of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The Nasdaq's three distribution days (Dec. 23, Jan. 4, Jan. 6) all came off simultaneously because the composite climbed more than 5% from those sessions' closing prices. The S&P 500's Dec. 14 distribution day was erased in the same fashion.


That leaves [four distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500, which is more reflective of the stock market's uptrend. A normal pullback to make sure the market doesn't get too high seems like the most immediate risk.


The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed on Wednesday with a 0.4% increase. Indeed, the day belonged to large caps. The iShares S&P 100 ETF ([OEF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OEF)) climbed 1.8%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and declined in the NYSE.


FANG Stocks Held Back For Part Of 2020
--------------------------------------


To be sure, the stock market didn't exactly need the FANG stocks to make solid gains in November and December. While FANG stocks consolidated, the stock market found other leaders to take it higher. Other leaders emerged, including some pandemic plays and semiconductors.


Financials were the only S&P sector to fall. Select Sector Financial SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) eased 0.4%. Bank earnings haven't wowed the market, and the trend continued with **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)). The stock reversed modestly lower despite news that [fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/morgan-stanley-stock-morgan-stanley-earnings-q4-2020/).


At noon ET, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president, and the change in the nation's leadership was swift as Biden prepared to unleash a series of executive orders.


While Wall Street doesn't expect Biden to necessarily be an ally, it has not acted like it's a negative either. From the close at 3369 on the Nov. 3 Election Day until Wednesday's inauguration, the S&P 500 surged 14.3%, a record for that postelection period, says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial.

The stock market ended Thursday with modest gains and virtually at session highs. Plus the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit record highs. Amid the session's positive action, tech titans **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are in or near new buy zones.




Overall, the stock market was uplifted by a third straight week of declining jobless claims. Initial jobless claims [fell to a seasonally adjusted 375,000](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) in the week ended Aug. 7, the Labor Department said Thursday, down from a revised 387,000 in the prior week. Meanwhile, U.S. producer-level prices rose 1% in July, above economist forecasts for a 0.6% increase. On a year-over-year basis, prices soared 7.8% vs. projections for a 7.3% gain.


The Nasdaq closed almost 0.4% higher, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher after spending most of the day in the red. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.3%.


Leading growth stocks showed moderate gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 0.6% Thursday. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) advanced 4%, adding to Wednesday's 26% surge and moving further up the [right side of a cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). The [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is 191.99.


Volume inched higher on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP081221](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP081221-276x300.jpg)The Nasdaq snapped a two-day losing streak Thursday and remains just off record highs following this week's modest losses. The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 hit record highs Thursday.


The market's [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count is starting to improve. On Tuesday and again Thursday, a distribution day on the S&P 500 dropped off the count due to time, while the Nasdaq lost a stalling session on Wednesday due to time. This indicates that some institutional selling is starting to age out, offering investors another reason to be more confident.


The S&P 500's count dropped to five distribution days, while the Nasdaq is at four.


The market trend remains in a confirmed uptrend and leading growth stocks are mostly acting well. Investors should still be on the hunt for top stocks breaking out past new buy points. Earnings season can still create winners and losers.


For example, [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/videos/unity-software-breaks-out-after-earnings/) Tuesday fueled **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) past a 115.60 buy point in a cup base. Shares are extended following Thursday's 5% advance.

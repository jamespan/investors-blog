The major stock indexes ended higher Thursday, as the stock market closed out 2020 on a positive note. The Nasdaq logged its best year since 2009 after a stunning comeback amid the coronavirus pandemic. Tech giants Apple and Tesla were huge 2020 stars.




The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 eased 0.3%. The S&P 500 moved up 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.65%.


Inside the [Dow 30](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the No. 1-performing stock in 2020 with a scorching 80.8% return. Apple stock broke out above a 72.16 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) in April and is now trying to clear a 138.08 cup-base entry.


Meanwhile, leading growth stocks lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 0.3% on Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 17-ranked **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) surged 7.65% as it moves up the right side of a short cup base with a 51.20 buy point. Shares found much needed support around their 50-day line.


Volume was lower compared with Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume.


Nasdaq Has Best Year Since 2009
-------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP_123120-265x300.jpg)Despite positive action across the indexes as they closed at session highs, a number of top growth stocks were big losers. **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) tumbled more than 6% to its lowest level since Dec. 2. **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) slid 2.7% and 3.2%, respectively, as they test their recent buy points.


Heading into 2021, the stock market remains in a strong uptrend. (*Be sure to check out [IBD's 2021 Stock Market Forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-2021-could-be-bumpier-than-you-think/).)* There are four distribution days on the S&P 500 and just two on the Nasdaq. Investors should still feel confident buying strong breakouts.


Be mindful about locking in gains on the upside. Investors should take at least some profits when a stock rises 20%-25% from its buy point. However, if the stock rises 20% in three weeks or less, then you have the ability to hold the stock for a full eight weeks. Such powerful moves indicate that an institutional-quality stock could be a big winner.


2020 is a key example of the importance of tuning out the daily news to focus on the price and volume action of the stock indexes and top growth stocks. Despite the coronavirus pandemic — which caused lockdowns and massive unemployment — the Nasdaq composite advanced 43.6%, its best year since 2009 when it surged 43.9% in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The S&P 500 turned in a 16.3% gain, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with a milder 7.2% rise.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a star of 2020, surging 743% for the year. The stock showed multiple buy points during the year, including a 174.06 cup-with-handle entry and a 466 buy point in another [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). The stock ended the year at record highs.

Stocks To Watch: Amazon, Netflix
--------------------------------


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) are finally seeing a resurgence in recent trading sessions after taking significant breaks.


Amazon reached its peak on Sept. 2. Shares are tracing a choppy base with a 3,552.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). Meanwhile, an early entry looms at 3,496.34. Amazon stock fell 0.9% Thursday.


Meanwhile, Netflix is breaking out past a 536.47 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Shares ended in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) that tops out at 563.29.


Netflix last peaked on July 13, and has been in a choppy consolidation period ever since, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


Both stocks have weak [RS lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/), which are real flaws that could potentially doom breakouts. Investors should typically be focusing on RS lines at new highs. For example, the RS line for **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) hit a new high on the Dec. 22 breakout past a 792.64 entry.

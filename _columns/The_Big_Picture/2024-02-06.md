The stock market didn't move much Tuesday, with major stock indexes ending with modest gains, as Wall Street weighed another round of strong earnings reports from **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) and **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)).




Earnings winners after the close included **Elf Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Azek** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)).


Palantir and Toyota ended with gains of 31% and 8%, respectively. Palantir spiked on strong [full-year revenue guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-earnings-ai-news-q42023/), while Toyota gave a rosy [earnings outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/ford-earnings-q4-2023-ford-stock-toyota-stock-record-profits/). But LLY stock reversed slightly lower despite news that revenue for its new [weight-loss drug Zepbound](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-eli-lilly-earnings-q4-2023/) came in at $175.8 million, well above the $75 million consensus estimate.


The Russell 2000 rallied just over 0.8% and reclaimed its 50-day moving average. A bounce off the support level last week was a good sign for stock market bulls, but support gave way two days later.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 0.4%, helped by strong gains for **Walgreens** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), which alone added 19 points to the Dow. Disney is still in the 5% buy zone after topping a 96.51 entry on Jan. 29.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite held up well, rising less than 0.1%, despite a 3.6% drop for **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell more than 4% intraday but pared the loss to less than 2%. Winners beat losers on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1. Volume fell slightly from Monday.


The S&P 500 closed higher by less than 0.1%, with advancers beating decliners by more than 2-to-1. Volume rose on the NYSE.

Nvidia has run straight up without much consolidation after a clean breakout from a shallow flat base on Jan. 8. Even with Tuesday's decline, the chip leader is still holding above its 10-day line. AMD has come in a little more and is testing its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Chip-related groups lagged in the stock market Tuesday, with the fabless group down around 2%. The culprit was **Rambus** ([RMBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMBS)), which plunged 19% after the company missed revenue estimates. Adjusted profit increased 48% from a year ago to 37 cents a share. But revenue was flat at $122.2 million and below the $135 million consensus. Results from group peer and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) are due Wednesday after the close.


Sellers Hit Adobe
-----------------


**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) slumped nearly 4% after briefly topping a 633.89 buy point on Jan. 29. ADBE stock offers a good lesson on why it's important to pay attention to the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) when a stock is forming a base. Notice how Adobe's relative strength was lagging when the stock was trying to break out.


With the major stock indexes holding near highs, the confirmed uptrend continues to show signs of strength despite what looks like a lofty distribution-day count for the S&P 500. But of the six days currently in the count, only one day truly had the feeling of institutional selling. That was when the index fell 1.6% in higher volume on Jan. 31. Two other days were [stalling sessions](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) on Jan. 22 and Jan. 24. The three other days showed mild declines.

The Dec. 29 distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the count because enough time has passed to make them no longer relevant.


But just because the indexes are near highs doesn't mean it's easy to find actionable stocks. It was much easier in early November, around the time the Nasdaq and S&P 500 marked [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/).


Patience For Now
----------------


It's slim pickings for now, which is a cue to stay patient and wait for new setups to emerge. That said, a name like online real estate firm **Zillow** ([Z](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Z)) looks interesting as it builds a base while holding support at its 10-week line. A cup-with-handle base could be in place by the end of the week with a 59.40 entry.


**Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)), meanwhile, is also basing nicely above its 10-week line. A flat base shows a 155.84 buy point, but earnings are due Thursday after the close.


The stock market was unfazed by news from the New York Federal Reserve that credit card delinquencies jumped more than 50% last year. Total consumer debt hit $17.5 trillion. Credit card debt that moved into serious delinquency, defined as 90 days or more past due, amounted to 6.4% in Q4. That's up from 4% at the end of 2022.


A slowdown in consumer spending could tilt the economy into a recession, but the Federal Reserve seems to be in the soft-landing camp for now.


The delinquency news comes after Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Wall Street that the first rate cut probably wouldn't come at the March meeting. The Fed is still worried that inflation could stay sticky due to a string of mostly strong economic data reports, including a robust job market. Inflation has come down quite a bit, but the most recent core personal consumption expenditures index came in at 2.9%, above the Fed's target of 2%.

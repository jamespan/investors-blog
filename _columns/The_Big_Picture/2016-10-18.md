The main indexes bounced Tuesday, providing a glimmer of hope for a market that for weeks has had little to cheer.


The S&P 500 added 0.6% but remained stuck in a sideways trend. The Nasdaq rose 0.8% to close a few points below its 50-day moving average. That line has been a barrier for more than a week and still stands as a threat to the composite's ambitions.


Volume rose in the major exchanges, always a good sign when indexes climb. The Sept. 13 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) was deleted because it's become too stale to count any longer. That tilted the price-volume calculus more in favor of the bulls, but not enough to remove lingering doubts about the market's direction.


Indexes still refuse to give up much ground while not rising much either. That dull behavior has created some opportunities in leading stocks that are finding support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).


![mp101816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101816-186x300.png)Check the charts of **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), and **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)).


That helps offset the weak results from breakouts of late. (See **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), **Convergys** ([CVG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVG)).)


One reason the Nasdaq performed better was the great strength in some of its flagship stocks, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped back above a 813.98 buy point from a flat base in fast trading. Netflix soared 19% as it broke out past a 111.95 buy point following a superb earnings report.


Leaders from various districts of the market carried the load on a day when earnings reports sparked traders.


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) vaulted nearly 5% in huge volume, confirming a buy area created by support at the 50-day moving average. The company beat third-quarter sales and profit expectations, backed by a surprisingly strong 13% jump in same-store sales. But it was a rare show of force in the limp restaurants industry group. In fact, Domino's rally did not carry over to the rest of the group, which inched up 0.4% Tuesday.


 **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) carried the flag for financials. It beat Q3 expectations and closed slightly above the 172.52 buy point of a flat base.


The health care sector had a broader rally. Managed care, generic drugs, outpatient care, hospitals, research equipment, services and ethical drugmakers were all in the day's best 25 industry groups (out of 197). Again, it seemed a bullish earnings report ignited interest.


 **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) soared nearly 7% in more than three times average volume after the HMO beat profit expectations and raised its full-year forecast. The nation's largest health insurer also is in the pharmacy benefit management business and other medical areas, which make it somewhat of an industry bellwether.


Biotechs also rose but not as much. Most big gains in the group were among the low-priced and less-liquid stocks. The big caps were mostly higher but mostly quiet. **Medicines Co.** ([MDCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDCO)) gapped up and was an exception. The company had encouraging trials on a cholesterol-lowering drug.


The medical research equipment rose 1.5% but regained only a fraction of last week's 8.3% slide. **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) found support at the 50-day line. Both are part of the IBD 50, which rose 0.7%.

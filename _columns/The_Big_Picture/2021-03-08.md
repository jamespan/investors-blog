Stock Market Fades, Unable To Sustain Friday's Bullish Action; This Sector Index Gets Trampled
===============================================================================================

Stocks faded badly Monday, throwing a wet blanket on Friday's bullish reversals.




Indexes were mixed for much of the day, until afternoon selling showed the stock market's true direction.


The Nasdaq composite tried holding gains for the first couple of hours, then started descending the same way it has multiple times over the past two weeks. The composite closed 2.4% lower and at session lows.


Friday's positive reversal offered hope of a bottom in the stock market. The Nasdaq fought back from a 2.6% loss to close 1.5% higher that day. But the bullish momentum did not carry over into Monday. In fact, a late-fading market is indicative of underlying weakness.

The S&P 500 also didn't get much follow-through from Friday. The index reversed lower to close with a 0.5% loss. It ended both below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and the 50-day line.


Stock Market Rally Attempt Still Alive
--------------------------------------


While dispirited, Monday's session was not a waste. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue working on a rally attempt, as long as they hold above Friday's lows. That means the market could still make [a turn for the better](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) in as little as a few days.


But the stock market is fighting a potent foe in the bond market. Yields continued to climb Monday.


Over the weekend, the Senate passed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that stimulated bond sellers. The bill — which still needs final approval in the House before President Biden signs it — added to the notion that the U.S. economy is heating up.


That affects the stock market in several ways, including higher borrowing costs. Also, as yields climb, bonds become more attractive and stocks lose appeal as the most attractive asset.


Tradeweb says the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond's 10-year yield is at its highest closing point since mid-February 2020, and the 20-year and 30-year yields are around their highest closing points since the 20-year was reissued in the middle of May 2020 and for the 30-year since the beginning of 2020.


Bond, Commodity Markets Exert Influence
---------------------------------------


Shifts in bond, commodity and other financial markets have combined for a bifurcated stock market.


Growth and technology are both clearly out of favor. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) is down 3.7% this month. By comparison, the S&P materials sector is up 3.8%, industrials up 4.2% and transportation up 5%.


The energy sector is beating them all, up more than 10% after February's 22.5% surge. The price of U.S. crude is trending toward $70 a barrel after spending most of the coronavirus crisis under $45. Financials are up 5.7% thanks mainly to rising interest rates.


The S&P 500 has performed relatively better because it is more heavily weighted with cyclicals and financials than the Nasdaq.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1% and made a record high Monday. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) led the Dow. It gapped up to a new high after California officials signaled that the company's [Disneyland and California Adventure parks could reopen on a limited basis](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-near-all-time-high-as-lagging-unit-gets-big-boost/) on April 1.


The Russell 2000 rose 0.5% Monday. The small-cap index is most heavily weighted in health care (19%), industrials (16%) and financials (nearly 16%). Opportunities are arising in cyclicals. On Monday, for instance, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) added fertilizer company **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) as a half size position. But market risk is still a problem.



The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) slid 3%, as semiconductors weighed. Six of the worst-performing stocks on the IBD 50 were chip companies, all down more than 4.5%. Other techs were in the bottom of the list, too. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index plunged 5.4%, a big factor in the Nasdaq's bad day.

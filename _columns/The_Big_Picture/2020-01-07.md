The stock market closed modestly lower after a session in which indexes could not settle on a clear direction. But while indexes did not impress, some leading technology stocks outperformed.




Indexes shifted direction several times and slid in the final half-hour. The Nasdaq composite teased a new high but lost a minor gain in that late drop. It closed a fraction lower.


The S&P 500 fell 0.3% after it also could not make up its mind which way to go. Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq, supporting the notion that the market could not commit itself to buy or sell.


An indecisive day like Tuesday is not necessarily bad. The stock market has some serious risks to weigh, including the U.S.-Iran crisis, a jobs report due Friday and the start of another earnings season.

[Distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains light. A market pullback would not be surprising at this stage, so some caution is needed just to keep investors from overreaching.


Leading stocks are largely upright, which is perhaps the best indication that the stock market is not in imminent danger. The IBD 50 eased less than 0.1% and is up 2% in the early days of the new year, beating the S&P 500 (up 0.2% for January) and the Nasdaq (up 1.1%).


Stock Market Finds Interest In CES
----------------------------------


With the CES technology show in Las Vegas in full swing, some key companies announced new products. That created some news to keep growth investors interested â€” and stocks moving. The semiconductor sector was one of the day's brightest.


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) announced new chips and was up 2% but faded later in the day to close slightly lower. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) shares rose more than 1% and are forming a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) rose nearly 3% after [a series of product announcements](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/ces-2020-qualcomm-chips-to-power-first-5g-pc/).


**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) rose past the 77.77 buy point of a [base on base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/). Volume was heavy for the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.


**Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) jumped to a new high after it raised its December-quarter revenue outlook for a second time in one month. KeyCorp and SunTrust Banks raised their price targets on the stock.


There was some cheer in software leaders, too.


**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) followed through on its breakout past a 166.44 buy point. **Akamai** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) surged and grew closer to the 93.22 buy point of a new base.


**RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) rose above the 178.09 buy point of a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/), but dipped below the entry. Volume was well below normal levels, which was another problem for the breakout.


In health care, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) broke out past the 232.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a short base. Volume was 25% above average, which was less than desired for a breakout.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4% after a day of narrow price movement. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was the Dow's best component, up 1.1% after rumors that Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) [is buying Boeing shares](https://www.investors.com/news/warren-buffett-rumor-berkshire-hathaway-buying-boeing-stock/).

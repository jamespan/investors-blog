  Stocks Add To Market's Misery As Nasdaq Composite Breaches This Key Level

The Nasdaq composite fell below another critical level Tuesday, causing a deeper fissure on the stock market's landscape.




The Nasdaq slid below its Oct. 29 low and closed sightly below it. After Tuesday's 1.7% tumble, the composite wiped out all gains from its prior rally attempt. That renders the market's rally officially dead, and forces a downgrade in IBD's market outlook to market in correction.


Investors should reduce exposure to stocks, if they haven't already. Taking some remaining profits is one way to do that, and any new stock purchases should be avoided. Immediately sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price.


Indexes opened sharply lower Tuesday then pared gains into midday. But this is a market that refuses to get off the couch, and indexes faded the remainder of the session.

No matter, both indexes were left with losses for the year, and the Nasdaq with a minuscule gain. All three are below their long-term 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 lost 1.8% and the Dow 2.2%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, indicating intense selling at institutional trading desks. NYSE volume was indicated lower.


Losing stocks led advancers by a more than 5-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Nearly all 197 industry groups fell.


It's been hard to motivate this market. Indexes flashed a bottoming signal with a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on Nov. 7, in the wake of the midterm elections. But the market made absolutely no progress from that day.


The Nasdaq and Dow first fell below the 50-day averages, then all three indexes went below the 200-day lines. With those key levels violated, it just got harder for the market to find a footing.


[Distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) soon after the follow-through was a bad sign. Also, the sharp break below the Nasdaq's 50-day line in early October echoed other times when follow-throughs failed. In those instances, it took the market a couple or a few tries to get an uptrend marching.


Buying on dips has not worked like it has before. The Nasdaq rose from support at the 50-day line several times in the summer and spring, but not since it breached the line in early October.


The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) signaled many market lows when it hit elevated levels. But since October, four spikes in the ratio failed to solidify market rebounds.


Surges in the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, also did not lead to lasting rallies. There was another such signal Tuesday.


Much of today's angst is in the major techs, which carried the market for much of this year.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gapped down to its lowest price since early May after Goldman Sachs [raised doubts about iPhone demand](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-goldman-sachs-cut/). Goldman cut its price target on Apple to 182 from 209.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) slid below its 200-day line in active trading. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) remain deep in corrections. But at least Tuesday they pared most losses or even reversed slightly higher.


The IBD 50 fell 1.9% as 21 of its components fell more than 2% and as much as 9% (**Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE))). A handful of health care leaders rose or fell modestly.


Retail stocks were off sharply after some major companies tumbled after reporting earnings. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) plummeted below its 200-day line in heavy volume after [Q3 results missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-target-stock-kohls-earnings-kohls-stock/). **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) also plunged in big volume despite results that beat views.


Energy shares resumed their descent after [crude oil prices fell](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/oil-markets-opec-crude-supply-in-focus.html) nearly 7% to $53.39 a barrel. Oil remained in a bear market.

Major Indexes Take A Break In Lighter Trade, But Some Medicals Shoot Higher
============================================================================

Stocks staged mostly mild declines Monday, but the drowsy action masked some excellent upside action amid a few names in one of the largest and most important sectors of the market -- namely, the medicals.


The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, giving back half of Friday's 0.6% advance. The Nasdaq also was in a miserly mood following its solid start to the new quarter. The tech-heavy composite index's 0.5% decline on Monday follows a 0.9% gain on Friday.


![MP040416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP040416-1-177x300.jpg)Small caps were less fortunate. The S&P SmallCap 600 slid 1.1%. Yet even after that drop, the index remains on the north side of its 200-day moving average.


Last month was significant in that regard; the Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in shattering through resistance at that key technical gauge. Plus, the midterm 50-day moving average lines have curled higher in recent weeks (see the big charts on page B2 of the print edition). They confirm the general uptrend in stocks over the past 10 weeks of trade.


Volume fell on both the Big Board and the Nasdaq, which is ideal for the bulls during a broad decline like the one Monday.


Of course, to be a great stock picker, you have to read between the market's lines -- that is, you must know the sectors that are benefiting from an above-average inflow of institutional players as opposed to the ones that are struggling. And that's why Monday's market action was particularly interesting. Two of the day's top performers -- **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) and **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) -- come from the medical sector, which has dropped to a lowly 29th out of 33 sectors as ranked in Monday's IBD.


Biotechs were the darlings of fund managers until 2015, when harsh criticism on Capitol Hill over high drug prices punctured the bubble. But medical equipment firms have not fallen as hard. Edwards Lifesciences, a member of IBD's Leaderboard since Feb. 23, blasted more than 16% higher in easily the highest turnover so far this year. The expert in cardiovascular treatments announced strong results regarding its catheter-based heart valve products. The move sent Edwards more than 25% above a recent base breakout past 83.53.


Intuitive gained more than 2% to an all-time high. A Jan. 13 breakout past a 556.70 double-bottom-with-handle buy point failed, but some stocks come back even stronger. That was exactly what happened with Intuitive, which continues to be No. 1 in the global market for robotic surgical systems. Earnings per share grew 23%, 34% and 20% vs. year-earlier levels in the past three quarters. Those are enviable increases for any big-cap firm. The Street sees Intuitive's earnings rising 21% in Q1, partially benefiting from an easy year-ago comparison.


Stock picking is still challenging. While Edwards, Intuitive and a few other medical stocks are up since Jan. 1, the popular SPDR Health Care ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) ETF is down 3.7%, even after Monday's rousing 1.2% rally.


IBD's Mutual Fund index (also on page B2) continues to lag the mild year-to-date gain of the S&P 500. Near-zero interest rates are one factor. With economic data continuing to be mildly positive, the Federal Reserve appears likely to stay "accommodative" for most of this year. The beneficiaries? Utilities, telecoms and other companies that must borrow heavily to operate. SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) finished Monday down 0.4%, but it's still up 14.5% year-to-date.

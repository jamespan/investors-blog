===============================================

Stocks kept a grip on gains Friday as the indexes made up for the previous session's givebacks. The Nasdaq opened 1.2% higher and then rose to finish up 1.5% for the day. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each added 1.2%.

  

The IBD 50 sprinted 1.8%, leading the indexes for a second straight session.

  

Volume in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) fell on both major exchanges.

  

The S&P 500 retook its 200-day moving average, but both the S&P and the Nasdaq remain under their 50-day moving average lines.

  

The technical picture for the market improved because the June 4 distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 expired because of time. This leaves the indexes with a more normal count. (See the Market Pulse at right.) However, the count is still a threat, especially since there are no old distribution days due to expire soon.

  

While a condition of "uptrend under pressure" is still an uptrend, lately the pressure has been easier to see than the uptrend.

  

Breakouts look good as they occur but then they fizzle, sometimes on the same day. Outright failures (falls of 7% to 8% below the buy point) have been rare, but most stocks are having trouble getting above and staying above the 5% buy zone.

  

On Friday, retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) climbed above the buy point, a day after the stock cleared a flat base intraday but closed under the entry.

  

Staffing firm **On Assignment** ([ASGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASGN)) also retook a buy point. Volume, though, was only 9% above average. Also, the chart pattern is chaotic-looking.

  

Petroleum refiner **Tesoro** ([TSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSO)) delivered a classic-looking breakout. A high close in a long price bar, as the stock gained 5% in volume 84% above average, showed strength. Tesoro, though, has spotty fundamentals.

  

Drugstore chain **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) cleared a cup-without-handle pattern in the morning but closed slightly under the buy point. Volume was more than twice its usual pace.

  

The flip side to this picture is that the market has had to deal with some ugly news lately and has handled it relatively well.

  

China stunned investors during the week as it decided that a declining market is something that should be handled with coercion: Selling was banned for major shareholders; brokerages were loaned money and told to buy stocks; and short sellers were demonized in the state media.

  

A representative of China's regulatory commission called the sell-off "irrational."Meanwhile, Greece spent the week fighting any notion that debts are meant to be paid. However, near the end of the week, optimism grew that Greece might reach a deal with its creditors.

  

A weaker U.S. market might have caved on the week's news from China and Greece. But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended the week 2% to 3% off recent highs.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 inched down 0.1%. The Nasdaq trimmed 0.2%, while the S&P 500 was flat.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%, helped by a 2% gain for **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and 3% weekly gains for **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)).

  

Earnings season shifts into a higher gear in the coming week.

  

Companies reporting include: **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), rail operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)).

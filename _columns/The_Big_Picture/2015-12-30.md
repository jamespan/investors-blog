Selling intensified in the last half hour of trading Wednesday as stocks held to a familiar path, following the lead of oil, which came under renewed pressure.


The Nasdaq gave back more than half of Tuesday's nice gain but held above its 50-day moving average, falling 0.8%. The S&P 500 and the Dow lost 0.7% each. Volume on the NYSE and the Nasdaq fell from Tuesday's levels.

Meanwhile, CNN reported that President Obama was recently briefed about possible attacks in New York, Los Angeles and Washington between the Christmas and New Year's holidays, but the threat was uncorroborated.


WTI crude oil futures for February delivery lost $1.27, or 3.4%, to settle at $36.60 a barrel after weekly supply data showed an unexpected build in inventories.


The IBD 50 fell 0.6% despite a strong showing from **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), which rose 7%. The maker of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) chips received a boost from an Electronic Times article reporting that **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) would begin using the company's screens in its iPhones.


A Dec. 2 breakout for Universal Display was short-lived. A weak market had a lot to do with its brevity. The stock didn't take long to firm up; on Wednesday, it reclaimed a 55.93 buy point. It's still well within buying range, but growth investors know that buying technical breakouts is a tough game at the moment.


When do technical breakouts have the best chance of succeeding? When the market gets wiped clean of sellers and new institutional money starts rolling in from the sidelines.


The number of bullish stock charts out there among institutional-quality names has to be encouraging the bulls. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) scored new highs Tuesday, and many others could be revving their engines for more upside. But they won't move meaningfully higher without the buying power of institutions, which have been mostly sitting on the sidelines in recent weeks.


Nearly seven years into the bull market that started in March 2009, the bears believe that the bull market is long in the tooth and poised for a sharp pullback, especially amid the prospects for higher interest rates.


Let the market decide who is right. Let the action in leading growth stocks serve as your best barometer.


For now, few top market leaders are showing signs of wear and tear.

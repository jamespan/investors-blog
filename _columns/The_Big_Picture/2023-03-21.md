A big rally in financial stocks in the stock market Tuesday fueled a day of outperformance for the Russell 2000 small-cap index as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway. Financial services is the third highest-weighted sector in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) at nearly 15%, helping fuel a 1.9% gain for small caps.




The Nasdaq composite also had a good day on the seventh day of its rally attempt, rising 1.6% in lower volume.


Positive sentiment was fueled by comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said the government would be willing to take further action to protect deposits.


**Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) and **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100. Both stocks are strong from a fundamental and technical perspective. BKNG soared above the 2,500 level as it forms a big cup-with-handle base. MELI moved above its 10-day moving average as the stock approaches an alternate entry of 1,273.96.


Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1.

Tuesday's stock market rally came as [federal funds futures traders](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-federal-reserve-is-likely-to-hike-but-a-u-turn-is-near-sp-500-gains/) grow more confident about a quarter-point hike by the Federal Reserve Wednesday. As of the market close, traders were leaning toward another quarter-point hike in May, with a Fed pivot coming as early as the June meeting.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) was the star of the day in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), up more than 25%, after the footwear maker reported another quarter of blistering revenue growth. ONON stock gapped out of a cup-with-handle base with a 24.21 buy point. Tight, sideways action from here would be a sign of strength and could usher in a new entry.



Leaderboard is lightly invested ahead of Wednesday's policy statement. But the action in individual growth stocks has improved quite a bit. So there should be ample opportunity to increase exposure, especially if market conditions continue to improve. Until the market proves itself more, exposure should be kept between 0% and 20%.


In the chip-equipment group, **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)) gapped up and rose 15%. It's still in a seven-week consolidation after a volatile week of trading during the week ended March 3. But that week ended up being a support week with a solid close in the upper half of its weekly range.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) jumped 6.3% in light turnover. After a low-volume pullback close to its 50-day line, DKNG is still on breakout watch as it sits below a 21.72 entry.


Enterprise software firm **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)) gained 3.4%, also in light volume. It's near the top of a shallow consolidation with a 48.55 buy point.


The IBD 50 index climbed 1.4% Tuesday.

  As Stocks Pause, Leading Stocks Are Providing A Hopeful Signal

Stocks closed little changed Monday, but leading stocks continued to outperform — a good sign for a market uptrend that is moderating.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 each climbed 0.1% to cap a trendless session. The [Dow Jones industrial average](http://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-and-dow-stocks-news-and-analysis) fell 0.2%, sticking above the 25,000 level.


Indexes closed near session lows, and volume fell from Friday's levels, befitting of the lazy action in the indexes Monday. Still, the Dow Jones transportation average climbed almost 1.3% thanks mainly to airfreight, airline and shipping stocks. Chips were another pocket of strength, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index up 0.5%.


A week ago, investors may have wondered if the major indexes would pause to consolidate big gains as they approached some key resistance levels. Indeed, just as the S&P 500 came close to crossing its 200-day moving average, indexes started to weaken.

Meanwhile, the Market Pulse shows there's still little [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and leading stocks are generally doing well.


The Nasdaq Composite Today
--------------------------


The Nasdaq remains in a solid upward price channel traced to its late-December low, and the S&P 500 has barely poked below its price channel. Those trends are basically intact. The 50-day moving averages of both indexes are starting to turn upward.


The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the two indexes were B- after Friday, which investors can consider a good grade.


More important is the fact that leading stocks are outperforming while the market pauses. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.3%, marking the fourth straight day that the IBD 50 has outperformed the market. That suggests institutional investors are using the market pause to add to their favorites. It also reinforces the notion that institutions are quietly content with their current stock positions.


At about 17% below its prior high, the IBD 50 lags the main indexes, which are no more than 10% from past highs. Yet there's an excellent mix of stocks from multiple sectors in the IBD 50.


**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), despite falling Monday, is doing its part in the blossoming rally among software sector stocks. Fellow IBD 50 firm **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)), also part of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), is clearly a new winner in a recovering chip sector. Also count **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) as a true leader in the health care area and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) among the consumer-spending-related stock leaders.


Small caps also outperformed Monday, providing another encouraging data point. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.8%.


Two Potential Disruptions
-------------------------


Two factors on the immediate horizon could upset the balance of bulls and bears. A Friday deadline looms for talks on border security, and there could be another government shutdown without an accord. President Donald Trump suffered a political blow last time the government shut down, and it's hard to image he would risk another political defeat.


Trade talks with China are approaching a March 1 deadline, although there are signs it could be extended. Of course, progress on either front would bring relief to Wall Street.


Earnings remain important and the principal mover of individual stocks. With two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies' earnings already reported, the index is heading for a fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. FactSet estimates a 13.3% increase in fourth-quarter EPS on a blended basis.


But for the current quarter, the outlook is dimming. "Analysts expect a decline in earnings in Q1 2019 and low, single-digit growth in earnings in Q2 2019 and Q3 2019," FactSet noted in a report. For Q1, analysts are projecting a 1.7% decline in earnings from the year-ago period and revenue growth of 5.4%.


FactSet also found a big difference in the fourth quarter for companies that do a lot of business abroad vs. those with domestic operations. For companies with more than 50% of sales domestically, the blended earnings growth rate was 16.6% and sales growth 7.2%.


Two take-aways from these observations? One, the impact of the U.S. tax cut on corporations is fading, as was expected. Two, Europe and other foreign markets are still lagging the U.S. economy.

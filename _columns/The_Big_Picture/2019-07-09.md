Daft start, deft finish. In a confirmed market uptrend, both the major indexes and leading growth stocks tend to behave this way. And Tuesday's action painted such a scene.




The Nasdaq composite, fresh from logging its [third distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on Monday, turned an early loss of almost 0.5% into a 0.5% gain by day's end. Strength in fiber optic equipment, fabless semiconductor and enterprise software firms led the upside. The Nasdaq 100 also advanced 0.5%. Like the Nasdaq composite, it recouped nearly two-thirds of the prior session's losses.


A similar reversal by the S&P 500 was not as dramatic. Yet it retained an equally bullish tone. The large-cap benchmark erased a 0.4% drop in the opening minutes with a late-hour push higher and ended up 0.1%.


That marked a sixth rise in the past eight sessions.

CLOSE




Monday's decline hinted at a recalibration in exposure to so-called risk assets by large investors as the probability of a half-point cut in short-term interest rates later this month dimmed. Meanwhile, the market will be assessing the prospects for progress or failure in U.S.-China trade talks and the upcoming wave of quarterly results in coming weeks. Yet for now, the market bulls remain in control.


The S&P SmallCap 600 finished lower, but shaved its loss to nary 0.2%. Notice on a daily chart how the index has refused to dive beneath its converging 50-day and 200-day moving averages lately.


Volume was flat vs. the prior session on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq.


Beyond Growth Stocks: One Healthy Sign Of A Confirmed Uptrend
-------------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MP070919-236x300.jpg)When a market is in a confirmed uptrend, observe this positive technical sign: Key equity indexes should rise above their 50-day moving averages and lead their 50-day lines higher.


The S&P 500 daily chart offers a solid case study in recent months.


Did you read the [June 7 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/), which pinpointed a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) by the Nasdaq composite? The follow-through offers a super-timely signal that a significant price correction may be over and true market leaders may be ready to shine.


On that session, the S&P 500 closed above its 50-day line for the first time in nearly three weeks. Since that day's close, the index has rallied 4.3%. Lately, it's been knocking on the door of its first daily session close above 3000. Meanwhile, it's tugged the 50-day moving average higher.


The Nasdaq is also trading above its 50-day moving average. The 50-day line has also sloped higher, albeit in light fashion.


Healthy Sign No. 2
------------------


Meanwhile, an improved Accumulation/Distribution Rating for both the Nasdaq (a C+ according to the General Market Indicators page in Monday's Big Picture, up from an E on June 7) and the S&P 500 (C from an E) offers a second reason to believe the new rally has some legs. A rise in this rating indicates that the market is showing heavier turnover on up days and lower volume on the down days.


Since June 7, the Nasdaq has seen just one drop in above-average trade: the June 21 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). The Nasdaq fell a little more than 0.2%.


Distribution days expire on the accompanying Market Pulse either on time (25 trading days after the actual sell-off) or on a strong advance.


Healthy Signs Three And Four
----------------------------


Keep an eye on the Market Pulse and the distribution-day count. The market can sustain a handful of true institutional sell-offs here and there and still rise. But four or five serious distribution days or more can harm the rally.


If you are new to investing in high-octane equities, you want to make sure the stock market is on your side. So in addition to the general action of the indexes, get a good sense of what the best growth stocks are doing.


On Tuesday, they did pretty well.


[In Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), at least six companies gained 1% or more. They don't hail from just one sector, either. The Leaders represent innovation and big growth in the fields of restaurants, human capital management software, e-commerce in China and in Latin America, and chip design.


In other words, they easily outperformed the Nasdaq composite, the best performer among major indexes Tuesday.


The [Sector Leaders list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) has shown decent growth too. At the recent June 3 near-term market bottom, five companies made the list. As of Monday's close, the list has doubled in size.


TheÂ [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), meanwhile, is showing a liking among institutional investors of companies positioned to benefit from growth in consumer spending. Headed into Tuesday's session, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) secured spots No. 10, 11 and 13.


For time-starved IBD readers, simply seeing the stocks making the "Leaders Up In Volume" section of the Market Pulse can help you form a watch list and spot new breakouts. And the daily change of the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gives you instant feedback on how highly rated growth stocks are doing. On Tuesday, The IBD 50 ETF ramped up 0.7%, expanding its year-to-date rally to more than 27%.

============================================================

Stocks jogged to nice gains Friday, but volume declined from the previous session's hot pace.


The Nasdaq advanced 1.3%, while the S&P 500 added 1.1%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 tacking on 0.7%.


The IBD 50 rose 0.9%.


Volume was lower on both major exchanges.


The March 26 distribution day on the S&P 500 fell off the count because of time, leaving the major indexes with six distribution days each.


The indexes have been shedding distribution days that are too old to be relevant to the current market, but they're adding fresh ones almost as quickly. Five weeks ago, the count was seven distribution days apiece, so the market's tone hasn't changed much.


The heavy, unchanging load of distribution points to steady selling among institutions. Until that trend reverses, growth investors will have trouble making much money.


Small cap **Cooper Tire & Rubber** ([CTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTB)) joined the week's gap-down parade with a 13% loss in huge volume. The tire maker's industry group was a strong No. 33 of 197 industry groups going into Friday's session, but that was no help to Cooper Tire.


Cooper's [quarterly results missed](http://news.investors.com/050115-750590-cooper-tire-rubber-hurt-by-china-sale.htm) on earnings and on revenue. The stock began the day with a 90 Composite Rating.


During the week, gap downs included big caps **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and midcap **Harman International** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)).


Still, a number of leaders are posting new highs or making strong moves despite the pressured market.


Leaders notching new highs in strong volume Friday included small caps **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) and **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)); midcap **JetBlue Airways** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)); and **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)), which straddles the line between midcap and big cap.


**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) didn't make a new high, but the big-cap stock did bounce off its 50-day line in strong volume. The company reported a sturdy fiscal Q2, topping views on earnings and sales.


For the week, the IBD 50 lost 4.1%; the small-cap Russell 2000, 3.7%; the Nasdaq, 1.7%; and the S&P 500, 0.4%.


Companies reporting quarterly results in the coming week include **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)), **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)).

A wave of selling hit the stock market Wednesday, resulting in fresh distribution days for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite.




After falling 2.8% intraday, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fought back to nearly break-even, but sellers came into the market late, knocking IWM lower by 1.8%. Not much technical damage was done, though, as IWM closed just above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), a level where it found support earlier this month.


The Nasdaq composite gapped down and lost 2.6%. It also rallied off lows earlier in the session and made a solid test of its 10-day moving average. But the index also faded late, closing just above its 21-day line. The [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has been a support level for the Nasdaq since the index's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/) in early November.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average held above the 30,000 level, but the blue-chip index slumped 2% and closed just above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The S&P 500 fell 2.6%, closing a bit more than 1% above its 50-day line.


Strong earnings reports don't mean much in a wobbly market, and that was the case with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which reported accelerating quarterly earnings and sales growth and strong momentum in its cloud business. But a 3.5% intraday gain faded to 0.2% by the close.


Stock Market Volume
-------------------


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose sharply from Tuesday. The Dec. 18 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 fell off the count because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant. That's why the count for the 500 remains at five on Wednesday. Due to strong gains last week, the Nasdaq had wiped its slate clean ahead of Wednesday's sell-off.


[The CBOE volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) soared above its 200-day moving average and its recent high of 31.46. Just after the close, the VIX was trading around 37.21, up nearly 62%.


After-Hours Earnings
--------------------


The stock market didn't get much relief in after-hours trading as Wall Street weighed earnings reports from **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Tesla, ServiceNow and Apple are [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks.


After falling 2.8% during the regular session, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fell another 0.5% in after-hours trading, partially hurt by a 2% decline in Tesla stock. Facebook turned higher in late trading after initially falling hard on earnings.



ServiceNow was a bright spot, up nearly 2%. The enterprise software leader fell below its 50-day moving average in higher volume during the regular session as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


Apple slumped 3% despite reporting double-digit revenue gains in every product category.


Fed Meeting
-----------


The conclusion of the [two-day Federal Reserve meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-no-drama-fed-meeting-2021-dow-jones/) and accompanying statement didn't move markets much. The 10-year Treasury bond's yield eased 3 basis points to 1.01% as the Fed left its key lending rate unchanged and kept its monthly bond purchases steady at $120 billion. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that the U.S. economy is still a long way from a full recovery.


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment remains at extreme levels according to the [latest survey of stock market newsletter writers by Investor's Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). The bulls rose to 61.2% from 60.4%, marking the ninth straight week of excessively bullish sentiment. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. In other words, extreme bullishness has been seen near several market tops in the past, while extreme bearishness has been seen at market bottoms.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Investor euphoria and excessive speculation continued Wednesday in stocks like **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) (+135%), **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) (+301%), **Express** ([EXPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPR)) (+214%) and **Koss** ([KOSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KOSS)) (+480%). The story used to go that retail investors couldn't move markets because of their lack of buying power. But that's changed now with the emergence of micro-investing apps like Robinhood and Stash. Retail investors might still be buying small, but there are millions of them doing it.


Leading growth stocks got hit hard. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped almost 4.1%, weighed down by weakness in **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) and **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)). **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)), **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) and **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) were bright spots.


Despite the selling, some leading growth stocks made bullish upside reversals. **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) rose 4% after paying another visit to its 50-day moving average. It's forming the right side of a new [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).



Leaderboard stock **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) also reversed sharply higher and hit a new high. The stock faded off highs but still rose 10%. Wednesday's strong gain officially triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/) because the gain from the 33.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) hit 20% in less than three weeks.


In the security software group, **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) reversed higher as it tests support at theÂ [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-rule-is-the-stock-living-beneath-the-10-week-line/). But shares are down 8% so far this week, and the stock is in the bottom half of its weekly trading range. Watch for a weekly close in the upper half of the range.


The same holds true for other leaders in the group like **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).

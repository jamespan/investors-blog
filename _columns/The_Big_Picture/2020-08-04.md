Stock Market Extends Win Streak, As Costco Breaks Out Above New Buy Point; Paycom, Twilio Tumble On Earnings
=============================================================================================================

The stock market ended Tuesday with solid gains and at session highs, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average took the lead in a mostly quiet session. The Nasdaq composite extended a win streak to five sessions.




The Nasdaq moved up 0.4%, while the S&P 500 also rose 0.4% after a burst of late-day buying. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.6%, or 164 points. Dow Jones media giant **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) jumped after reporting earnings after the stock market close.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.7% gain. Leading growth stocks also ended higher, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.4%.


Within the IBD 50, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) was the top performer with a 9.5% surge to new highs. On the downside, **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) slid 1.3%. Bullishly, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF is at its highest level since October 2018, indicating strong performance among top growth stocks.


Nasdaq Hits Another Record High
-------------------------------


![MP080420](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP080420-232x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq hit another record high Tuesday, extending a win streak to five sessions. After two straight 1.5% advances, a more quiet day would be considered constructive for the stock market uptrend. During its five-day win streak, the Nasdaq advanced 5.2%.


The S&P 500 — up for a third straight day Tuesday — still holds five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which is an elevated count. But the institutional selling hasn't held the index from making solid advances. The S&P 500 is close to losing the July 9 distribution day. If the S&P 500 rises to 3,309.65, or 5% from the closing price of July 9, then that distribution day will fall off the count.


But the Nasdaq only has two, after the July 13 distribution day was removed, which makes sense given its leadership position during the current stock market rally. On Monday, the July 13 distribution day fell off the count because of a 5% rise from that day's close.

Stock Market Earnings: Disney
-----------------------------


Dow Jones media giant Disney jumped nearly 2% before turning unchanged in extended trading after the [company's earnings.](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-earnings-q3-2020-disney-stock/) Disney reported a surprise fiscal Q3 profit, but revenue plunged more than expected. Disney stock is forming a flat base with a 127.92 buy point within a larger consolidation. Shares are trading more than 20% off their 52-week high and are below their 200-day moving average.



Software Leaders Paycom, Twilio Report
--------------------------------------


After the stock market close, top growth stocks **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) also reported their quarterly earnings results.


Paycom reported mostly in-line adjusted earnings per share, but revenues missed analyst targets. Shares tumbled more than 5.5% in after-hours trade. The stock is tracing a consolidation with a 336.96 buy point, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows [Paycom stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-paycom-software-inc-payc.aspx) has a strong 97 out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the upper tier of growth stocks. The Composite Rating helps investors easily measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical metrics.


Twilio reported [better-than-expected Q2 earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twilio-earnings-twlo-twilio-stock-q22020/), but a key customer expansion metric fell. Twilio shares dropped about 6.6% in response in extended trade. The stock is sharply extended from a 133.10 buy point in a cup base, so investors could have taken at least some profits ahead of the earnings report.



Breakout Stocks To Watch: Costco
--------------------------------


[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/costco-stock-buy-point-july-sales/), **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), perked up Tuesday with a 3.2% advance. Shares moved decisively above a 331.59 buy point in a short consolidation. The new buy point follows others at 315.45 and 325.36. The 5% buy zone above the latest entry runs up to 348.17.


A potential flaw is the stock's lagging relative strength line. The RS line should hit a new high to confirm the breakout's strength. Costco's RS line is far from its old highs after a surge in March that occurred during the height of the coronavirus stock market crash.

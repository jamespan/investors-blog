In a typically quiet half-day on Wall Street, the stock market was little changed Monday. Things could get more interesting later in the week, however.




Quiet as it may have been, the major indexes had some notable action.


The S&P 500 edged up 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%. Both made their highest close since April 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was nearly flat but still made its highest close since Dec. 2.


Small caps outperformed as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.4%, good for its sixth straight advance. That matches a six-day win streak in January that contributed to a new-year rally.


With exchanges closing three hours early Monday, volume was much lower. The stock market will be closed Tuesday for the July 4 holiday.


Today's stock market was largely defined by the so-called Magnificent Seven that dominate the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes. Most of those heavyweights were quiet Monday.


But **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) jumped 6.4%. Over the weekend, the company [reported record global deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-deliveries-q2-record-tesla-stock/) as price cuts helped boost sales. Tesla — the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Monday — made its highest close since September.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP070323-249x300.jpg)Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gave back 0.8%, but still closed above a $3 trillion market cap. On Friday, the company became the first ever to close with a market valuation above $3 trillion.


Four Remarkable Stock Market Facts
----------------------------------


The stock market just finished an outstanding first half, especially for the Nasdaq.


The composite's 31.7% six-month gain was the best first half of any year since 1983, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The big-cap focused Nasdaq 100 surged 38.8%, for its best first half in history.


The month of June is historically weak for the stock market. But this year, the Nasdaq rallied 6.6% and the S&P 500 6.5%. The Dow added nearly 4.6%. And all 11 S&P 500 sectors rose in June for the first time since November.


Stock Market Breadth Improves
-----------------------------


As we've noted the past several weeks, stock market breadth has been improving. If that trend continues into the third quarter, it can provide a good foundation for further gains.


Even while indexes pulled back June 16-26, IBD's tracking of NYSE 52-week highs outnumbered new lows. In the Nasdaq, the balance of new highs vs. new lows was more even, though. (IBD counts only stocks above a 60 [EPS Rating.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/))



Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) outperformed SPDR S&P 500 ETF ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) in June. The equal-weight ETF jumped 7.2% vs 6.1% for the SPY ETF.


Taking the entire S&P 500, more than 72% of its stocks as of Friday were above their 50-day moving average. That's the highest level since Feb. 2, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The NYSE advance-decline line is near the highest levels of the year.


Last week's bullish moves in the major indexes led IBD to [raise its recommended exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-surges-on-inflation-data-nasdaq-makes-best-return-in-decades-amid-bull-charge/) to 80%-100%, from a 60%-80% range.


This was the first time since IBD started specifying exposure levels last December that the recommendation rose to the maximum level. However, individual investors should raise exposure gradually and as opportunities present themselves. Taking some profits is also a way to have success with a high level of market exposure.


One downside of the market's strength is that indexes are again stretched from their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). Another pullback or a period of moderation would not be surprising.


Stock Market Delves Into Economic Data
--------------------------------------


The S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 46.3 in June, down from 48.4 in May and the sharpest decline in operating conditions in 2023. Manufacturing performance has now deteriorated in seven of the past eight months.


Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the latest data added concerns about a potential recession in the second half of 2023.


"Leading the darkening picture was a severe drop in demand for goods, with new orders slumping at a rate among the steepest since the global financial crisis of 2009," Williamson said in a note. "Companies report that customers have become increasingly reticent to spend amid the rising cost of living, higher interest rates, growing concerns about the economic outlook and a switch in spending to services."


But in today's stock market, price pressures are quite important, and the PMI had good news on that front.


Input costs fell for a second straight month, S&P Global reported. Manufacturers saw the sharpest drop in material prices since May 2020.


On Friday, the June employment report is due out. And on Wednesday, the minutes of the latest Fed meeting are released. Those reports could keep fireworks going beyond July 4th.

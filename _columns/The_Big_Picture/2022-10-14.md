Stock Market Ends Week On Sour Note; Bear Market Rally?
========================================================

The major stock market indexes reversed after a higher open on Friday, dropping the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.3%, the S&P 500 2.4% and the Nasdaq a miserable 3.1%. Major benchmarks gave up much or all of Thursday's upside. Big banks held partial gains after stronger-than-expected Q3 reports.




Technically speaking, the rally attempt is intact but the reversal lowers odds for a bullish [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). The [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) remain tough resistance so that's where investors should watch when buyers return.


Dow component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) got [Q3 earnings season](https://www.investors.com/news/bank-earnings-jpmorgan-wells-fargo-morgan-stanley-citi-pnc-set-to-report/) off to a positive start, beating top and bottom line estimates. The banking giant reported a profit of $3.12 per share while revenue rose 10.4% to $32.7 billion. JPM stock rose 1.7% after trimming gains.


Morgan noted that consumer spending is still strong, with credit and debit transactions up double digits year-over-year. More importantly, the bank "isn't seeing cracks" in credit performance, telling us it will take more time for rate hikes to impact consumer behavior and Fed policy.

Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gave back all of Thursday's gains, closing near its bear market low.


Bear Market Rally?
------------------


Was Thursday just a classic bear market rally?


The biggest one-day gains in stock market history have come in bear markets, not bull markets. This usually happens when short sellers grow complacent in the weak action and take too much risk.


Markets eventually hit oversold levels as "real selling" by shareholders runs out of supply. It then takes little fuel to set off a short squeeze, in which markets lift methodically for hours, with few downturns for trapped shorts to cut losses.


And good news isn't needed for this to happen. In fact, it's less likely because positive fundamentals bring in real buyers who want higher prices.


So, it's possible that Thursday's miserable CPI print stoked short-seller complacency at the perfect time, tossing a snowball that picked up size and strength as it rolled downhill.


Stock Market: Q3 Earnings Flood
-------------------------------


[Q3 earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/nflx-stock-tesla-headline-q3-earnings-calendar-ibm-lam-research-schlumberger-also-report/) shifts into high gear the coming week, led by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) on Tuesday and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) on Wednesday. Dow components **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Dow** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) and **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) also report.



Tesla's weekly chart shows dangerous weakness, with the stock violating the May low on Friday. TSLA stock also broke an 18-month trendline this week.


[S&P 500 Q3 earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/research/q3-earnings-growth-expected-to-decline-except-for-the-energy-sector/) expectations have dropped to 4.5% while energy stocks should contribute 6.3% to profits. As a result, the rest of the index may post negative Q3 growth.


Meanwhile, crude oil is back to January levels despite OPEC+ cuts, forcing analysts to reduce 2023 energy estimates.


Soon, the S&P 500 may lose this last pillar of support.

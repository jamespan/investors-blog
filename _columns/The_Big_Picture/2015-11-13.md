Stocks stabbed lower Friday as the Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in falling under the 200-day moving average . The Nasdaq dropped 1.5%, its third loss of 1% or more during the week. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 lost 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively.


The IBD 50 skidded 1.9%.


Volume rose across the board.


The Nasdaq punctured its 200-day line one day after the S&P 500 did. The Nasdaq's 50-day line turned north recently as some ugly August days fell outside the 50-day range. But any slightly positive sign in [the current stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) is dwarfed by larger realities.


For example, the distribution count is now at a high level, and the Nasdaq suffered cluster distribution — three distribution days in the past four sessions.


Distribution involves a loss in rising volume, which is the footprint of institutional selling. Also, the new-lows count continues to bulldoze over the new highs.


Meanwhile, among IBD's 197 industry groups, only the gold-mining group rose at least 1% for the week. On the downside, retail groups took the nastiest beatings.


All this adds up to a shaky picture and an atmosphere that seems irrational.


While some of the battered retailers are low-rated stocks that have been going down for months, the bears went after quality names Friday.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) gapped down to an 8% loss in heavy volume. There was no news connected to the drop. Ulta won't report Q3 results until Dec. 3.


Recent weak news in the retail sector apparently led to an approach of shoot first and ask questions later.


**Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) shed 3% in heavy volume, also without specific news. The company will report quarterly results before the open Nov. 24.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and its Internet retailer group was one of the few retail areas where recent economic figures are encouraging. Sales for the online retailers in September rose 7.1% vs. the year-ago period.


Still, the group fell 3% Friday, and Amazon dropped 3.5% without any company-specific news.


Two things should be kept in mind. First, one week doesn't make a trend. The market remains in an uptrend, though pressured. Second, investors should look at each holding and trim where appropriate.


For the week, the Nasdaq fell 4.3%; the IBD 50, 3.9%; and the S&P 500, 3.6%.

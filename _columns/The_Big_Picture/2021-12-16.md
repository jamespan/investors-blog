  Tech Stocks Pulverized, Blue Chips Mixed; Will The Nasdaq Underperform In 2022?

Even cloud stocks suffer from rain.




**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), which transformed itself by switching to a cloud-based revenue model nearly a decade ago, got pulverized on a [dour earnings forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-stock-falls-as-fiscal-2022-earnings-revenue-guidance-miss-estimates/). New breakouts, for the most part, are stumbling or making piecemeal progress. And the Nasdaq composite's 2.5% fall even exceeded the prior day's gain that sparked a [new follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-fed-policy-decision-time-to-get-back-in/).


Blue chips, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, presented a mixed picture. The index edged 0.1% lower. But all in all, Thursday's action suggests that a new tradable rally is off to a very slippery start.


[Follow-through days do not always work](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). IBD has noted this truth over the decades.

Strength in telecom, financial, industrial and medical companies helped buffer the damage in the stock market. While the S&P 500 backtracked 0.9%, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) fell just 0.2%. Still, this ETF was up nearly 1% in the early going. So Thursday's reversal was disappointing.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dived 2.6%, surrendering all of the prior day's 2.3% gain and more. It faces yet another test of buying support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Meanwhile, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) dropped 2%. That marked IWM's lowest close since Aug. 19.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, barely so on the latter.


Small caps have seen the brunt of this sell-off among the major averages, but high-valuation growth stocks have dropped even further. Remember, in a correction, top performers tend to fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more than the key indexes. At 15,180, the Nasdaq composite stands 6.4% beneath its 16,212 all-time peak. But Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), off 3.3% on Thursday, has slid 18.4% off its 52.55 peak set on Nov. 9.


Tech Stocks Today
-----------------


The selling in tech stocks and related exchange traded funds may not be surprising. This sector has outperformed for years. In 2021, the gains still look quite handsome even after Thursday's ugly day.


Let's consider iShares Semiconductor ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)).


A 4.4% drop in higher volume on Thursday does not wreck this ETF's overall uptrend. And despite gutting all of Wednesday's 3.7% advance, the chip ETF still shows a 36% year-to-date gain.



However, on a stock-to-stock basis, investors need to be watchful for key sell rules.


**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), a 3% loser Thursday, did not trigger any sell signals.


Despite losing ground in three of the past four sessions, the semiconductor titan has a comfortable cushion above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which has been sloping sharply higher lately. The 50-day line has moved from 489 at the start of the fourth quarter to about 548 on Thursday.


Now, compare its pullback with **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), another leader in tech stocks.



The emerging new force in optical sensors for self-driving car technology whipped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) for the first time since Nov. 26. More than 1.8 million shares exchanged hands Thursday, or 136% above the stock's 50-day average.


Despite Ambarella's 14% thrashing, the stock is beating the pants off the major averages, up 95% since Jan. 1.


But a further slide below the 50-day line would give an excellent message to holders to at least nail down some profits.


How Will the Nasdaq Fare In 2022?
---------------------------------


If more tech companies trigger sell signals, be wary of trying to buy the dip in leaders. Especially tech stocks.


The Nasdaq's gain over the past two years still surpasses 119%. In contrast, the Russell 2000 ETF has posted only a 51% advance. And SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) falls in the middle, up 79%. Come January, though, will institutions opt to rotate more out of tech and into other industries?


Watching the breadth of the Nasdaq will be valuable. And right now, the slump of the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has only gotten worse over the past five weeks. In contrast, the NYSE's advance-decline line has also dipped over the same time frame, but the depth of the decline has been less intense.

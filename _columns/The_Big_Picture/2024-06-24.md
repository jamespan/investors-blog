Growth stocks and their value-type peers went on diverging paths Monday.




The Nasdaq composite, clearly a bastion of leading growth stocks over the decades, sank nearly 1.1% to 17,496. That marked the index's third straight decline with four more trading sessions left in June as well as the first half 2024.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Despite this three-day slide, the Nasdaq's year-to-date performance remains robust, up 16.5%. June also marks the second month in a row in which the Nasdaq rallied to all-time highs. Look at the 100 largest Nasdaq companies and the short-term record has been equally bullish.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), down 1.3% on Monday, has risen in six of the past seven months. Thus, a breather at this juncture seems totally normal.


Nonetheless, it's smart to keep paying attention to how both the major indexes and the [leading growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) perform â€” especially with the most recently bought positions.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 edged down 0.3%, while an equal-weighted version, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), actually inched up 13 cents to 165.72 for its fifth straight up day.

The Russell 2000 finished the session up 0.4%, trailing a 0.6% gain by the S&P MidCap 400. (See the chart on [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) by typing in zero-SPMC).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a laggard so far in 2024, rose nearly 0.7%.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) led the blue chips, accounting for 78 of the Dow's 260 points in Monday's gain. Another eight members of the 30-stock Dow Jones rallied 2 points or more. Among these nine stocks that did well, four hold a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) of 80 or higher: GS, **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)).


However, keep in mind that 2024 has benefited, for now, those investors who have concentrated in megacap and large cap growth stocks that have shown more relative strength.


Since Jan. 1, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) is up 5%. That pales in comparison with a 14.2% lift by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)).


Volume fell on both main exchanges. The main reason? Friday saw a huge pop in turnover on the expiration of monthly and weekly options and futures on both stocks and indexes.


As for Monday's poor showing by growth stocks, one really need not look far beyond one of the hottest themes in recent years: artificial intelligence.


Why Growth Stocks Fell Today
----------------------------


AI-related companies, many of which have led the stock market all year, fell sharply. Among the most notable included **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)). ([Go to today's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) to hear how panelists have been deciding how to hedge long positions in leaders in this space.)


Qualcomm, down 5.5% in a third straight decline in heavy volume, undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). A break of this technical level comes a little more than seven weeks after Qualcomm's breakout. Thus, one could decide to defend gains by selling at least part of the position.


Another reason to lock in gains in top growth stocks? After the leader in wireless communications technology broke out of a [shallow double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) at 175.99 on May 2, it rallied more than 25% in the space of less than seven weeks. A 20%-to-25% profit, under normal conditions, serves as a very good sell rule.

Another Sell Rule For Growth Stocks
-----------------------------------


Super Micro, in the meantime, is at a different phase in its life cycle for growth stocks.


A huge winner in both 2023 and in the first two months of this year, the AI data center infrastructure play has been in base-building mode since peaking at 1,229 on March 8. In recent weeks, Super Micro tried to clear an aggressive entry near 900, created by a trend line drawn from the base's high. However, the large cap tech reversed badly on Thursday. On Monday, shares fell another 8.7% and crossed below the 50-day line.


Losses need to get cut even in the best stocks on early entries. Why? You never know just how far they could decline while still in a base.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Super Micro's Relative Strength Rating stands at 99 on a scale of 1 to 99. However, the RS Rating should be used as a stock selection tool, not for market timing.


Growth Vs. Value Stocks
-----------------------


Investors on Monday seemed to accumulate value-type stocks. As proof, the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) rose 0.8%. In contrast, its counterpart, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) fell almost 1%. However, the growth ETF shows a stout 7% gain for the quarter, while the value fund is still down nearly 1.6% over the same period.


So it would be interesting to see if the market tide decides to turn after the current quarter ends.


At a granular level, even among growth stocks, those with bigger price runs have cooled off. For example, within the hot shoes industry group, **Skechers USA** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) made a bullish bounce off its 21-day exponential moving average on Friday, then rose 2% on Monday.



Skechers, which has gained a ton of popularity for its slip-on sneakers, has jumped 19% past a breakout from a double bottom at 62.85. Meanwhile, group peers **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) and **On** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) continue to cool off.


Skechers trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18, according to its weekly chart on [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF). That's much lower than 31 times future earnings for Deckers and 45 times for On.


The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hardly moved on Monday. According to Cboe data, the yield finished virtually flat at 4.25%.


On Tuesday, watch for [new data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) on housing prices and consumer confidence.

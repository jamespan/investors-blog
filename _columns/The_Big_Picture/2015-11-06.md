The stock market shuffled the cards Friday and came up with new winners and losers for the day, as a strong payrolls report increased the odds of an interest rate hike.

  

The Nasdaq posted an 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. Small caps led as the Russell 2000 added 0.8%.

  

The IBD 50 advanced 0.4%.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges.

  

While the Nasdaq showed good action Friday — a positive reversal and a close high in the day's range — the S&P 500 had to settle for finishing just below the day's breakeven line.

  

Dividend stocks played a key role in the S&P 500's struggle to keep pace. **Southern Company** ([SO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SO)) dropped 4.5%. **Simon Property Group** ([SPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPG)) fell 4%. **Colgate Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) shed 2.6% and 1.1%, respectively.

  

All are members of the S&P 500, and none was reporting earnings. Each appeared to be reacting to the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate hike. If the Fed begins hiking rates, dividends will look less attractive vs. other yield-oriented investments.

  

The Federal Reserve's next two-day meeting will be held Dec. 15-16.

  

If dividend stocks were acting as if their party was about to end, other stocks were celebrating.

  

The super-regional banks industry group gapped up about 3.5%, according to preliminary data. It isn't often that an entire industry gaps up, but nearly all 12 stocks in the group did just that.

  

**SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), a holding company for Silicon Valley Bank, leapt almost 7% in twice its usual volume.

  

Small banks have been gaining in recent weeks, but Friday's winners included some big players.

  

The money center banking group rushed 1.8% higher. **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) led with a 4.5% gain.

  

While Congress and the Fed have seemed convinced since 2008 that the way to help the banking sector was to force banks to lift reserves, some economists say that it has only tightened the money supply and prevented normal growth.

  

If the Fed's critics are right, then higher interest rates might give banks better margins and lead to more loans and more growth in the economy.

  

If the Fed's critics are wrong, then the market at least seemed to temper its reaction as the rate situation moves closer to clarity. Certainty would be a positive for the market.

  

Higher rates aren't a certainty, but late Friday, CME Group's FedWatch tool put the probability at 69.8% for a rate hike in December. The previous month's probability was less than 5%.

  

Banks weren't the only winners Friday. Chips provided another area of strength. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.6%.

  

At this juncture, individual investors should look for strong industry groups that might thrive in an atmosphere of slowly rising rates. Then look within the group for leaders near buy points.

  

For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 gained 2.8%; the IBD 50, 2%; the Nasdaq, 1.8%; and the S&P 500, 0.9%.

  

In the coming week, the earnings season continues. Companies reporting earnings include **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) on Monday; **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) on Tuesday; and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) on Wednesday.

  Stock Market Fights Back From Sharp Losses, But Can It Build On Momentum?

The way the stock market ran ragged Monday morning, it looked like indexes were headed for a bear market. The way they ended, it looked like the selling exhausted itself.




In a day of sharp moves, at least a relief rally looked to be in the offing.


Indexes plunged in the first 90 minutes of trading, with the Nasdaq composite falling as much as 2.7% and the S&P 500 sliding more than 2%. But from then on, the stock market started cutting away losses.


Although the S&P 500 prolonged its losing streak to five days, the S&P and Nasdaq erased nearly all of their steep losses. By the close, the Nasdaq actually had a minor gain, after it found support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP011022-218x300.jpg)The S&P 500 trimmed its loss to just 0.1%. Still, it closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since Dec. 20, which marked a short-term low in the index at the time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also pared losses, ending down a bit more than 0.4%. The Dow found support at its 50-day moving average after dipping below the line Monday morning.


Small caps' rebound saw the Russell 2000 close 0.4% lower. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared higher on the NYSE as well.


What Happens Next In Stock Market
---------------------------------


The stock market now needs to show it can follow up Monday's reversals with more gains. It could be a tough week to rally, however.


Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appears before a Senate committee Tuesday morning for his [confirmation hearing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-faces-senate-questions-over-fed-plans-to-contain-inflation-11641846089). No doubt, he'll be quizzed on inflation and interest rate policy.


Earnings reports will start this week with **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) offering the first look at the suddenly slumping homebuilding industry on Wednesday.


Major banks **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) report Friday morning.


With so many variables at play, investors would do well to remain cautious. [IBD's stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) is "uptrend under pressure," and investing in growth stocks has been as tough as a blizzard.


The IBD 50 plunged 9.2% last week and lost 0.7% more Monday, as it also trimmed losses. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sank to a one-year low before bouncing back.


Some Growth Stocks Under Stress
-------------------------------


Multiple IBD 50 stocks are flashing sell signals while others act poorly.



**Atlas Air Worldwide** ([AAWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAWW)) is more than 8% below its 95.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), which [caused a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Its 88 Composite Rating reflects some leadership in the stock market. Yet, those with a [Composite score](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 95 or higher tend to outperform.


**AMN Healthcare Services** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)) also fell more than 8% from its buy point. AMN, a health care staff outsourcing firm, Monday issued preliminary Q4 results, saying it expects revenue of $1.35 billion to $1.36 billion, and operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in the range of 11.8%-12.3% and 15.3%-15.8%, respectively.


Also in the stock market, health care leaders **Steris** ([STE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STE)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) are below their [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) fell below its 673.90 buy point in a long [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)) gapped below its 50-day line in active trading.



Energy and financial sectors are holding up, and some offer better charts. That includes a great many regional banks and larger institutions such as **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)), **Houlihan Lokey** ([HLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLI)), JPMorgan, **SVB Financial Group** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)).


As The Big Picture has noted already, rising yields are fueling demand for financial stocks.


On Monday, the benchmark 10-year bond yield briefly touched a two-year high before easing to 1.78%. It was the sixth consecutive increase in yields, marking the largest six-day yield gain since March 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Something similar is happening with the energy sector, where rising oil prices have been climbing for more than a month.

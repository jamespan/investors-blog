The stock market turned in another fine performance Wednesday, overcoming a weak open and ending mixed and little changed. But below the surface, several highflying recent IPOs took big hits, including **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)), **Eargo** ([EAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAR)), **Array Technologies** ([ARRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRY)) and **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)).




Major stock indexes turned higher slightly higher in afternoon trading after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said they were willing to back a $900 billion stimulus package as a basis for negotiations with Senate Majority Leaders Mitch McConnell. That's much lower than an earlier $2.2 trillion package supported by the Democrats.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been getting turned away at the 30,000 level for nearly a month, but it recovered well after falling nearly 0.8% at the open. The blue-chip index added 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.1% in the first half-hour but fought back for a loss of less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index edged up 0.1%.


![2MP120220](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2MP120220-202x300.jpg)Nasdaq volume came in lower than Tuesday. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE also fell. Advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners on both main exchanges.


Oil and gas stocks and financial stocks outperformed, but several software-related industry groups lagged. The enterprise software group fell 0.7%, but the group held up relatively well in light of an 8.5% decline for **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)). [Earnings and sales topped expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-acquires-slack-stock/), but Wall Street seems to be wondering if Salesforce's best days of growth are behind it. As part of its earnings report, Salesforce confirmed its acquisition of **Slack** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)) for $27.7 billion.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) snapped a four-session win streak, falling 1%. Semiconductor stocks **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) outperformed in the IBD 50. **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)) and **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) lagged.


Recent IPO and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) dived 12% after a Morgan Stanley downgrade. After soaring 52% last week, shares are down 19% so far this week. A key support level to watch is the stock's 21-day exponential moving average, currently at 19.69.


Palantir joined Leaderboard on Nov. 5 just ahead of breakout from an IPO base with a 11.52 by point. The position was trimmed on Nov. 24 when the gain from the buy point hit 100%.


Sellers were in **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) for the third straight session. Shares slumped 4% to 292.69. It broke out solidly over a 301.10 buy point last week. But the enterprise software firm gave a sell signal Wednesday by erasing a double-digit gain from the buy point. Snowflake lost another 5% in after-hours trading after reporting [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-stock-snow-earnings-q3-2020/).


Early after-hours earnings winners included three top stocks in the security software group. **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) showed gains ranging from 5% to 10%. Group peer **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) is also worth watching as it holds near highs after an earnings breakout last month.


Bullish Sentiment Stays High
----------------------------


Stock market bulls got some good news Tuesday when three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) were erased from the Nasdaq's count. That's because the index rallied 5% from the closing prices on Nov. 9, 12 and 18.


But that good news was tempered Wednesday by another rise in bullish sentiment from the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers. The bulls rose to 64.7% from 64.6% the prior week and 59.6% the week before that. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.


Readings above 60% are considered excessively bullish. Bullish sentiment hit 61.8% in early October 2018 just ahead of a sharp market pullback. More recently, the bulls hit 61.5% in early September ahead of a decline of nearly 13% for the Nasdaq.


But don't get too down on the market just yet, because there's still a large supply of growth stocks acting just fine.


Top Growth Stocks Hold Their Own
--------------------------------


**Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) reversed nicely higher after coming close to a test of its 21-day exponential moving average. It's been holding gains well after its earnings gap on Nov. 12.

**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) fell nearly 3% but closed near highs. The decline only amounted to a solid test of the 10-day moving average.


**RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) soared past a 309.23 buy point, helped by news of a partnership with **Vodafone** ([VOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VOD)) where RingCentral will deliver its cloud-based communications services.


Two [marijuana stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/marijuana-stocks-house-legalization-vote-more-act/) outperformed nicely in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).



**GrowGeneration** ([GRWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRWG)) bounced nicely off its 10-day moving average, rising 6%. It hasn't looked back after reclaiming a 21.43 buy point with conviction on Nov. 12. **Canopy Growth** ([CGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGC)) rebounded after two straight declines. Shares jumped nearly 6% Wednesday after a breakout from a long consolidation on Nov. 6. It's holding just above an alternate entry of 27.05, 10 cents above its Nov. 9 high.

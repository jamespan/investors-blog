Stock Market Rally Fades With Biden Set To Release Stimulus Plan; Hot IPO Stocks Airbnb, DoorDash Hit Buy Points

The major stock indexes reversed lower Thursday, as President-elect Joe Biden was expected to unveil details of his stimulus plan. Top growth stocks and small caps sharply outperformed, while big-cap tech stocks disappointed.




Thursday evening, Biden was expected to release the details of his plan. A [CNN report](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/13/politics/biden-covid-relief-package/index.html) detailed a stimulus package worth roughly $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Fed chief Jerome Powell reaffirmed low interest rates for the foreseeable future. "When the time comes to raise interest rates, we'll certainly do that, and that time, by the way, is no time soon," Powell said during a video Q&A session presented by Princeton University.


The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 2.1% as small caps continued to outperform. The S&P 500 moved down 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.2%.


Leading growth stocks led the way, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.6% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 11-ranked **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) surged as much as 15.4% before paring gains to 5.7%. Shares are sharply extended from a 51.20 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) and investors could take at least some profits.

Stock Market Rally Fades
------------------------


The Dow Jones industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 snapped two-day win streaks Thursday. The Dow 30 and Nasdaq set record highs before reversing lower. The S&P 500's decline  in higher volume results in a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


With three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq, and more on the S&P 500, there is a moderate amount of institutional selling. Investors should remain confident, especially with the strength in top growth stocks and small-cap stocks, typically considered riskier investments.


Keep in mind the Nasdaq remains sharply extended from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), so a pullback would be no surprise. The composite ended more than 6% above it on Thursday. Historically, when the Nasdaq is about 6% above its 50-day line, it will begin to pull back.


Last [Thursday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-hits-record-highs-biden-win-apple-stock-new-buy-point/) discussed how indexes can remain extended for a period of time before any pullback.


Instead of trying to guess whether the stock market will rise or fall, more important is the interpretation of the daily action of the indexes and the top growth stocks.


Leading stocks continue to outperform — as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF showed — although big-cap tech stocks disappointed Thursday. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) declined 1.5%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) lost 1.5%. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) declined 1.1%.


Chip Stocks Outperform
----------------------


Chip stocks were among the best performers amid [bullish sales guidance](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/tsm-stock-q4-earnings-outlook-beat-views/) from [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)). TSMC surged 6% after paring gains. IBD 50 stocks **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) jumped 7.9% and 5.9%, respectively.


Notably, graphics-chip makers **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) declined 1.1% and 2.5%, respectively. Nvidia is forming a flat base with a 587.76 buy point, while AMD, which is also a leader in PC microprocessors, is pulling back to its 50-day line.

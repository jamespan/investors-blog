title: Dow Jones, Nasdaq Make New Highs Again; Time To Sell InMode Stock?

A few major indexes gained enough ground to mark new highs Tuesday. But the action in individual leaders seemed more interesting.




Such action included big moves up that justified some timely profit-taking; others made big moves down that actually served a constructive role or hinted at some desire by institutional investors to rotate into other sectors.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite scraped their way to all-time highs in the first 30 to 40 minutes of trade, but failed to make more progress. While these two indexes, plus the Russell 2000, gained 0.1% or less, the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%.


A pleasant surprise in the services side of the U.S. economy, announced at 10 a.m. ET, did not spur much follow-on buying. The ISM nonmanufacturing survey in October showed a 54.7 reading, up from 52.6 the prior month and exceeding the [Econoday forecast of 53.5](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). A reading above 50 signifies expanding economic activity.

CLOSE




Crude oil and long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds made much bigger moves. The former rallied more than 1.2% to breach the $57-per-barrel level. The latter sold off hard, sending yields on the benchmark 10-year note flying 7 basis points higher to 1.86%. Two-year notes yielded 1.63%.


This sharp rise in long-term interest rates — in fact, to the highest level in nearly two months — perhaps led to more selling in the housing and related sectors.


Rotation, Rotation
------------------


Looking at [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-nov-05-2019/), mortgage services firms made the third largest drop, down 2.4%, according to early data. Homebuilders, home furnishings retailing, wood products, cement and concrete groups all fell 1% or more on a price-weighted basis too.

Another sector of the stock market, interest rate-sensitive utilities, has been selling off lately. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones utility average fell 1% to 848, increasing its loss for the fourth quarter to nearly -3.5%.


In contrast, the Nasdaq composite, ending the session at 8434, boasts a 5.4% lift since Oct. 1. Even the S&P SmallCap 600 is smashing the utilities lately, rising more than 5% for the quarter.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained more than 0.4%, stretching its quarter-to-date rally to 3.5%.


Total Trading Rises
-------------------


Volume expanded vs. Monday's levels on both main exchanges. But no fresh [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) was born, due to the puny decline in the S&P 500. Rather, an Oct. 1 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the S&P 500 expired on time. The Market Pulse now shows just three days of [intense institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) for the two benchmarks.


Just three weeks ago, the count had ballooned to seven on the Nasdaq, eight on the S&P 500.


What's also bullish? The remaining [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) showed small drops in price. On the Nasdaq, the average decline among the Oct. 16, Oct. 18 and Oct. 22 sell-offs is a reasonable 0.6%; on the S&P 500, the mean drop is less than 0.4%.


A thriving bull market can handle these kinds of bursts of profit taking by hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, insurers and the like.


Also in the Market Pulse table, notice how Tuesday's session revealed a few more top growth stocks falling in heavy volume vs. those rising in abundant turnover? This underscores the concept of sector rotation. The "Leaders down in volume" portion points to significant selling among financial payments and housing-related shares.



Meanwhile, companies such as **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **L3Harris Technologies** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) are eyeing tests of their 200-day moving averages, while **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) is below its 200-day line. They are also trying to carve out a bottom after selling off intensely since the summer to early fall. These shakeouts are critical to building a complete base and setting up a new breakout.


Beyond The Dow Jones
--------------------


Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is still percolating with evidence of growth, even if it's mild.


Troy Gayeski, co-CIO at SkyBridge, an investment management firm, notes that on the "good news" side of the coin, consumer credit quality continues to rise, even as economic growth slows. He notes that the twin ratios of debt to U.S. GDP and debt to income just made new lows since the 2008 Lehman Bros. crisis. Ratios of total financial obligation, debt service and mortgage debt service have hit "39-year data series lows." And finally, the national savings rate is running at an "impressive 7.5% to 8.5%."


"So, the consumer has managed to spend at a healthy sustainable rate while simultaneously deleveraging and boosting savings," Gayeski told IBD in an email exchange.


Sell This New Top Growth Stock, Or Hold?
----------------------------------------



The pickup in consumer spending helps explain why some IPOs such as **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), [a former Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), has done really well in 2019.


The stock surged more than 19% and made a new high of 42. Volume bulged 267% more than its 50-day average. At the session high, the gain from a breakout past a 29.48 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [narrow cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) hit 42%. The innovator in minimally invasive treatment technology for the cosmetic surgery market posted a 77% jump in third-quarter earnings to 46 cents a share.


That's a truly handsome gain. But it also justifies selling even a small portion of a large position since it more than meets the [key rule of selling on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/). That is, when you have gains of 20% to 25% after a breakout, take the gains frequently.

---


No doubt, though, a 20% gain within one, two or three weeks of a breakout also means that you can decide to [hold the stock for a minimum eight weeks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/), then decide on whether to hold or sell. InMode, who has hired Hollywood celebrity Paula Abdul as a brand ambassador, went public on Aug. 8 at 14 a share. This means that a typical lockup of shares held by insiders and early investors should last through early February.


What To Watch In November And December
--------------------------------------


Meanwhile, LPL Financial research has found that looking at data going back to 1950, on average the November-December period shows a 6.2% gain when the S&P 500 scores a 20% advance or more during the first 10 months of the year.


"The S&P 500 has also never fallen in the final two months of the year after closing October up more than 20% for the year," Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL, wrote in a note to clients.

Stock market indexes skidded for a third straight session, swooning to the lowest levels of the year so far. Want more bad news? The S&P 500 is down 22.2% from its prior high, which is considered a bear market for the index. Treasury yields continued to surge and the yield curve is flattening again.




After gapping down at the open, indexes remained weak into the close. The four-day losing streak in the main indexes is now the largest since March 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The precipitous drop rivals that year's Covid market crash. Except this time, we're already at least five months into a market decline.


The S&P 500 closed 3.9% lower. The index is actually late in earning the dubious bear-market distinction. The Nasdaq composite is off 33% from its January highs and has been in a bear market for months.


The small-cap Russell 2000 was in a bear market as far back as January. It is now some 30% below the Nov. 8 high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, off 2.8% Monday, is about 17% below its November peak.

Yields Frighten Stock Market
----------------------------


A sense of dread took hold of the stock market Friday, when the [consumer price index not only came in hot again](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-shock-new-40-year-high-dow-jones-futures-fall/) but eclipsed the previous high mark from March. The news sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield soaring Friday and Monday, accelerating an advance that began in late May. Yields surged more than 30 basis points in the past two sessions.


Monday's jump in the benchmark yield (to 3.371%) was the largest since March 18, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Over the past four sessions the yield is up 40 basis points.


The yield curve is tightening again. The two-year Treasury yield climbed 23 basis points to 3.279%. It added more than 64 basis points in the past seven days. That's the largest seven-day spike since November 2001, based on Dow Jones Market Data numbers. The [two-year and 10-year yields inverted in April](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y), historically a precursor to a recession.


The Federal Reserve meets this week, fully committed to at least another half-point interest rate increase. Futures indicate a nearly 73% chance of a 50-basis point hike this week. But the odds of a 75-basis point increase are now better than 27%. A week ago, those odds were at just 3%, according to [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, soared Monday. The index is more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, which could indicate at least a short-term low. The put-call volume ratio topped 1.2 Monday. That's another sign of extreme fear that may signal a bottom. But similar signals earlier this year have not resulted in sustained market gains.


IBD 50 Down Sharply
-------------------


The IBD 50 tumbled 5.5% as all but one stock in the index (**World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE))) closed lower. More than a dozen fell below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), including **Graphic Packaging** ([GPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPK)), **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)), **Beacon Roofing Supply** ([BECN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BECN)) and **National Fuel Gas** ([NFG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFG)).



With little appetite for risk in the market, cryptocurrencies were routed.


Bitcoin fell to $23,250 late Monday. The 15% drop made it the largest since a 26.7% slide March 12, 2020.Â It is also down about 19% from its price Saturday afternoon, according to Coinbase. Ethereum was down more than 15% in the past 24 hours.


ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ([BITO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITO)), an ETF that tracks Bitcoin futures, fell more than 20% to an all-time low. **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)) sank 11.4% in heavy volume. **Riot Blockchain** ([RIOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIOT)) dropped 10% to a November 2020 low.


**Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) fell more than 9%. That triggered [a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), and the stock was removed from [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard-offer/?src=AURLEDW&refcode=Search%7CGoogle%7CGoogle%7C2021%7CFeb%7CLeaderboard%7C0%7C%7C658374&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=Leaderboard---(S)---U.S.&campaignid=12979139916&utm_content=leaderboard-general&adgroupid=135969202703&utm_keyword=ibd%20leaderboard&matchtype=p&device=c&placement=&network=g&creative=601600335770&utm_name=trafficado&pdsch=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwJuVBhCAARIsAOPwGASVHoX9YkPLCr_MjucV7BUUHOPmc9J0Zt8MsrB5EldzYSWAa9WvvKcaAhJLEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).


Stock Market Energy Sector Tests Support
----------------------------------------


The energy sector was one of Monday's weakest, down 5.2%. Yet, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) found support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration ETF ([XOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOP)) hasn't touched its 10-week or 50-day lines yet, but also pared losses.


Mark Haefele, UBS global wealth management chief investment officer, said he expects high oil prices to remain elevated, despite pledges from OPEC+ to boost production.


"With members of the group already struggling to meet existing production targets, we do not expect a significant increase in new barrels reaching the market," he said in a research note. "The EU's ban on Russian oil imports, though staggered, will also curb global crude supplies in coming months."

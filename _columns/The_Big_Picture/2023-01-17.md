Stock Market Glued To 2023 Highs Despite Mixed Earnings; Is This The New Bull Market?
======================================================================================

Stock market indexes chopped sideways near big resistance levels Tuesday, awaiting catalysts later this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average put a damper on bullish sentiment, with financial components **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) getting blasted after bad quarterly reports.




Tuesday volume nearly matched Friday levels as investors continued to make January bets. Major benchmarks are pushing up against tough ceilings, as investors hope for new highs amid worries about a continuation of 2022's dismal price action.


Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. Although the S&P 500's loss was moderate, it was barely enough for a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) — the first of the new market uptrend. As distribution days go, this one should not be alarming. The mild drop and the context of the market's rise make this less of a concern.


This busy economic reporting week could move the stock market either way.


Wednesday's producer price index (PPI) report will look at inflation at the wholesale level. We'll also get December retail sales, for a final word on the 2022 holiday sales season. Housing data near week's end could attract buyers, with moderating mortgage rates drawing in millennial buying interest.


The 10-year Treasury yield added two basis points to 3.53%. Crude oil surged to a three-week high before settling above $81 per barrel.


Natural gas bounced off last week's 18-month lows, rallying more than 7%. Warm winter weather in Europe has turned a crisis into a selling opportunity for the commodity futures market.

IBD raised its outlook to "confirmed uptrend" at the start of 2023, in recognition of stronger stock market price action, fueled by the new year's optimism. That has played out in the first three weeks of January, with progressively higher prices and legitimate buying of 2022's most beaten-down tech names.


However, major benchmarks continue to struggle at or near major moving averages, and resolution could take time. The best scenario: Instruments build bases at new support that act as springboards for strong price action into the second quarter.


Davos Economic Elite
--------------------


The world's business and economic elite have descended on Davos, Switzerland, this week for the first World Economic Forum in three years. Local authorities reported dangerously high fossil-fuel emissions from the dozens of private jets flown into the resort. The pollution presents an irony for billionaire elites who push climate-change policies.


U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet with China Vice Premier Liu He Wednesday to air differences in current trade and economic polices. China's reopening has captured the world's attention, with concerns about how their enormous economic engine will impact growth and inflation.


Political leaders were notably absent.


The public is deeply skeptical about rich folks handpicking global goals, as evidenced by the populist sentiment that elected Donald Trump. [According to an Oxfam report released before the conference,](https://www.barrons.com/news/as-davos-opens-oxfam-urges-billionaire-busting-policies-01673827508) the world's richest 1% gained nearly twice as much wealth as the other 99% combined in the last two years. This probably won't sit well with those looking for equity, diversity and inclusion.


What To Do Now
--------------


All major indexes are trading near monthly highs but lacking catalysts to break through major resistance levels. That tells investors to look for opportunities while keeping a big cash hoard.


The S&P 500 is above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) and testing the 200-day moving average, which marks the dividing line between bull and bear markets. Strong or positive earnings reports this week could bring reluctant bulls off the sidelines, setting up a breakout.



A strong buying impulse above the down trendline at the SPDR Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) 400 level will set off potent buying signals that could yield nice returns, and perhaps a signal of the end of the bear market. But smart investors will bide their time, waiting for the market to set up low-hanging fruit to scoop into their investment accounts.


In addition, the Nasdaq composite shows weaker price action, held down by still-underperforming Big Tech stocks. That index needs to power above 11,700 — about where the 200-day average is — to better signal a bull market advance.


Stock Market: Monday Movers
---------------------------


Dow Jones components **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) led Monday's market movers, all for different reasons.


Goldman missed Q4 top- and bottom-line estimates, dropping 6.4%.



Guggenheim downgraded Microsoft to sell (ouch), dropping the price target to 212. MSFT stock fell in early trading but recovered losses, closing up 0.5%.


Disney stuck like glue to 100 after rejecting Trion Management's proxy bid, insisting that founding partner Nelson Peltz "has no track record in big-cap media." However, Disney's track record is also horrendous, with a 0% return to shareholders in the last eight years.


Finally, Travelers triggered declines throughout the property and casualty insurance group after posting steep losses due to ferocious winter storms. TRV stock fell 4.6% as industry giant **Allstate** ([ALL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALL)) fell 2.5% in sympathy with its rival.

The stock market fell Tuesday but closed in better shape than it started the day, as indexes now try to fight off a rash of distribution.




The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


In the Dow, **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) remained a drag, [falling 6% more](https://www.investors.com/news/general-electric-keeps-diving-as-longtime-bull-sees-no-meaningful-changes/). But **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) broke out of a flat base with a 47.08 buy point. Wells Fargo upgraded the stock to outperform and raised the possibility that Coke may enter the alcoholic-beverages market.


As investors watch their dashboards, some gauges show engines humming along, but a few warning lights are flashing.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MP_7x2_111417-216x300.png)One of the warnings is the elevated number of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). It increased to seven on the Nasdaq with Tuesday's drop in higher trade. But the S&P 500 still has little distribution, and all of the Nasdaq's distribution days were losses of less than 1%. The way most leading stocks are holding up or advancing from buy areas also supports the notion that the market is not in peril.


That's not to minimize the importance of distribution days,  because they can spot institutional selling even while indexes are trending higher.


Complacency can be as fierce an enemy as institutional sellers, and that's one trend reflected in market newsletters.


Last week's spread between newsletters making bullish forecasts (64.4%) and bearish calls (14.4%) was the widest positive spread since early 1987, according to Investors Intelligence. Signals in the bull-bears survey can be difficult to read, but it's showing a frothy market.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been trending lower for more than a month, and now the NYSE's A-D line is flattening and starting to turn lower. If indexes are rising, it's better to have broad market participation.


Small caps — a disappointing part of the market for most of 2017 — face new difficulties. The Russell 2000 closed below the 50-day moving average Tuesday after an attempt to regain the line fizzled.


Meanwhile, utilities, consumer staples and real estate investment trusts — asset classes known for the security of dividends and dependable revenue streams — are performing better.


The Dow utilities led with a 1.2% jump Tuesday, while the SPDR Utility ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ETF broke out to new highs this week. IBD's property REIT industry group this week touched the highest level since Aug. 2, 2016. The SPDR Consumer Staples ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) ETF is up five of the past six days, rising more than 4% in that span.


On the plus side, indexes are well above 50-day lines. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq often closed high in their daily price ranges in the past few weeks.


Earnings season is nearly done, and leading stocks came out mostly in fine shape. In fact, the S&P 500's increase in EPS of 6.8% for the third quarter only bolstered the case for a continued bull market. The percentages of companies that reported better-than-expected earnings and sales exceeded historical averages, according to CFRA Research.


Strong profit growth is an especially important pillar for a market whose valuations are stretched, near 10-year highs according to the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. A corporate tax cut, even if comes up short of the 20% that Republicans seek, would be another boost to profits.


In a broader sense, the economy is expanding and there are few signs that the cycle is topping.


Tuesday's trading saw defensive industry groups leading, such as utilities and food producers.


Energy, telecom and metals stocks were some of the weakest. Oil prices fell 2% to about $55 a barrel after a soft demand forecast from the International Energy Agency. Biotechs also were noticeably weaker. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) ETF slid below its 200-day moving average.


**Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)), an IPO that vaulted as much as 152% after Wednesday's earnings report, reversed lower and lost more than 13%.


Restaurants were up about 2% after **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) soared 24% on news that Roark Capital Group [offered $2.3 billion to take the company private](https://www.investors.com/news/buffalo-wild-wings-gets-2-3-billion-plus-buyout-bid-from-roark-capital-wsj/).

title: Bears Hammer Stocks, Give Credence To R-Word

For the fourth time this month, bears smacked the Nasdaq with a daily loss of 1.5% or more.




The Nasdaq staggered 1.6% lower Thursday, while the S&P 500 tripped 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1%. Small caps as gauged in the Russell 2000 dived 2%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges.


At this juncture in [the current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), the bulls are pinning their hopes on the put/call volume ratio's 1.16 reading on May 13. The secondary gauge often pegs a short-term low when the reading either hits or exceeds 1.15 at the close. On Thursday, the ratio rose to 1.17.


The R-Word
----------


Yet in a news-driven market, China appears to hold more sway than secondary technical indicators. As long as the U.S. and China fail to agree on trade, very bad things could happen.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MP052319-300x292.jpg)The R-word, as in recession, is now being bandied about in some quarters. Morgan Stanley used the word in a note Monday, arguing that without a U.S.-China trade deal "we see the global economy heading toward recession."


While Monday's note was clearly not the catalyst for Thursday's stock market sell-off, it represented the sort of worries that are building up in the market.


On Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China "is open to the door of dialogue, but sincerity is indispensable."


The remark seemed hopeful, but the stock market appears to be getting tired of hopeful signs that consistently turn into head fakes.


What To Do Now?
---------------


What is an individual investor to do in this atmosphere?


No. 1: Investors should look for an opportunity within their portfolios to raise at least some cash.


No. 2: Buying stocks in a market correction (the current market status) is a risky idea. Think, instead, of building a sound watch list.


No. 3: Make note of the stocks currently getting hurt because of the China tariff factor. If the U.S. and China can reach some kind of deal, the market could take off. The China plays getting hurt now — such as Dow Jones components **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) — could rebound sharply.


No. 4: Stay focused on the action of the major stock indexes. Right now, stocks are facing headwinds. Wait until stocks are enjoying strong tailwinds.


Economic Data
-------------


First-time jobless claims came in at 211,000, better than the 215,000 expected.


On Friday, durable goods orders for April will be reported before the market's opening bell. Analysts expect new orders to drop 2.2%. Core capital goods, a gauge of business investment, are seen inching up 0.1%.


Random Notes
------------


On Thursday, the Nasdaq undercut its May 13 low, which means its attempted rally is dead and the index has to start again. The S&P 500 stayed above its May 13 low, keeping its count alive at Day 8. This means if a confirmed uptrend emerges soon, it likely will be on the S&P 500.

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, [oils suffered the sharpest losses](https://www.investors.com/news/crude-oil-prices-oil-stocks-fall-china-stockpiles/) Thursday. The day's gainers included tobacco, gold miners and utilities — defensive instruments.


**Southwest Gas** ([SWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWX)) was one of the defensive plays breaking out Thursday. The stock climbed to 86.92, above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 86.07. Volume, though, was only 12% above average.

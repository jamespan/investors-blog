  Oil Stocks Prop Up Dow, S&P 500, But Top Growth Names Hit Hard Again

It was a tale of two stock markets Friday as a big rally in oil stocks propped up the Dow and S&P 500. But it wasn't a good day for software stocks, and growth stocks in general, as several leading subgroups in the sector sold off. A [sales miss and weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/red-hat-stock-quarterly-earnings/) from **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) fueled the selling.




Still, the Nasdaq composite held up relatively well, ending with a loss of less than 0.3%. But the resilient performance masked another very weak session for leading growth stocks. After falling 1.3% Thursday, the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) lost another 1.7% Friday.


The Dow snapped an eight-session losing streak, rising 0.5%, but it ended just below the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index eased 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in much higher than Thursday, mostly due to the rebalancing of the Russell indexes

In the database software space, **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) dived below its 50-day line, dropping 7%. In the enterprise software group, selling was widespread in top-rated names like **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)).


Oil prices surged Friday after OPEC agreed to a modest increase in output. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $68.58 a barrel, up 4.6%.


Oil Stocks Lead The Way
-----------------------


Six of the day's top-10 performing industry groups hailed from the oil and gas sector. Oil stocks ended broadly higher, with U.S.-based exploration and production firms among the day's top performers.


**Oasis Petroleum** ([OAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OAS)), featured in Wednesday's [Industry Themes](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/best-oil-stocks-eog-resources-oasis-petroleum-diamondback-energy/) story, gapped up to a new high.


Among integrated firms in the sector, **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 4% to 45.78. It's still in buy range from a 44.72 entry. Group peer **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) continued to show good action around the 50-day moving average, rising nearly 8%.


Weak action in market-leading growth stocks and an elevated distribution day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are reasons to be cautious, but the Nasdaq showed resilience Friday. It's only 1% off its high, while the S&P 500 is still holding comfortably above its 50-day moving average, only 4% off its high. That means it's too early to adopt a decidedly bearish stance on the market.


Still, it remains a difficult environment for technical breakouts. Leading biotech and IBD 50 stock **Supernus** ([SUPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPN)) tried to clear a flat base Thursday in heavy volume, but a 5% intraday gain faded badly by the close. Shares slumped 2% Friday.

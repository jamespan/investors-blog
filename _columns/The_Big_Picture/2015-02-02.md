Stocks reversed higher in another volatile session Monday, the first trading day of February.

  

While the action was positive, it did little to change the current market picture.

  

Helped by gains in energy and financial stocks, the S&P 500 outperformed with a 1.3% gain. It pretty much erased Friday's loss. Energy makes up 8.3% of the index, while financials have a 16% weighting.

  

The Nasdaq rallied 0.9%, regaining most of Friday's loss. At Monday's low, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were off as much as 1.2% and 0.7 respectively.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.1% and the small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.9%. Leading stocks lagged on the session, as the IBD 50 rose 0.2%.

  

Volume ended lower on both major exchanges, a disappointment. Strong price action is more convincing when there's big volume behind it. But breadth was solid. Winners outpaced losers by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE and close to 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Stocks were all over the place Monday amid more lackluster economic data. Consumer spending and factory activity disappointed. ([See story](http://news.investors.com/economy/020215-737466-manufacturing-decelerate-but-forecast-upbeat-if-consumers-spend.htm).) Reports of Greece negotiating terms of its debt with its creditors helped the stock market in late trading.

  

Despite Monday's action, the market uptrend remains under pressure and the main indexes themselves continue to be in a big trading range.

  

The direction of the general market can have a big impact on individual stocks. A strong uptrend can carry most stocks, while a harsh downtrend will punish them.

  

The volatile conditions make it tough for trading growth stocks. That, along with a cluster of distribution days in recent sessions, are reasons for investors to remain cautious. While it's still OK to buy leading stocks breaking out of bases or clearing secondary buy points, you might need to make a few adjustments. For example, you could take profits at 10% to 15% and cut losses at 3% to 5%. This will maintain a 3-to-1 gain-to-loss ratio.

  

Many leading stocks have cleared buy points recently, but those making double-digit gains have been slim. **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) rose 13% from a breakout past a 54.84 entry. But it erased the bulk of that gain before rebounding a bit Monday. **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) have mostly wavered.

The specter of a trade war, concerns on how it could hit the economy, and lingering worries on inflation packed yet another one-two punch in equities on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq suffered the brunt of the sell-off.


In recent years, the tech-heavy composite has served as the vanguard among major stock benchmarks in terms of annual gains. So, no wonder then that the Nasdaq got drilled with a 2% loss to 17,899.




Here's How Bad It Was For The Nasdaq
------------------------------------


A daily chart of the premier index for growth stocks highlights two things worth a closer look. One, it's the Nasdaq's worst single-day decline since March 10. That happened to be the 25th anniversary of the dot-com bubble's top, which took place on March 10, 2000.


Two, Wednesday's negative action threw a blanket drenched in ice water on the positive action seen just two days earlier.


Specifically, Monday's 2.3% advance by the Nasdaq carried the spirit of a Day 9 follow-through day amid the market's current new rally attempt. But after Wednesday's selling massacre, the composite index fell well below the low of Monday's price bar. Investor's Business Daily research finds that's usually a no-no when it comes to a [successful follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).



Here's a closer look at the daily chart action on the Nasdaq.

Will The Confirmation Remain Intact?
------------------------------------

Notice how on Wednesday's low of 17,837, the Nasdaq index actually did not undercut last Friday's high of 17,798. That is, the Nasdaq did not completely fill in the bullish price gap caused by Friday's intraday high and Monday's intraday low of 18,030. Put another way, this index did not undercut the true low of Monday's "follow-through day in spirit."


Regardless, no long investor likes to see any index — not just the Nasdaq — get pounded in such fashion. In fact, the Nasdaq has now chalked up six such sell-offs of at least 2% or more so far in 2025. This does not include the 1.96% drubbing seen on March 13.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 1.1% on Wednesday, and small caps didn't fare much better. The Russell 2000 lost 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.3%.


Investors clearly took a defensive posture as they scooped up utility stocks. The Dow Jones Utility Average moved 0.7% higher.


Total volume soared 40% to 9.09 billion shares on the Nasdaq. Low-priced stock **VivoPower International** ([VVPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VVPR)) saw its trading volume explode to 141 million shares on Wednesday vs. the stock's 50-day average of 3.1 million shares.


New York Stock Exchange turnover fell nearly 7% to 4.18 billion shares.


Indeed, the rest of the stock market beyond the Nasdaq presented a mosaic of data that highlighted weakness. Plus, individual growth stock leaders mostly struggled during the day.

A few big winners in the property and casualty insurance space, such as IBD 50 stock **Root** ([ROOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROOT)), reversed bearishly lower after hitting new highs in heavy volume, a notable IBD sell signal to take profits.


So, IBD has decided to downshift the recommended exposure to stocks to a 0%-20% range from 20%-40%. [The range was just raised on Monday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-nvidia-tesla-nvda-tsla/).


Industries Down The Most In 2025
--------------------------------


As to be expected during a weak session, breadth was poor.


On the Nasdaq, falling stocks outpaced gainers by more than a 2-1 ratio, early data showed. On the NYSE, losers overwhelmed winners by a 9-5 margin.


[According to MarketSurge data](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), it may come as no surprise that automakers are one of the worst performing industries so far in 2025. Amid an escalation in tariffs between the U.S. and its large trading partners, the auto group has now fallen 31% since Jan. 1 on a price-weighted basis.


Other weak performers include automation and materials handling machinery, down 27%; home furnishings retailers, off 25.7%; shoes, slipping 24%; fiber-optic telecom, sliding 21.3%, solar, sinking 20.8%; coal and airlines, both plummeting 20%; and retail and shoe apparel, down 19.8%.

Beyond The Nasdaq: Commodities Surge
------------------------------------


Amid all the carnage, however, commodities outperformed.


Copper futures continued to soar. Near-term futures rose to as high as $5.37 per pound, up 34% year to date.


Crude oil briefly surpassed $70 a barrel even as some observers expect OPEC+ nations to decide at a Thursday meeting to boost production.


And finally, the yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond moved 3 basis points higher to 4.33%.

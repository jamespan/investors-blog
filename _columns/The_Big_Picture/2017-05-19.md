 U.S. stock indexes blocked the bears Friday for the second straight session after Wednesday's nasty sell-off.


The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.7% Friday, while the Nasdaq added 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 also gained 0.5%.


Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP051917-186x300.png)Wednesday's sell-off to the tune of 2.6% in the Nasdaq and 1.8% in the S&P 500 raised fears, but the indexes recovered nicely Thursday and Friday.


Indexes faded into the close Friday. That's a sign of weakness, although the selling came on a report that President Trump told Russian officials that the firing of FBI Director James Comey relieved "great pressure" on him, and another report that an official close to the president is a person of interest in the Russia probe.


The Nasdaq held its weekly loss to 0.6%, while the S&P 500 kept the drawdown at 0.4%. Both major indexes are above their 50-day moving average lines, with the S&P climbing back above its line Friday.


The coming week could provide a two-part test for the S&P 500. Since March 1, the S&P 500 has found the 2400 level problematic. Doubts also surround the 50-day line.


The Russell 2000 and the Dow Jones industrial average show similar challenges. The Nasdaq has proved resilient at the 50-day line and at the 6,000 price level.


Although the Nasdaq is looking strong, individual investors need to keep this in mind: The market uptrend remains under pressure, and until that is resolved caution is in order.


Groups That Survived The Week Nicely
------------------------------------


Some industry groups don't seem to be feeling much pressure. Last week, homebuilders, medical software, and oil and gas drillers posted weekly gains of 4% to 5%, according to preliminary data.


Other groups, while down for the week, showed good chart action. For example, the restaurant group fell 0.4% for the week, but its chart successfully tested and bounced off its 10-week line. Restaurants have been in the top 30 among 197 industry groups for six weeks in a row.


Restaurant stocks in buy zones include **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), Burger King parent **Restaurant Brands** ([QSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSR)) and **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)). Starbucks looked especially strong Friday, climbing 2.6% in volume 36% above average.


The homebuilders group was up 5% for the week. But finding homebuilder stocks that aren't extended is more difficult.


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) is sketching a flat base and may offer an early entry at 53.10, or a more conventional buy point at 53.89. The stock rose 3.5% for the week, retaking its 10-week line.


**Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) cleared a somewhat sloppy consolidation and is only about 1% above the entry. The stock gained 2% for the week. Toll will report quarterly results Tuesday at 11 a.m. ET.

Stock market victories these days need to be measured in hours or days, so Monday's rally will count as a success. Even so, indexes' action left something to be desired.




The Nasdaq rose 1.6% and closed near session highs. But for the third session in a row, the index hit a ceiling around 11,550.


The S&P 500 jumped 1.9%. It performed better in the sense that the index cleared the highs of the previous two days.


Notably, volume was significantly lower than on Friday, off 17% on the Nasdaq. In the prior session, trading may have gotten a boost from equity and index options that expired the same day. Even then, the slower activity suggested that institutional investors held back from committing much capital to the market rebound.

Financials Lead Stock Market
----------------------------


**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) (the largest contributor to the Dow's gain) rose about 3% to 4%. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rallied more than 2% and led the S&P sector ETFs. The sector has been slumping on worries about the economy that overshadowed rising interest rates, a trend that normally benefits financials.


Small caps were comparatively quiet, with the Russell 2000 index up 1.1%. Like the Nasdaq, it's also trying to get above Thursday and Friday highs.


The S&P 500 last week briefly sank more than 20% below its prior high, although it closed shy of that. A 20% decline is what traditionally defines a bear market, and some financial commentators sounded relieved that the index is rebounding from that level.


But it's really a matter of semantics now. The Nasdaq was down nearly 32% from its November peak to last week's low at 11,035. Other key indexes are buried below the [50-day and 200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). For all intents and purposes, [we've been in bear market for a while now](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/).


Investors Should Be Guarded
---------------------------


Investors should be mostly if not entirely in cash by now. If indexes can continue rebounding, a rally confirmation could happen as early as this week. But just last week, such a follow-through turned out to be a false signal.


Market confidence is low, and leadership remains cloudy as rapid changes in the [IBD 50 lineup](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) indicate. At least eight stocks went into the IBD 50 Monday.


Stock market losses echo those of the Covid-19 bear market, and other periods of severe declines.


The Dow's eight-week losing streak, for instance, is also the deepest since April 2020. The eight-week losing skid is the longest since April 1932, the era of the Great Depression.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq made it seven straight down weeks, recording their largest percentage declines since April 2020. The Nasdaq's seven-week slide also was the longest since February-March of 2001, in the early months of the dot-com bear market. The composite lost 20.4% during those seven weeks, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


S&P Global Downgrades Economic Outlook
--------------------------------------


While some hopeful signs appear from time to time, like JPMorgan's comments, Wall Street is generally gloomy.


S&P Global Market Intelligence on Monday downgraded its global GDP growth forecast to 2.9% from 3.2%, and well off the 5.1% increase in 2021. It estimates global consumer inflation at 6.7% for 2022.


"Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a wave of Covid-19 infections and lockdowns in mainland China, relentless inflation, and tightening financial conditions have disrupted production and stifled demand, causing the global economy to stall," Sara Johnson, executive director of economic research, said in the S&P Global report.



Growth is expected to return at a moderate 2.5% annual pace in the final two quarters of 2022. Analysts expect Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted in most regions.


The IBD 50 jumped 1.9% Monday, as natural resource and industrial stocks led. **Alpha** **Metallurgical Resources** ([AMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMR)) rallied 11.3% and **Comstock Resources** ([CRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRK)) added 9.2%.


Shipping stocks also led the IBD 50 as the industry shakes off some dust. **Eagle Bulk Shipping** ([EGLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGLE)) rose nearly 6% to a new closing high. **Zim Integrated Shipping** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) rose 7.8%.


When you see strength like this during a weak market, there's a good chance these stocks could be early winners in the next market uptrend. At least, it's got a better shot than the technology sector.

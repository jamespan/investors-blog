Stock Market Caps Another Good Month With Gains; S&P, Nasdaq Haven't Done This In Decades
==========================================================================================

The stock market wrapped up another successful month, with the major indexes up 3% to 5.6% in July and with the best year-to-date performance in decades.




On Monday, indexes spent almost the entire session nearly flat, content to walk away with a fifth consecutive month of gains for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. But a burst of buying came into the final five minutes.


The Nasdaq closed 0.2% higher, holding near 15-month highs. Up 37% year to date, the Nasdaq just had its best first seven months of any year since 1975. And the Nasdaq 100 index is up 44.2% so far in 2023, which is its best first seven months in its entire history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The S&P 500, also around 15-month highs, added 0.2% as well. It is up 19.5% so far this year. That's its best first seven months since 1997.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lagged other major indexes with a 7.3% gain in 2023. It's risen four of the past five months.

The small-cap index is testing the 2000 level, where resistance appeared in February and last August. That's surely a chart level to watch for a pivotal move.


Financials, Techs Leading Stock Market
--------------------------------------


Strength in regional banks helped the Russell 2000 climb 6% in July. Indeed, financials have been one of the driving forces of the U.S. stock market. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) rose 4.8% in July.


July also was a banner month for technology. The S&P 500 Information Technology Sector rose 4.5% in July and has yet to have a down month this year.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) led with a 7.8% July gain, while Communications Services Select Sector SPDR ([XLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLC)) rose 5.7%. In fact, all S&P sector indexes rose in July, which is an indication of broadening participation in the current stock market uptrend.


Volume Monday rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Friday's totals. Breadth was much better than the index performance would suggest: Advancers topped decliners by a 9-to-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 13-to-5 on the NYSE.


Thanks to a single stock, the IBD 50 rallied 1.8% to outperform all the main stock market indexes Monday.



**Symbotic** ([SYM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYM)) soared more than 50% after the maker of robotics systems used in warehouses reported June-quarter results and raised sales guidance. The stock topped buy points at 53.83 and 53.59 in heavy trading and is already extended from both.


Apart from Symbotic, it was a routine day on the IBD 50. The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) rose 0.8%. It cleared a 32.95 buy point July 18, and is at a one-year high.


Earnings, Jobs Data Ahead For Stock Market
------------------------------------------


The Dow might have closed higher if not for **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)). The health care products company gapped down in heavy volume. A federal judge rejected J&J's second attempt to put the [subsidiary that holds its talc liabilities into bankruptcy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/j-j-stock-talc-lawsuit-setback-1c6f37a4?mod=hp_DAY_4). J&J cost the Dow nearly 46 points.


One day of calm trading may be all the stock market gets this week. On Tuesday, the job openings data, aka the JOLTS report, will provide a look at the labor market. A couple of manufacturing-sector reports also are due out.


It's another busy [week for earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/). **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Pfize**r ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) are releasing quarterly results Tuesday.


**HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) and **PayPal** ([PAYP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYP)) are on Wednesday's calendar. And **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) will provide a gauge of the U.S. consumer on Thursday.


While Friday will be a slower day for earnings reports, the U.S. Labor Department will announce the July employment report.

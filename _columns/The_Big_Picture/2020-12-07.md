The Nasdaq stood nearly alone Monday, registering the only gain among the major indexes thanks to a fine day for the technology sector.




The Nasdaq rose 0.4% to mark its third consecutive record high. The composite outperformed largely because growth and technology stocks climbed, while the rest of the market snoozed.


Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rose 0.3% and came less than a point away from its record closing high of 127.03 on Sept. 2.


Semiconductor shares are a big reason for the sector's gains of late. The Philadelphia semiconductor index surged 18.6% in November and is up 5.4% so far this month. It's at record highs as well. Some internet and software industry groups also performed well Monday.


![MP120720](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP120720-208x300.jpg)Growth stocks also contributed to the Nasdaq's gain. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) rose nearly 0.4% while value stocks — measured by the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) — dropped 0.6%.


The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%. Weakness in energy, materials and other cyclical stocks appeared to hurt the S&P 500.


Small caps were nearly flat but still made new highs as the Russell 2000 closed with a 0.1% dip. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated lower on the NYSE. A few retail sector stocks got hit hard, too.


Indexes were volatile in the final half-hour of trading, but the last leg of the session showed a surge that left indexes in the higher elevations of Monday's price ranges.


Stock Market Too Frothy?
------------------------


While the stock market is at record highs, complacency remains something to be guarded about. The [put/call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) keeps hovering below 0.6. Monday's reading of 0.51 marked the 12th consecutive session in which it has been below a danger level of 0.6.


That's the longest streak since late August and early September. The ratio spent six straight days below 0.6, just at the stock market began its sharpest decline since the coronavirus bear market.


Yes, the stock market is getting kind of frothy. Leading stocks such as **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) are well above [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) hasn't stopped for a break in eight months' worth of gains.


Chip stocks are among autumn's big winners, and the [industry celebrates a sunny outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-industry-bounces-back-from-cyclical-downturn/). **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), is more than 30% above its Nov. 5 breakout. **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) is up about 25% from its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) is about 27% from its early November [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Not Many Leading Stocks Overextended
------------------------------------


But overstretched gains are not widespread, if you study the charts.


In the IBD 50, 34 stocks are in [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) or otherwise consolidating, or they are within 5% of buy points. [MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) screen of stocks in the Growth 250 that broke out in the past few weeks shows that on average, these stocks are up less than 6% from their buy points.


Indeed, investors could find themselves with dozens of [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) if the stock market continues to climb. A Santa Claus rally occurs most years.


[The IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) rose 0.4% Monday.


The stock market Monday kept watch on the coronavirus resurgence, which could cause another economic slowdown. California, New York and other states have imposed new restrictions on certain businesses.


There could be better news soon. Congressional negotiators are [working on a stimulus package](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/coronavirus-stimulus-update-congress-tries-to-reach-relief-deal.html) that has some bipartisan support. CNBC reported that the Food & Drug Administration [could approve this week the Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/covid-vaccine-fda-may-authorize-pfizers-this-week.html) from **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)).

In recent weeks, bite-size gains seem to be a recurring theme for the major equity indexes. Yet one key index for growth stocks showed heartier action for the bulls.




While the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the penultimate trading day of 2020 with gains of 0.1% to 0.2%, the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund stood out. Its 1.5% rally even bested gains of 1.1% by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) and 0.9% by SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)).


Volume came in mixed, rising on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday and falling on the Big Board.


The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials all traced such a narrow range of trading that their intraday highs and lows came inside their respective highs and lows of the prior day. In chart parlance, we call that an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/).


![MP123020_](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MP123020_-218x300.jpg)Granted, the IBD 50 ETF was in need of a nice up day; it had fallen four sessions in a row. The ETF slid nearly 4% over that short time span.


Notice on a [MarketSmith chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) or [Leaderboard chart](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) how the ETF has again held its ground near the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). This has been a nice recurring theme since mid-November. And this pattern of chart action tends to reflect brightly among leading growth stocks.


How Growth Stocks Are Doing
---------------------------


Perhaps even more notable on Wednesday? Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) ramped 2.3% higher, ending a relatively mild two-day losing streak. That far outweighs a 0.5% gain on Wednesday by the iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)).


The rise in the IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF in the fourth quarter has been anything but mild. Since Oct. 1, the fund has roared as much as 37% higher. That's helped drive the year-to-date gain to 51.3%, vs. up 15.5% for the S&P 500.


Breakouts Are Almost Never Straight Up
--------------------------------------



The latest breakouts, meanwhile, have proved a motley crew of sorts.


**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) illustrate the historical research by IBD that helps readers understand what post-breakout action should look like. In a normal bull market, as many as four out of 10 of the biggest stock market winners retreated back to the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). Sometimes they fell even a few percentage points below it too. But the strongest companies regained their footing and stepped back up to new highs.


AMD, a [half-size position on IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), finished Wednesday nearly 4% above its 88.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Twilio has dipped back into the 5% buy zone after it strode past a 333.72 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [eight-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


[The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) for Twilio goes up to 350.41.


[Panelists on IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) have discussed the action in SHOP multiple times in recent days.


Baidu Breakout
--------------


The same cannot be said for Baidu now, which has awoken from essentially a 30-month slumber after peaking at 284.22 in May 2018.



After an initial move out past a 139.08 [handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) on Nov. 4, the initial gains weren't so toasty. Shares in the former big winner of the 2000s got reeled back to the top of their [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/).


But notice on a daily chart how the five-day decline that began on Nov. 17 stopped right at its 50-day moving average. What makes this even more amazing? Every single one of those five down days came in very brisk turnover, suggesting a washout of weak holders.


Arguably one could see the price-and-volume action in the next few weeks as the formation of another [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) inside that gargantuan base.


As the [premier internet search engine of China is entering the electric-vehicle market](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/iqiyi-stock-falls-parent-baidu-stock-pops/) and making progress in self-driving technologies, the large cap made a terrific move on Dec. 9, rising past another [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 151.28 — a dime above the Nov. 16 peak.


Baidu's financial performance is heating up.


In the third quarter, earnings rose 69% to $3 a share on a 6% sales rise to $4.16 billion. The top line actually fell vs. year-ago levels in the prior two quarters. EPS growth has now averaged 103% over the past four quarters.


The Street sees earnings rebounding 24% this year to $9.26 a share and expanding 12% to $10.37 in 2021.


All Eyes On The Peach State
---------------------------


Heading into 2021, the Street will be paying fierce attention to the two Senate seats up for grabs in Georgia on Jan. 5.


"As of this writing, we believe the outcomes are effectively a tossup. Election data from November and historical experience suggest an advantage for Republicans," Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura, and his team wrote in a note sent to clients and to IBD on Wednesday. "However, significant strength in recent early voting data, along with tight polls and solid fundraising, suggest Democrats could capture both seats. The outcome will likely depend on how effectively Republicans can generate strong turnout on Election Day."

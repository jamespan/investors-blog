Stocks Start Short Week With Gains, As Trade Dives
===================================================

Stocks kicked off a short trading week higher Monday, with the main indexes starting and closing strongly.


Helped by biotechs and software stocks, the Nasdaq rallied 0.9% to a fresh 14 1/2-year high. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, which was good enough for a record closing high. Energy and mining stocks were weak, but retailers showed strength ahead of Black Friday. The S&P Retail index rallied 0.6%. Many retail stocks hit new highs Monday, extending a recent trend.


The Dow lagged due to weakness in **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)). The Dow ended fractionally higher.


The small-cap Russell 2000 leapt 1.2% and the IBD 50 rallied 0.9%.


Volume tumbled on both major exchanges from Friday's pace. Options expiration on Friday was one reason. Still, Monday marked the Nasdaq's lightest session since Aug. 29. Winners beat losers by nearly 5-to-3 on the NYSE. Nasdaq advancers topped decliners by more than 2-to-1.


The stock market will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and reopen for a half session Friday. Stocks have had a tendency to rise during the week of Thanksgiving. But trading tends to be dull and choppy, so investors need to remember that with any trading decision.


While momentum in the market has slowed from last month, the overall environment remains constructive. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have low levels of distribution. Leaders for the most part are acting fine, with few selling off. With just over a month past the Oct. 21 follow-through, trading opportunities are harder to come by, but some are still out there.


**CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) which was in Friday's Your Weekly Review, blew past a 33.56 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Volume was more than four times its average.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and **Nektar Therapeutics** ([NKTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKTR)) both tried to break out.


One factor investors should pay attention to is the put-call volume ratio, which is getting closer to levels that may signal a top. The ratio closed at 0.69 Monday after getting as low as 0.61 intraday. Readings of 0.60 or below should cause investors to take a guarded stance.


While the put-call ratio can be helpful, note that it's a secondary indicator. It closed at 0.5 on Nov. 5, and the market hardly flinched.


The level of distribution in the main indexes is the primary topping signal, and those remain few.

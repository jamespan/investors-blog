The stock market closed the month of April with broad losses Friday, but some defensive plays begged to differ.


While the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and small-cap S&P 600 each dropped 0.5% to 0.6%, gold bugs fluttered higher with glee. The SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) ETF zoomed ahead almost 2% and broke past a 122.47 buy point in volume 60% higher than normal.


It is rare for any exchange-traded fund to make an appearance in IBD Leaderboard, which launched in 2011, but this year has been an exceptional one. SPDR Gold entered the [Leaders list](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) on March 4 and is still within buy range.


In a year where nongrowth alternatives have captured institutional attention, utilities have acted like rock stars. The Dow Jones utilities rose 0.6% Friday to end near 654, up 13.3% since Jan. 1.


In contrast, some cyclicals took a shellacking Friday. Investors got spooked by **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) first-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly iPhone unit sales, and Apple's chip suppliers and more took the heat. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, or the SOX, slumped 2.6% on Friday.

Returning to the major indexes, the Nasdaq dropped 2.7% for the week, its biggest weekly decline since the week ended Feb. 5. In other words, it was the tech-filled index's worst week since the market bottomed in early February and staged a Day 4 follow-through, confirming the two-month rally.


The S&P 500 lost nearly 1.3% for the week. Gains by oil, metals, and select health care stocks helped the large-cap benchmark buffer the slide.


Higher volume on both main exchanges dealt both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 yet another day of distribution, or heavy professional selling. The high count for both indexes, as seen in today's Market Pulse table, is good reason enough for the investor to be raising cash and locking in gains if he or she has not already been doing so. Due to poor market action last week, IBD downgraded the market's current outlook to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend" on April 21.


Without doubt, the market still shows some bright spots. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) crushed views late Thursday and moved further past a recent cup-with-handle buy point at 603.34. And on Friday, the Nasdaq composite rebounded enough late in the day to hold near its 50-day moving average,  a critical support level.


The S&P 500  continues to hold above both its 50- and 200-day lines, as seen on the large daily chart on page B9.


However, a much sharper number of highly rated stocks, including recent market leaders **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), have fallen sharply below their respective 50-day moving averages in heavy volume. Such action is a key sell signal, especially for those who have bought at the most recent proper entries. Those with much bigger profit cushions can afford to wait and see if such stocks get long-term buying support at the 200-day moving average.


Keep an eye on medical stocks. While the biotech and ethical drug names are still in correction mode, other stocks in the vast sector have been forming bases and breaking out. Over the past two weeks, the IBD-screened new high list has remained rather limited in scope, but the Medical sector, while ranking still poorly among the 33 sectors tracked each day by IBD, has often topped this list.


Carl Icahn made headlines this past week by announcing to the world he's sold his position in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which plunged 11% for the week. The sudden closure of the iTunes store in China was just one reason. IBD had recently reported that Apple, at age 40, is desperately in need of doing something new to spur growth. But even new innovations may not be enough to bring back the high double- to triple-digit profit growth it was once famous for.


The law of large numbers is also against Apple, which has been an income stock for a while. In fiscal 2015, Apple earned $9.22 a share on $233.7 billion in sales. The Street now sees FY 2016 profit falling 9% to $8.35 a share. It has 5.55 billion shares outstanding. Even **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has fewer shares out, with 2.8 billion. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) tops them both with 7.86 billion shares out.

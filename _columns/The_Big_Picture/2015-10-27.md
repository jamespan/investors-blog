Transportation stocks got hit hard Tuesday, and small caps lagged badly, but the good news for the bulls was that damage didn't show up in the major averages.

  

The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, and the Nasdaq eased 0.1%. Volume rose from Monday's levels, giving the S&P 500 another mild distribution day. The Nasdaq avoided one with its small decline.

  

Transportation stocks had a rough day, weighed down by weak earnings from **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)) and **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)). Railroad stocks fared poorly with most stocks in the group ending with losses of 4% to 5%.

  

Breadth was weak on the NYSE, with declining stocks topping advancers by nearly 3 to 1. The losers-winners ratio was just over 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Money flowed into bonds after September durable goods orders slightly missed expectations and consumer confidence plunged. The yield on the 10-year note fell 2 basis points to 2.04%.

  

Small caps lagged badly again as the Russell 2000 slumped 1.2%. It's nearly 12% off its high, while the Nasdaq composite is only 3% off its high.

  

The IBD 50 outperformed, rising 0.3%, as names like **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)) and **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) climbed 2% to 4%.

  

The real strength in the market is in the Nasdaq 100. It's only 1% off its high. The bulls have to be encouraged by the way that it and the composite are holding gains after Friday's strong showing.

  

The performance of Nasdaq 100 kingpins like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has been a sight to behold. On the one hand, it's good to see institutional-quality names leading the charge in a confirmed uptrend, but it would be nice to see small caps pick up the pace.

  

That small caps are lagging doesn't create an easy environment for growth investors. Fast-growing companies are held to a high standard during earnings season. It's no sure thing that a stock will surge just because of a big earnings and sales beat expectations.

  

Still, the market is in a confirmed uptrend, so it makes sense to look for more buy candidates.

  

In the building sector, **Masco** ([MAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAS)) rose nearly 3% in decent volume and is in buy range from a 27.42 buy point. **Fortune Brands Home & Security** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) is near the top of a flat base with a 53.11 buy point.

  

**Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) is quickly building the right side of a shallow base that shows a 97.40 buy point. After the close, it reached a deal to acquire **Rite Aid** ([RAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAD)) for $17.2 billion, or $9 a share.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) edged higher after hours, after earnings and sales topped expectations. Its gross profit margin was 39.9%, above the 39% expected on Wall Street.

  

Apple is 14% off its high, and its 200-day moving average around 121.50 is a potential resistance level.

  

The Fed's decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. After Tuesday's close, CME Group FedWatch had the odds of a rate hike Wednesday at 6%.

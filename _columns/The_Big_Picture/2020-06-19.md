title: Stock Market Fades On Coronavirus Jitters, But Growth Stocks Shine Again

The stock market opened solidly higher Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite gapping above the 10,000 level. But indexes fell sharply around midday on news **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reclosed stores in Florida, Arizona, North and South Carolina due to sharp rises in coronavirus cases in those states.




Stocks fought back to trade narrowly mixed in the afternoon, although sellers came back into the stock market during the final few minutes of the session.


The Nasdaq composite eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, but backed off the 10,000 level, after rising as much as 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 eased 0.6%. Volume was heavy, partly due to options expiration, resulting in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The Nasdaq saw classic [stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) action.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP061920-240x300.jpg)The Dow Jones got resistance at the 200-day moving average the past week, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index is still below its 200-day moving average. They're the two weakest of the major indexes at this point. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are doing the heavy lifting for now. The weekly chart of the S&P 500 shows a nice test of the 10-week moving average.


With growth stocks acting so well and a light distribution count, there's still plenty to like about the confirmed uptrend.


Stock Market Movers

But buyable charts seem to present themselves on a daily basis.


It looked like **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) was going to complete a flat base by Friday's close, but it spurted to a new high, soaring 9% to 131.77. Wingstop was featured in Friday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wingstop-stock-breaks-out-past-buy-point-after-delivery-boost-coronavirus/).

Retailer **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)), which has been holding gains after gapping up May 21 on strong earnings, cleared a trend line Friday, giving an alternate entry.


**Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)), meanwhile, rose to the top of a eight-week consolidation, rising 5% to 201.53. It's on breakout watch as it sits just below a 203.95 entry.


**West Pharmaceuticals** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), a member of the [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) watchlist, is now forming a flat base with a 222.06 buy point.

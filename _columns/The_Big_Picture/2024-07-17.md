For days, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 remained undisturbed even as major tech stocks weakened on the stock market. All that ended abruptly Wednesday.




The two indexes became unmoored from the uptrends that took both to record highs this month. Semiconductor, software and other technology sectors led the selling. That included the [Magnificent Seven megacaps](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) that have shouldered much of the indexes' gains this year.


By Wednesday's close, the Magnificent Seven had collectively lost $1.128 trillion in market cap over the last five trading days, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That's the largest five-day market-cap loss since May 2022.


**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) flashed a [couple of sell signals](https://www.investors.com/research/meta-stock-sell-signals/). The stock slid 6% below its 50-day moving average in heavy trading and is more than 7% below its 514.01 buy point from the most recent breakout. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) fell 2.6% and closed slightly below its 50-day line as gloom in major techs overshadowed a [successful Prime Day event](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-prime-day-kicks-off-with-7-2-billion-in-e-commerce-spending-adobe/).


The Nasdaq plummeted 2.8% and closed below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since May 2. The S&P 500 sold off 1.4% but held above its 21-day line as financials, energy and some other sectors gave it some lift.


The Trouble With Chips
----------------------


No sector was hit worse than chips in Wednesday's stock market action. The PHLX Semiconductor Index plunged 6.8% in its worst day since March 18, 2020, back in the thick of the Covid-19 panic. The index, however, held above its 50-day moving average.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP071724.jpg)Chips got hit from multiple sides. The Biden administration is considering further restrictions on even the smallest use of U.S. chip technology in foreign-made products, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-17/us-considers-tougher-trade-rules-against-companies-in-chip-crackdown-on-china?sref=FwsjHXQj).


Further, Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump told Bloomberg BusinessWeek that Taiwan should pay for U.S. military protection. **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) slid 8%.


Moreover, **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) gave [a disappointing sales outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/asml-stock-q2-2024-earnings-report/), sending shares down 12.7% in the highest volume since its Jan. 24 earnings rally.


Stock Market Exposure Lowered
-----------------------------


The large declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, combined with higher volume, gave each of the indexes a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). That's five for the S&P 500, although they are fairly well spaced apart over the past five weeks. The Nasdaq has two distribution days.


Wednesday marked a change in character for the stock market. And because the important tech sector saw more damage, IBD reduced its recommended exposure level to 60%-80%. It had been at the most bullish 80%-100% level for six weeks.


Investors should reduce their stock holdings, and right now there's no better place to start than semiconductors and other techs. Any stock that breaks a support level or falls more than 7% from a buy point should be sold with haste. **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), for example, tumbled 10.5% as it closed below the 50-day line in big volume.


The IBD 50 index was hammered 3.8% Wednesday, with most of the damage at the hands of techs such as **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), down 9.6%, and **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)), off 13%.


Stock Market Loses Important Pillar
-----------------------------------


With a broad sell-off in tech stocks, the stock market uptrend that began in November is losing its most important pillar. Even after Wednesday's losses, the S&P 500 Technology and Communications Services sectors are up about 17% year to date.


But the reason the major indexes had not felt the pain was because many other sectors rotated to become the market leaders.


Investor's Business Daily's tracking of 52-week highs and lows — which excludes [EPS Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) below 60 — has been anything but bearish. Since last Thursday, new highs on the New York Stock Exchange have averaged more than 300 a day while 52-week lows have been in single digits. Nasdaq new highs Tuesday totaled 463, the most in at least 12 months. In the past week too, new highs still dwarf new lows on the Nasdaq.


Investors — more confident that the first interest-rate cut will happen in September — quickly pivoted to housing, financial, health care and other sectors.


Indeed, the latest batch of breakouts in the [MarketSurge 250](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) index are in those sectors. Some examples: **Axos Financial** ([AX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AX)) is 13% above a 63 buy point. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is up 7% from its breakout. Homebuilder **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)) is 8% above its 74.66 entry.


Thus, handling the current stock market is not so much about seeking cover, but moving into the emerging opportunities. Investors would do well to check those areas for the next buying opportunities. [Stocks on the Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=up) and [New Highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jul-16-2024/) are two screens where breakouts can be found.


Dow, Small Caps Lead Market
---------------------------


In terms of indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to outperform Wednesday. It posted a 0.6% gain to a record high. Wednesday was the first time since April 14, 1999, that the Dow rose on the same day the S&P 500 fell more than 1%.


Besides a favorable mix of components that dampens the impact of techs, the Dow got some help from a few components. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) expanded its earnings rally to a new high. **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) jumped after [beating second-quarter estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/johnson-johnson-stock-johnson-johnson-earnings-q2-2024/). And **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) broke out of a flat base.


Small caps — the Russell 2000 fell 1% Wednesday — also are new stock market leaders.


Just like iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund broke out of a base last week, other small-cap indexes also have topped buy points. Invesco S&P Small Cap Financials ([PSFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSFC)) is up about 14% since July 9.


Further, Invesco S&P Small Cap Health Care ([PSCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCH)), Invesco S&P Small Cap Industrial ([PSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCI)) and Invesco S&P Small Cap Materials ([PSCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCM)) are others that broke out.

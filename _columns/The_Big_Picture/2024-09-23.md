  Midcaps, Sector Indexes Lead Stock Market Advance; These AI Stocks Power Higher

The [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) may not be performing as fabulously as Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Shohei Ohtani. Yet most indexes performed well on Monday. Small caps struggled, but perhaps they deserved a break after recent gains.




The star in the stock market on Monday? One could make a case for the "minor" indexes.


The S&P MidCap 400 rallied 0.5%. This follows terrific back-to-back weekly rallies of 3.2% and 2.3%. At 3,119, the midcap gauge is getting quite close to surpassing an all-time high of 3,143.02 set more than six weeks ago.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Meanwhile, two sector averages related to the Dow Jones family of indexes did a little better. Amid a growing expectation that the AI industry is going to require a ton of electricity to continue growing, power utility stocks flexed some muscle on Monday. As a result, the Dow utility average rose 0.7%. And despite a wicked fall by **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) following earnings last week, the Dow transportation average rallied 0.8%.


The Dow transports, up 0.8%, halted a one-day sell-off at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


These three indexes all did better than the marquee benchmarks of the stock market.


The Nasdaq composite, getting a partial boost from at least four of the [Magnificent Seven megacap growth firms](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/), edged 0.1% higher. It hit an intraday high of 18,021 but closed below the millennium mark. The S&P 500 added 0.3% on Monday after surging ahead 4% and 1.4% in the two prior weeks, respectively. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed nearly 0.2% higher.


Volume cratered on both main exchanges vs. Friday, when both weekly and monthly options on stocks and indexes expired.


Not Quite Ohtani Numbers, Yet
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP092324--218x300.jpg)The Dow Jones industrials, according to Dow Jones Data, on Monday notched not only a record closing price. The 30-stock blue chip index also posted its 30th record close in 2024 so far. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 recorded its 40th record close of 2024. At 5,718, it's jumped nearly 20% year to date.


The records by those stock market averages may pale vs. what Ohtani accomplished during his six-for-six at-bat performance against the hapless Miami Marlins last Thursday. During that game, the Japanese superstar pitcher-cum-slugger made MLB history by hitting 50 home runs and stealing 50 bases in a single season.


Yet, market action continues to tell IBD readers that fund managers continue to accumulate stock.


The recent moves also follow what is typically a positive factor for the stock market.


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also made it clear during a news conference that the central bank is ready to take further action in monetary easing so that the economy does not slide.


Bond Yields And The Stock Market
--------------------------------


So, why did yields on the long-dated Treasuries rise in recent days?


Keep in mind that yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond had already been falling swiftly ahead of the [FOMC meeting last Tuesday and Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-start-sp-500-jerome-powell/). At 3.74%, it still reflects a much lower cost of money than in April this year (the 10-year bond yielded 4.73% then) and in late October 2023 (4.99%).


[Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the Nasdaq total six within the past 25 trading days. Is that a concern for the stock market? Yes and no.


Yes, because the number itself is high. You'd prefer to see the stock market indexes gain a distribution day or two infrequently. Profit-taking is a normal act of behavior on Wall Street. However, the "quality" of heavy selling, usually marked by distribution days, has been absent lately.


Last week, IBD spotted a small cluster of distribution days. Yet a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) (in which the Nasdaq rose 0.2% but finished well of session highs) on Sept. 17, a 0.3% decline on Sept. 18, and a 0.4% drop on Friday that saw volume explode on quadruple witching, do not fit the mold of huge institutions flooding the stock market exits.


Watch The Count
---------------


The following distribution days certainly showed more bite. Whether they exit due to a strong rally or due to time passed will be noted in this column:


* Aug. 22: Nasdaq falls 1.7%
* Aug. 28: Nasdaq down 1.1%
* Aug. 29: Nasdaq off 0.2%


AI-related plays continue to attract fresh investor capital.


Growing Again
-------------



A few days after announcing a long-range nuclear power supply deal at Three Mile Island with AI technology and cloud computing innovator **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) added 0.8%. At one point Constellation Energy gained as much as 6.6%. Shares gapped out of a four-month base with a 236.30 [standard buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Constellation is part of IBD's alternative energy industry group. Energy sector peer **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)), a member of the electric utility industry group, rose 3.5% in heavy volume to 111.63. The stock moved further past a [trendline entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trendlines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) near 89.


Meanwhile, **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) edged 0.4% higher on news that it is mulling plans to expand its semiconductor manufacturing capacity by investing in the Middle East. Chip foundries need tons of water to operate. Perhaps that's one reason why **Aris Water** ([ARIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARIS)), which provides water to domestic plants, spurted 3.3% higher in above-average turnover on Monday.


The small cap is trying to clear a new base at 17.91. Shares have more than doubled since bottoming at 7.22 in December.

The stock market took a step backward Monday after rallying sharply off lows Friday.




After a stronger-than-expected jobs report Friday, the ISM Services index also topped expectations Monday, rising to 56.5 from 54.4 in October. Economists expected a drop to 53.5. Meanwhile, factory orders rose 1% in October, higher than the expectations for a 0.7% rise. Two more strong economic reports fueled fears that the Federal Reserve still has lot of room to bring down inflation.


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.9% and could be poised for a test of the 11,000 level. The S&P 500 breached the 4000 level, giving back 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped below the 34,000 level, falling 1.4%.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq and higher volume on the NYSE. That gave the S&P 500 another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Declining stocks on the Nasdaq beat winners by nearly 3-to-1. Losers beat winners on the NYSE by just over 6-to-1.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) weighed on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. After jumping 6.6% last week, Tesla fell 6.4% Monday after Reuters reported that the company plans to [cut production](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-drops-after-sales-record-in-china-prompt-production-cut/) by up to 20% at its Shanghai plant as early as this week. But Tesla denied the report.


Meanwhile, small-cap **Harmonic** ([HLIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLIT)) flashed a sell signal with a sharp break of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Shares crashed 10.7%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small-cap and midcap stocks fared the worst. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slumped below its 200-day moving average, falling nearly 2.8%, and the SPDR Midcap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) gave back 2.5%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MP_1x2_120522-250x300.jpg)All 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with consumer discretionary, energy and financials under the most pressure.


Inside the S&P 500, **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)), **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)) and **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) closed with losses of around 7%.


Bond yields rose Monday, weighing on sentiment. A rising U.S. dollar didn't help matters. The 10-year yield was trading around 3.59% just after the market close, up 9 basis points. The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) firmed up at its 200-day moving average, rising 0.8%.


The stock market had every reason to sell off Friday after the [November jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-wage-growth-jumps-amid-strong-hiring-dow-jones-november-2022/) did nothing to calm the Federal Reserve's concerns about a red-hot labor market. But the Nasdaq composite pared a 1.6% early loss to -0.2%, while the S&P 500 shaved a 1.2% loss to -0.1%. The 10-year Treasury yield rallied up to 3.64% Friday before reversing lower.


But Monday's session showed that sellers are still around as Wall Street worries that the Fed's efforts to bring inflation down could spark a long, drawn out recession as opposed to a soft landing for the U.S. economy.


Keep Exposure Light
-------------------


While defense is still better than offense at this point, the stock market is still in confirmed uptrend. That means it's OK to look for stocks to buy, but keep positions small to start, while keeping your overall exposure light. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), for example, is less than 60% invested at this point.


Oil and gas stocks outperformed early as oil prices surged again. But after hitting an intraday high of $82.72 a barrel, oil reversed lower and settled at $76.93 a barrel, down 3.8%. Over the weekend, OPEC+ decided to stick to its existing policy of reducing oil production by 2 million barrels a day through 2023.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


In the oil and gas sector, **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) slumped 5.3%, halting a four-session win streak. Headed into Monday, the stock was closing in a cup-with-handle buy point.


Among oil and gas producers in the S&P 500, **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) ended with losses of 3.5% and 3.8%. EOG stock fell sharply to its 50-day line, and Pioneer reversed lower after making a bid to reclaim its 200-day line early in the session.


Among the day's movers, **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) topped a 45.67 buy point but closed below that entry. Shares still rose 2.6% in higher volume. Sentiment was positive after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight.

New issue **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) scored its second straight new high after clearing an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) Friday. But shares reversed lower for a loss of 1.4%.


The stock is prone to volatile price swings. In the current stock market environment, breakouts have been a mixed bag at best. For every breakout that works, there seem to be plenty of others that struggle.


China stocks soared early in the session as more cities in China eased Covid-19 restrictions. Buy many pared early gains, including **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), which tried to poke above its 200-day line but a gain of just over 3% faded to a gain of 0.5% by the close.


Allegro Stock's Chart
---------------------


Be careful to chase stocks that might still look like they're in a buy zone.


In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), chipmaker **Allegro Microsystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) offers a good example.


On the daily chart, Allegro gapped up over a handle buy point of 32.07. There's no handle on the weekly chart, however. After seven straight up weeks, the stock may be ready to pull back.


Watch to see if the stock can form a handle on its weekly chart in the form of at least one down week. As Allegro approaches its recent high, there's a good chance it could form a handle on the weekly chart.

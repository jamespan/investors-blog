  Dow Leads Stock Market Rally; Twitter Slumps On User Growth Fears

If you thought the Nasdaq composite's 1.3% move higher Friday was counterintuitive, you probably thought the Dow Jones' 1.3% gain Monday was equally counterintuitive.




If there's one sure thing about the stock market, it always seems to do what is least expected.


U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports took effect Friday, while North Korea over the weekend criticized a "gangster-like" U.S. attitude after talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.


What's the market's message? Well, it's not overly concerned that a trade war between China and the U.S. will be long and drawn out and have a negative impact on worldwide economic growth.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MP070918.jpg)Instead, the market seems to be more focused on a healthy U.S. economy and the prospects for a solid second-quarter earnings season, which kicks off Friday with reports due from **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)).


Strong results from the financials could provide additional lift for the major stock indexes.


Dow Jones Leads The Way
-----------------------


The Dow Jones outperformed Monday, rising 1.3%. The two Dow components perhaps most vulnerable to a trade war with China fared the best. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) rose 4% and 2%, respectively.


JPMorgan and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were also top performers in the Dow, with gains of around 3%.


The Dow Jones poked above its 50-day moving average, but it's still below the psychologically important 25,000 level, a potential resistance level to watch.


Financials were strong across the board Monday with superregional banks leading the way. Inside the group, **SunTrust** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) name **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) and **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)) ended with gains of at least 3%.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite picked up almost 0.9% each. The Russell small-cap index rose 0.6%. It closed within 4 points of its all-time intraday high of 1708. The IBD 50 turned in another solid showing, up 1.1%, while utilities lagged badly.


Volume on the Nasdaq came in higher than Friday's level, while preliminary data showed volume also rising on the NYSE.


Transports Attract Buyers
-------------------------


The Dow Jones Transportation average outperformed, rising 2.1%. The index reclaimed its 50-day moving average after finding support at the 200-day line. The most impressive move in the sector came from railroad stocks. **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)) gapped up and closed above its 50-day moving average. Shares jumped 3.4%.



The Nasdaq's technical health continues to improve after Monday's higher-volume gain. It recently found support at the 50-day moving average, and its advance/decline line is in new high ground as the index sits just below its all-time high.


Meanwhile, some growth stocks hit by selling recently are showing renewed signs of life. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), for example, **Kemet** ([KEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEM)) cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 26.43 alternate-handle buy point, soaring more than 6% and getting as high as 28.41. The breakout came after the stock flashed a sell signal from a prior handle buy point of 25.79.


Breakouts Or Pullbacks To Support?
----------------------------------



Despite Kemet's strong move Monday, it remains a tricky environment for technical breakouts.


Take **Stitch Fix** ([SFIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFIX)), which reversed lower Monday after Friday's breakout. A 4% intraday gain faded to a 4% loss by the close


Recent IPO **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)), meanwhile, faded after clearing an aggressive entry at 35.29. The stock rose 4.5% to 35.60 but ended near its session low.


In the current market, buying high-quality names after successful pullbacks to the 10-week moving average probably makes more sense than buying base breakouts at this point.


Inside the IBD 50, China-based **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) is trading near its 10-week line for the first time after a breakout. Same with **Seacoast Banking** ([SBCF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBCF)), [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)).


[Buying base breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) can still be a profitable endeavor, as long as you're buying a leading stock in a leading industry group with plenty of liquidity — not a lagging stock that's just now getting around to breaking out.


The stock market held up quite well despite a sell-off in shares of **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)). The stock plunged more than 5% on reports the company suspended or shut down as many as [70 million fake or suspicious accounts](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-user-accounts/) since May.

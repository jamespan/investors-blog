Software stocks were taken to the woodshed in the stock market Tuesday as a wave of selling knocked the Nasdaq composite to a loss of nearly 1.7% by the close. Losers outnumbered winners on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1, and buyers came in during the final 30 minutes of trading.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the index its second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


The Nasdaq fell below its 10-day moving average, but a late-session bounce helped the index hold support at its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were a drag on the Nasdaq 100, along with a large number of software stocks, including **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)).


CrowdStrike slumped 5.2% during the regular session but held support at its 50-day average. Shares soared more than 20% in extended trading after the company reported strong earnings and raised its fiscal 2025 outlook.


MongoDB slid below its 50-day line. The company announces earnings Thursday after the close.

Sentiment was weak early, hurt by premarket declines for Tesla and Apple. Tesla came under pressure after the company had to evacuate its manufacturing plant in Berlin due to a nearby fire. An environmental group opposed to Tesla's plant expansion [took credit for the blaze](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-berlin-factory-halted-due-to-power-outage-4e2c1eca?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D00937973674102209704254767994372579554%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1709676286).


And sellers hit Apple hard after a report from Counterpoint Research noted that [iPhone sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-drops-on-china-iphone-sales-woes/) slumped 24% in China during the first six weeks of 2024. Tesla and Apple have been on downtrends since December.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 fell 1% and closed near its 10-day line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 1% but closed below its 21-day line for the first time since Jan. 17. After a downside reversal Monday, the Russell 2000 ended down 1%. But the small-cap index held above its 10-day line.


In the S&P 500, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) slumped below its 50-day line, falling 4.6% in heavy volume. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock has been a solid performer since its addition to the Leaders list on Oct. 31.


Volume fell on the NYSE and breadth was pretty good, with decliners beating advancers by about 4-to-3.

All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday and Thursday as he gives his Semiannual Monetary Report to Congress. He'll be in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday and a Senate committee on Thursday.


The 10-year Treasury yield hit an intraday low of 4.11%. By late afternoon, it was trading around 4.14%, down 8 basis points. The 10-year yield came close to a test of its 50-day line near 4.10%.


According to federal funds futures tracking at [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), there's about a 70% chance that the first interest-rate cut will come at the June Fed meeting.


After Powell's testimony, the February jobs report looms large on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by 190,000 after a blowout jobs number in January that saw nonfarm payrolls surge by 353,000, nearly double the consensus estimate. Wage growth was also stronger than expected.


What To Do Now
--------------


Headed into Tuesday, IBD's recommended invested percentage was 60% to 80%. It'll stay there for now, although leaning toward the 60% side probably makes more sense than 80% as distribution days start to proliferate on the Nasdaq.


The Leaderboard model portfolio is currently about 67% invested after we trimmed the ServiceNow position Tuesday. The move comes after we trimmed **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) Monday and added **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) as a new half position. As of Tuesday, a full position in Leaderboard was equal to about an 8.6% weighting.

Actionable setups have been sparse for a while now because of so many extended stocks. Keep in mind that the Nasdaq composite is up in 16 of the past 18 weeks.


After lengthy uptrends, big stock market leaders like **Celestica** ([CLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLS)), **Modine Manufacturing** ([MOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOD)) and **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)) have crossed [upper channel lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-channel-lines-for-sell-signals/), indicating their runs may be nearing an end.


Regional Banks, Energy Emerging
-------------------------------


The good thing about stock market pullbacks is that they do allow for leading stocks to pause and catch their breath. Pullbacks can also usher in new leadership.



Regional banks outperformed again, with the superregional group up more than 2%. That's after a strong showing Monday that saw the group jump 2.9%. Fifth Third joined Leaderboard on Monday, when it gave an early buy signal. FITB shares broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) Tuesday with a 35.73 entry.


Money has also been rotating into select oil and gas stocks. In the field services group, **Tidewater** ([TDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDW)) broke out powerfully Friday from an eight-week consolidation. In the machinery and equipment group, **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) is near the top of the 5% buy zone after a topping a 102.65 entry in strong volume Feb. 21.

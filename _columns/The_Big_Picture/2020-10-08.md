The major stock indexes ended with modest gains Thursday, as the stock market added to Wednesday's strong gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced as much as 0.7% before trimming gains.




The Nasdaq closed 0.5% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%. The S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with advances of 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.


Leading growth stocks were barely higher, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) moved up less than 0.1%. In the IBD 50, **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) advanced 2.8% apiece. Pool is [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pool-stock-clears-buy-point-stay-at-home-trend-fuels-growth/), as it breaks out above a 338.98 buy point. Lam is running up the right side of a cup base, as it retakes its 50-day line.


Volume was squarely lower on the Nasdaq and and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Continues
----------------------------


After [last week's bullish action](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/), the stock market rally remains in a confirmed, albeit slow-going, uptrend. The Dow triggered a follow-through day on Sept. 30. Since then, the three major indexes have made modest progress.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP_100820-254x300.jpg)From the close of trade on Sept. 30, the Dow Jones industrials is up 2.3%. The Nasdaq is up 2.3%, while the S&P 50 is up 2.5%.


With just one distribution day on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the uptrend has yet to see much institutional selling. Still, there hasn't been a bullish follow-through day on the Nasdaq, this year's leading index. While there has been strong price action, the lack of volume prevented the conclusive trend-change signal from occurring.


Investors are still cleared to buy breakout stocks. For now, continue to keep purchases small and slowly build up exposure, as more and more top stocks break out. If this uptrend is real and meaningful, there will be plenty of time for new breakouts to emerge. Many stocks are now in buy zones.


The best candidates are those that held up the best during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with [strong relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). These ideas could become stock market leaders.

Breakout Update: Beyond Meat, Domino's, Fastly, Twilio
------------------------------------------------------


How breakouts fare during new uptrends can help indicate the underlying health of the stock market. There are some early winners but also some flops.


On the upside, **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) are solidly above their recent buy points.


Beyond Meat ended Thursday more than 15% beyond the 167.26 entry in a cup base, following a breakout on Sept. 29. Shares rose 2.2% Thursday. Twilio is just out of buy range past a 283.44 entry in a double bottom. Shares edged 0.3% higher Thursday.


On the downside, **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) are having trouble.


Domino's Pizza [reported that earnings rose](https://www.investors.com/news/dominos-pizza-earnings-q3-dominos-stock/) 21.5% to $2.49 a share, missing consensus estimates for $2.75. Revenue grew nearly 18% to $967.72 million, topping the $945.59 million consensus. Domino's stock stumbled 7% Thursday, falling sharply below its 424.82 buy point in a flat base. Shares closed below their 50-day line.


[Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/fastly-stock-nears-buy-point-online-services-seek-speed/), Fastly, fell out of the 5% buy zone above a 117.89 buy point in a consolidation base.

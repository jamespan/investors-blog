Bear Market Takes Another Hit On Inflation News; This Seasoned Investing Pro Targets 2 Key Tech Sectors
========================================================================================================

The [bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/bear-market-news-and-how-to-handle-a-market-correction/) has thrived this year for two big reasons: inflation and the Fed. Yet by the looks of Wednesday's action, a new theme — stock reflation — may be building.




A [smaller than expected jump in the cost of goods and services](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-finally-falling-the-good-and-bad-news-for-the-dow-jones/) at the consumer level in July sparked strong buying from the opening bell.


Not surprisingly, the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 dominated the bullish picture painted by stocks with gains of 2.9% and 3%, respectively. They represent companies that tend to deliver more growth. Yet blue chip indexes fared well, too. The S&P 500 romped 2.1% higher. At 4210, it's now rallied 7.6% since a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on June 24.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%. It cleared resistance near 33,200, an area that it struggled to overcome from May 31 to June 8.


Volume was mixed, down 3% on the Nasdaq vs. Tuesday but rising sharply on the NYSE.


Up Next: Producer Prices
------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP081022-195x300.jpg)Stocks could still show more volatility on Thursday, when the July producer price index report arrives. Yet for now, Wednesday's movement in long-dated U.S. Treasuries proved refreshingly calm. The yield on the key 10-year note edged 1 basis point lower to 2.78%, still down a lot from a 3.48% peak on June 14.


The probability of a third rate hike of 75 basis points at the next Federal Reserve meeting in late September plunged to 42.5%, according to CME trading data. That's down from 68% on Tuesday.


For sure, rallies after a correction that exceeds 20% to 30% can be bumpy. The end of 2002 to early 2003 may offer a nice example to study. And the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 showed how it can take years for investor confidence to return. So even after Wednesday's thrilling up day, it pays to keep a cool head.


"One encouraging CPI report does not constitute a new and durable inflation trend," Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, with $45 billion in assets under management, commented in an email sent to IBD. "With core CPI still growing at a near 6% clip on an annual basis, it's far from mission accomplished on returning to the Fed's preferred target range on inflation."


Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)), sounded a little more upbeat on the data.


"Although real risks remain for businesses and consumer alike, the Fed may be able to navigate a soft landing," Roach wrote in a comment sent to clients and IBD. "One such risk is the upward trend in initial unemployment claims. The other risk is slowing orders for capital equipment."


Meanwhile, others believe July's report marks an important first step toward a gradual return to 2%-level inflation sometime next year.


Bear Market Today: The Next Move For Your Portfolio
---------------------------------------------------


And so when it comes to the portfolio, you do not have to plunge into stocks headfirst. More economic news and actions and comments by Federal Reserve bankers could lead to mini-corrections within the big correction.


Nonetheless, the air in the stock market is giving off a fresher scent. Notable improvements in the technical landscape should not get ignored.


For starters, heading into Wednesday's session, the NYSE's advance-decline had already ascended to its highest level since April. On Wednesday, early data showed winners on the Big Board outmatch losers by easily more than a 5-1 margin. On the Nasdaq, advancers bested decliners by 7 to 2.


The new highs data may make investors feel like the gas tank for growth stocks is still well below half-full. Yet as the Market Pulse shows, more [CAN SLIM-quality](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) names are rising in heavy turnover. Such gains, over time, help set up new breakouts.


Speaking of stocks and recent breakouts, while a few in various industries have backpedaled, others have shown encouraging moves.


They range from the highly speculative biotech **PTC Therapeutics** ([PTCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTCT)) (no earnings, but huge sales growth) to **Teekay Tankers** ([TNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNK)), an energy and transport play.



The former built a 3-1/2 month cup that featured an ultratight handle and a 45.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


You have to simply admire how the [handle formed so tightly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/). Such action signaled an unwillingness among fund managers to unload the stock in a big way, even after the small cap made a torrid run of 20 points from its 25.01 base low in a four-week span.


Teekay, meanwhile, did not join in on the bear market rally Wednesday. Yet a 1.8% decline did not severely dent the solid gains since the provider of global oil and petroleum product transportation pushed past a 22.20 entry point in an eight-week cup without handle.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has moved into new high ground, another plus.


Putting An End To The Bear Market: Watch This Development
---------------------------------------------------------



At 12,854, the Nasdaq still lies more than 20% below its all-time peak of 16,212. So, technically, tech stocks remain in bear market territory.


What could also help the index shed its gloomy disposition?


One, watch to see how it handles a potential future test of the 200-day moving average.


Two, you could draw a trendline that connects the 16,212 peak of Nov. 22 with the March 29 high of 14,646. If the Nasdaq reaches 13,000, that would form a third point in which to draw a trendline. Can the Nasdaq break this chain of lower highs and lower lows?


Most tech companies have already posted second-quarter results. The Nasdaq does have a heavy dose of retail companies, too, so upcoming reports could also contribute to future progress.


Investment Pro: Eye These Tech Areas
------------------------------------


But in the longer term, investment manager Sumit Handa thinks investors should stay focused on new opportunities in two key areas of technology: cloud computing and cybersecurity.


The biggest giants in the cloud computing space appear to stay on track to grow business at an annual rate of 30% or more. Order backlog at Amazon Web Services remains full to the brim. In an economy that preliminary figures show had a second straight quarter of contraction, this cannot be ignored.


"We like the cloud and think it's a great place to deploy capital," Handa, managing director and co-head of the investment committee at Pennington Partners ($1.5 billion in assets), told IBD. Handa previously served as CIO for the city of Philadelphia. "There definitely will be growth in anything related to infrastructure related to the cloud as well."



As for cybersecurity, Handa says it's no coincidence that key government websites in Taiwan got attacked during the historic visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other key officials. The Ukraine-Russia war is being fought as intensely in cyberspace as it is on the ground.


No wonder, then, that some airplay on Wednesday's IBD Live show got devoted to companies including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)).

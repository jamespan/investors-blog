===================================================

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq got hit with another day of unequivocal distribution Wednesday, prompting a shift in outlook to uptrend under pressure.

  

The S&P 500 took the hardest hit, falling 1.4%. The Dow lost 1.1% and the Nasdaq gave up 0.9%. The Nasdaq popped more than 1% early, helped by strong earnings from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), but gave back the entire gain in the morning. It recovered for a bit early in the afternoon, but selling accelerated into the close, picking up after the Fed's policy statement.

  

NYSE volume increased 22% from Tuesday. Nasdaq volume rose 11%.

  

A market uptrend under pressure means the odds are less in your favor for making money in stocks. The goal is to swim with the market tide, not against it. The market tide isn't exactly flowing positive now, which means defense is the best course of action.

  

Despite two signs of strength by the Nasdaq — one on Jan. 8, the other on Jan. 22 — major averages are having a hard time making headway. The choppy action has been frustrating for the bulls, but it's no surprise because the market has a lot on its plate right now.

  

Earnings fears, falling oil prices, the health of the U.S. economy and the timing of an interest rate hike by the Fed are all front and center on investors' minds.

  

The conclusion of the two-day FOMC meeting came and went without much fanfare. The Fed maintained its tone that it will remain patient in deciding when to raise interest rates. It characterized job growth as "strong" and said inflation should increase over the medium term as the labor market improves.

  

The jury is still out concerning the timetable for the first interest rate hike. Many think the Fed will move in June, but others speculate it will be later in the year as falling oil and a strong dollar keep a lid on inflation.

  

Meanwhile, the latest survey of market newsletters from Investors Intelligence showed bulls increasing to 53.1% last week from 49%. That's potentially good news for the bear camp because it's a contrarian indicator. The bull percentage still has a ways to go before it raises a red flag. Readings at 60% or higher have preceded several market tops.

  

The action in individual growth stocks was dismal. Apple jumped 5%, but closed well off its session highs.

  

Apple suppliers such as **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) also gave back early gains.

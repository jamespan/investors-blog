Stock Market Rallies With 10-Year Treasury Yield; Roku, Upwork Close In On Buy Points
======================================================================================

The stock market closed out the week with bullish gains in lower volume, led by financial, energy and materials stocks. Sentiment was positive as money flowed out of bonds and into stocks. The 10-year yield snapped a sharp weekly decline, rising 7 basis points to 1.36%.




The risk-on trade was in full force in the stock market Friday as several leading growth stocks scored bullish gains. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) perked up after a rough week. It rose 2% but still fell 2.3% for the week. **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) was a top gainer in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks, up nearly 8%. After another test of its 50-day moving average, the stock broke out over a trendline, giving an aggressive entry.


IBD 50 stock **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) also outperformed in the IBD 50, up 2%. It's getting support at the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/), putting the stock in an alternate buy zone. Outside of the IBD 50, group peer **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) cleared a trendline and closed just below a 177.68 handle entry.

Oil and gas producer **Cimarex Energy** ([XEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XEC)) added 3% to 74.14. It's in position for a breakout try over a 75.02 buy point.


Small Caps Lead Stock Market Rally
----------------------------------


The Russell 2000 led the charge, up 2.2% after a four-day slide. It closed above its 50-day line after giving up the support level Wednesday. **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) was a big winner in the small-cap index, up 64%, on news it's being acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for around $6.6 billion.

The S&P 500 rallied to another new high, up 1.1%, helped by a strong showing from the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)), which jumped 2.9%. Seven of the fund's top-10 holdings [report earnings next week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/tsm-stock-consolidates-trades-near-key-support-level-ahead-of-quarterly-results/), including **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)).


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was well below Thursday's levels. Breadth was pretty good, with advancing stocks beating decliners on the Nasdaq by more than 3-to-1. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by nearly 5-to-1.


Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan were top performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, helping the blue-chip index to a gain of 1.3%. The Dow closed above Monday's high and looks ready to make another run at the 35,000 level.


Light Distribution
------------------


The S&P 500 marked a distribution day Thursday, but Thursday's rally off lows for the major stock indexes and more gains on Friday show that buyers are still around. The uptrend is still very much intact. The Nasdaq composite only shows two distribution days. One was a mild stalling session on Wednesday. The other was on June 15 when the index fell 0.7% in higher volume.


The Nasdaq composite marked another all-time closing high, rising 1%. But it's starting to look extended again at 5.6% above its 50-day moving average. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) closed out the week 6.6% above its 50-day line.


After Thursday's upside reversal, **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) added 2.7%. It's forming a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), along with **Upwork** ([UPWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPWK)), which jumped 4.5%.

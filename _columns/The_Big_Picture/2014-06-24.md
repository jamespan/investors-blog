A promising start to Tuesday's session turned sour by the close as attention shifted from better-than-expected economic data to renewed tension in Iraq.


The result was a distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


After rising 0.7% early and hitting its highest level since April 2000, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%. The S&P 500 shed 0.6%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Monday's below-average levels. The IBD 50 gave up 1%.


Stocks shrugged off hawkish comments from Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser.


He said the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve was too passive and that the Fed might have to raise rates before the end of the year.


In economic news, one day after May existing-home sales topped forecasts, new-home sales rose to the highest level in six years. Sales jumped 18.6% to 504,000 units, well ahead of the consensus estimate of 441,000.


Meanwhile, the Conference Board's confidence index hit 85.2 in June, up from a revised 82.2 in May. The latest reading was the highest since January 2008.


IBD's homebuilders' industry group was one of the day's top performers, rising about 1%. Group leader **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) rose 1% ahead of its earnings report set for Thursday before the open.


The distribution day count in today's Market Pulse remains contained, but Tuesday's session was a bearish one no matter how you slice it.


While it's not the time to get overly bearish and raise cash too quickly, it is the time to assess current holdings. If you've got a 15% gainer since the May 27 follow-through, there's nothing wrong with taking at least some profits. But if you're holding on to some middling performers, getting rid of dead weight is a sound strategy.


Energy stocks took a hit, particularly oil and gas producers. Keep in mind that going into Tuesday, the group ranked No. 2 out of 197 groups based on six-month price performance. It might've just been plain old profit-taking as several extended, large-cap names in the group like **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), **Pioneer Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)), **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) fell sharply.


Breakout attempts for **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) didn't get very far. Facebook briefly cleared a buy point of 66.57, but volume ended up only average. It closed near its low but still rose 0.5%.


Baidu, meanwhile, cleared a handle area. Shares rose 2% in solid volume, ending just above a 179.60 entry. Earlier this month, Baidu cleared an earlier handle buy point of 170.89.

  Stocks Perk Up Late But Another Magnificent Seven Stock Starts To Slip

The stock market jumped in the final 45 minutes of trading Tuesday as investors prepared for the next inflation report from the Labor Department. But Magnificent Seven player **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which has practically spearheaded the AI rally, showed weakness.




Tuesday's late surge was nearly the opposite reaction of a morning slide in the major indexes. The Nasdaq composite was down as much as 0.7% but closed 0.3% higher. The S&P 500 gained 0.1% after wiping out a 0.8% decline. Notably, both closed above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which has served as a guide of short-term market direction.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a shade lower but also closed near session highs. The Dow is battling its 50-day moving average, and closed slightly below it Tuesday.


Small caps also fared better, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Monday's totals.


The March 4 Nasdaq [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) is no longer counted because more than 25 sessions have passed. Still, the Nasdaq and S&P have a heavy load of distribution days, at seven each.


Stock Market Gets Next Inflation Report Wednesday
-------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP040924.jpg)By Wednesday's opening bell, the stock market could be in a different mood, depending how the March consumer price index comes out. Economists expect prices to rise 0.3% from February and 3.5% on a yearly basis, [according to Econoday](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull?fid=591540&cust=ibd&year=2024&lid=0#top).


Although the stock market wasn't bothered by stronger-than-expected job growth on Friday, the inflation number may matter more for the Federal Reserve. Thierry Wizman, Global FX & Rates strategist at Macquarie, said labor market data could have been interpreted as inflationary or disinflationary.


"The clearer signal comes from direct observation of inflation trends; that's why Wednesday's CPI is much more important," he noted. Wednesday also brings the minutes from the March 20 Fed meeting.


Generally speaking, rising interest rates tend to dampen stock performance. When the 10-year yield moved above 4.4% in late July, the major indexes started to roll over. The stock market didn't bottom until late October, just as the benchmark yield started to come down from a 2007 high near 5%.


Yet the stock market has remained in an uptrend despite a rising trend in Treasury yields this year.


Year to date, the benchmark 10-year note's yield is up 50 basis points and 93 basis points from a year ago, according to Dow Jones Market Data. On Tuesday, the yield climbed nearly 6 basis points to 4.365%. Investors may wonder when that fortuitous trend will snap.


The health of leading stocks says a lot about the broad stock market, and there's a bit of gloom on that front.


IBD 50 ETF Falls Below 50-Day Line
----------------------------------


The IBD 50 index fell 1.1% Tuesday, and is barely above its 50-day moving average. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), however, closed below its 50-day line for the first time since November.



Another one of the stock market's flagship stocks now shows some discomfort. Nvidia slid below its 21-day exponential moving average and is testing the 10-week line for the first time since its run began in January. Its 21-day line is now bending lower. But volume was slightly below average, which suggests institutions were measured in their profit-taking.


Already, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) were two Magnificent Seven stocks showing weak charts.


For now, however, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are still holding up.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) looks the best of the Mag 7 bunch as it trades in the buy zone of a cup base. The company Tuesday [announced an artificial intelligence chip](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-google-cloud-ai-event-palo-alto-cybersecurity-pact/) designed with Arm Holdings' architecture.


While Alphabet also announced an AI chip made with Nvidia technology, the Google parent may grow less reliant on Nvidia for chip designs.


In the IBD 50, **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), **Eaton** ([ETN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETN)), **AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)) and **BBB Foods** ([TBBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBBB)) are other stocks that are acting suspiciously or performing downright poorly.

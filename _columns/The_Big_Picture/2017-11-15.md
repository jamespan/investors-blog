Stocks Fall Again, But Leaders Firm; Why The Market Rally's Future May Lie Here

Equities are a leading indicator. The market leads the economy. Wall Street delivers the news first.


Over the long term, these old saws still ring true in investing. But right now, it feels like the market is waiting for some big news out of Capitol Hill. What will the Republican Party-led tax plan end up including and excluding? And more importantly, can it reach President Trump's desk by Thanksgiving?




Perhaps the uncertainty over this extremely important issue forms the largest part of a backdrop that is putting the market on its heels more so than on the balls of its feet.


The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.5% on Wednesday, cutting an early-morning loss in half. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average more or less followed suit, giving up just a bit more. Small caps matched the decline; the S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.5%.


Nasdaq and NYSE volume fell.

On Wednesday, the government reported a 0.2% year-over-year gain in October consumer prices, matching economists' views. The Fed is targeting 2% inflation as it evaluates new moves to raise the cost of borrowing money. So even though Treasury yields fell, one could interpret the CPI data as a win for the monetary hawks.


If you are a volatility watcher, perhaps you might have thought the equities market was down even harder. The CBOE Market Volatility index, or the VIX, jumped as high as 14.51, hitting a 10-week high. Clearly, options traders are jittery. The put-call volume ratio (see the chart at the bottom of the Nasdaq's chart in the General Market Indicators page) is still rather elevated.


Indeed, the opening minutes of trading painted a bleak view that Congress will pass meaningful tax reform to re-energize the economy. U.S. corporate tax rates are among the highest among nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Large multinationals are refusing to bring back hordes of cash earned overseas. And Republicans still haven't found a way to even chip away at the Affordable Care Act.


An overnight drop in East Asian stock markets didn't help the cause either.


Yet the market did what it usually does in a confirmed uptrend. It started weak, but ended fairly strong.


The unusually high [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count for the Nasdaq is still a concern. But the Nasdaq has overcome such high numbers of days of true institutional selling and managed to climb higher.


One example: On Aug. 17, the Nasdaq chalked up a ninth distribution day over the prior 25 sessions, falling 1.9% to 6221. Just days earlier, IBD downgraded the current outlook for the market to "Uptrend under pressure." But the following week, the major indexes flexed strength. The Nasdaq and the 500 both crossed back above their 50-day moving averages. Leading stocks were doing just fine. And so on Aug. 22, the outlook switched back to "Uptrend resumes."


Since the close of that ninth distribution day on Aug. 17, Nasdaq has now risen nearly 8% to 6707.


Notice, too, how, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 continue to hold well above their 50-day moving averages. That's mud in the eyes of market bears. However, some minor indexes do not have this luxury. TheÂ NYSE composite, Dow transports, Russell 2000 and S&P 600 are all now mildly below their 50-day moving averages.


Leading stocks, meanwhile, are not showing signs of severe selling or intense profit taking. Online auto marketplace **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)) had a failed attempt to clear a narrow IPO base, but fellow new issue and cold weather outfitter **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) is holding up well after bolting past a 21.84 buy point in a fine cup with handle.



CarGurus finished up more than 3% to 31.03, but finished way below a 35.10 base buy point. On Wednesday, shares reached as high as 35.42.


Through Tuesday's close, the [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) showed 16 companies with impressive fundamentals and stock price strength. That's up from three on Jan. 1. Only one of those three is still on the list now: **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)), the mortgage insurance play that is now extended past a 41.54 buy point. (See an annotated daily and weekly chart of Essent at [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx).)


While chip, electronics, building and software stocks continue to do well this year, here is possibly one new sign of sector rotation: only 1 oil group is now in the bottom 20, just 3 in the bottom 40. See the entire list at the bottom of the General Market Indicators page via the link below.

Stock Market Loses Altitude After Optimism Fades; Tesla Retreats; Bond Yields On Fire
======================================================================================

The major stock market indexes gave up overnight gains and lost ground on Wednesday, but losses were limited, except for small caps. After the close, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) sold off on Q3 earnings while perennial underperformer **International Business Machines** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) rallied more than 5%.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% in the heavy session while the S&P 500 shed 0.7%. The Nasdaq underperformed with a 0.8% loss, held down by small caps. The Russell-2000 small-cap index acted poorly all day, closing 1.7% lower.


The market is still working on a rally attempt, despite high volatility and multiple whipsaws in the last week. Investors should watch patiently, from the sidelines if possible, waiting for a decisive sell-off or the elusive [follow-through rally day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


The yield on the 10-year Treasury surged more than 3% to a 14-year high at 4.13%. Psychological support at 4% now looks like a tough level to break.


Daily volume on the Nasdaq fell compared to Tuesday, and preliminary closing data showed lower NYSE volume.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MP101922--257x300.jpg)Crude oil shook off news the Biden administration will release 15 million barrels from the strategic oil reserve, lifting 3.5% to $84.98 per barrel. SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 3% in sympathy with higher energy prices.


Netflix Breaks Out Of Two-Month Base
------------------------------------


Netflix rose more than 13% in Wednesday's stock market after [beating Q3 subscriber estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-jumps-as-video-streamer-returns-to-subscriber-growth/). Positive sentiment ahead of the Nov. 3 ad-tier launch contributed to buying interest but the stock still faces major technical hurdles.


After the Q1 earnings report, NFLX stock fell more than 35% from about 352 to a close at 226.19 on April 20, booking the highest one-day sell volume since 2013. That gap holds massive [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) that could take equal buying pressure to remount.



Wednesday's rally entered the gap, clearing a 252.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), nearly reaching 280. That's still more than 70 points below the closing price at the top of the gap. In addition, morning gains stalled just under the declining [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/), which also marks major resistance.


Bottom line: Netflix needs greater institutional sponsorship to power through the bearish gap, confirmed by [MarketSmith's Fund Ownership Survey](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/marketsmith-institutional-ownership-ibd-mutual-fund-index/). That metric has declined every quarter so far this year.


Tesla Slumps Against High Expectations
--------------------------------------


Tesla fell about 2% in Wednesday's post-market after missing Q3 earnings and revenue estimates by small margins. CEO Elon Musk and his rapidly expanding EV production capacity delivered 343,830 vehicles during the quarter. The company could update delivery guidance at the 5:30 p.m. PT conference call.


TSLA stock has struggled for months in a broad sideways pattern and is now trading at the same level it first reached nearly two years ago. Worries about an economic downturn and erratic China growth have been growing headwinds, aggravated by the zero-Covid policy and its impact on consumer buying power.


Domestic competition is also growing, through **BYD** ([BYDDF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYDDF)) and other Chinese automotive startups.



IBM caught fire on Wednesday evening after beating Q3 estimates and raising its fiscal year revenue growth outlook. It traded higher by more than 4% after hours.


The tech giant, which spun off legacy operations to **Kyndryl Holdings** ([KD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KD)) in October 2021, failed to break nine-year trendline resistance in a summer rally attempt and is trading at the same price level first reached in May 2008.

Stock Market Today
------------------


Dow Jones component **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) rose 3% after Jefferies upgraded the stock market energy giant to buy with a 133 price target.


**United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) added to bullish news in the airline sector, beating Q3 top and bottom line estimates. It now expects Q4 adjusted operating margin to exceed 2019 levels. The U.S. global jets ETF ([JETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JETS)) traded flat but just hit a four-week high.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.7%. Two stocks on today's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stand out at the extremes.



On the upside, **CVR Energy** ([CVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVI)) surged 6.2% and is trading within 4% of the 39.81 buy point in a [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). CVI stock just posted a blue dot on the [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart, signaling a new high on the relative strength line.


On the downside, **Sarepta Therapeutics** ([SRPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRPT)) sold off 3.9% just one day after rallying to less than 2% away from the 120.33 buy point, 10 cents above the 52-week high. Biotech funds fell more than 3% on Wednesday, highlighting broad-based selling pressure.


SRPT stock is building a [second-stage consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) near the rally high, even though the company is forecast to lose money in 2022 and 2023.


Finally, a reminder that it's risky to buy any stocks in this market correction. However, now is a perfect time to study IBD relative strength and accumulation leaders because this elite group could lead the next rally.

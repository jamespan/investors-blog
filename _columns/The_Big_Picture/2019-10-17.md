The stock market rally continued Thursday, but solid gains dissipated throughout the day. A new Brexit deal and stronger-than-expected [earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-gets-reprieve-ahead-of-streaming-wars/) from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) initially boosted the major indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite advanced as much as 0.7% before ending the session with mild gains.




The Nasdaq closed with a 0.4% gain, modestly off session highs. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrials closed with a gain of just 0.1%, or 23 points. A 5.5% sell-off in shares of **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The [blue chip](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) reported [weaker-than-expected](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-sales-business-transition-earnings/) sales late Wednesday.


Elsewhere, the small-cap Russell 2000 closed with a 1.1% increase, handily outperforming the major indexes. The Russell 2000 has risen six of the last seven trading sessions and is back above its 200-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 1.


Volume was mildly lower across both main exchanges, compared with Wednesday's session.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP101719-239x300.jpg)](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 0.2%, performing in line with the main indexes. The index of top growth stocks is climbing back toward the 200-day line after spending most of the past month below it.


New Stock Market Rally
----------------------


On Tuesday, the stock market powered higher, causing IBD to [upgrade its market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-surprising-gains-market-outlook-shifts/) to a confirmed uptrend. After just two losing days over the past seven trading sessions, the major stock indexes are within striking distance of record highs.


On a positive note, the Nasdaq's Oct. 2 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the overall count after the Nasdaq rose 5% intraday from that day's closing price of 7,785.25. That left the Nasdaq with a still-high six distribution days, plus seven on the S&P 500.


With a new confirmed uptrend, investors should be on the hunt for top stocks breaking out above proper buy points in heavy volume.


[Earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-when-to-buy-growth-stocks-earnings/) is once again here. Be particularly mindful of buying stocks ahead of earnings releases. (Check out [Friday's IBD Investing Action Plan](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/american-expess-stock-coca-cola-synchrony-near-buy-points/) for more earnings announcements.) On the upside, strong results can send stocks surging, often staging [bullish breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). On the downside, weaker-than-expected earnings can result in sharp breakdowns, like today's IBM sell-off.


IBD 50 Stocks: Software Falls Again
-----------------------------------



Our index of leading growth stocks — the IBD 50 — performed in line with the major stock indexes Thursday amid solid gains from IPO leader **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) and burrito maker **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)).


Chipotle stock is [approaching an 858 buy point in a flat base](https://www.investors.com/research/chipotle-stock-nears-buy-point-before-earnings-report/), as it rebounds from its 50-day line. Shares gained 0.7% Thursday.



On the downside, top software stocks continue to underperform despite the current stock market rally. Software giant **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) fell 1.3%, as it drops further below its long-term 200-day moving average. **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) moved down more than 1% ahead of its [earnings results after the close.](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/altassian-earnings-q1-2020-tsm-isrg-also-report/) (Atlassian stock [was volatile](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/atlassian-earnings-top-team-stock-q32019-falls/) after hours.) Lastly, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) fell 0.9%.


Only one software group remains within the top 40 out of 197 industries — the Computer Software-Enterprise group. Currently, the [group is ranked No. 35.](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-16-2019/) Six weeks ago, it ranked No. 10. The overall sector is facing significant deceleration amid sector rotation.

title: Small Caps Lead Stocks Higher; 6 Reasons The Bull Run May Defy The Yield Curve Inversion

Are stock bulls afraid of the yield curve inversion? Perhaps not, after all. Tuesday's stock market action showed a decent rally. And perhaps the most impressive part of the session's advance? Good breadth.




The Nasdaq composite's 0.7% gain not only stopped a two-day slide. It served to wipe out last week's total loss of 0.6%. At 7691, the tech-weighted index now stands 5.4% below the all-time peak of 8133 set on Aug. 30.


The S&P 500 matched the Nasdaq's gain. Small caps and certain sector indexes outperformed. The Russell 2000 galloped ahead 1%, and the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 0.9%. Even as crude oil briefly eclipsed the $60-per-barrel barrier again, transportation stocks sparkled. The Dow Jones transports gained 1.1%.

The Nasdaq 100 tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial issues trading on the all-electronic equities exchange.


Widening Bull Market Participation
----------------------------------


Volume fell mildly on both main exchanges. One would prefer to see the indexes rise in higher volume — a clarion call that institutions eagerly accumulated shares. Yet that's a minor gripe. When the buying is widespread like it was on Tuesday (gee, even beaten-down bank shares rebounded some), it suggests that the new bull run is building strength.


Preliminary figures showed that winners crushed losers by a 2-1 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, gainers steamrollered over losers by nearly 3-to-1. The General Market Indicators chart page, found in the link at the bottom of each Big Picture column, graphically shows the NYSE advance-decline line in the S&P 500 chart, and it is trending higher.


Look closely at a [Nasdaq daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY). Despite an elevated distribution-day count and the move on Friday to change the current market outlook to "uptrend under pressure," the pullbacks by the premier index for growth stocks have been quite mild compared with the run-ups ever since the [Jan. 4 follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) hinted at a key inflection point for stocks.


Since that follow-through signal, in fact, the biggest "correction" by the Nasdaq so far is a five-day March 4-8 drawdown that took the composite from 7643 to 7332, a 4% drop.


Measure Market Breadth This Way Too
-----------------------------------



Growth ETFs such as The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) (up 1%) and Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) (up 0.6%) also suggest that money continues to flow into the fastest-growing companies.


The IBD 50-tracking ETF is scorching the year-to-date dividend-free return of the S&P 500 so far, up 20% vs. 12.4% for the latter. Meantime, no fewer than 10 companies making [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) rallied 1% or more on Tuesday.


Two of those 10 names on Leaderboard currently reside on the sub-list, [Leaders Near A Buy Point](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). On a portfolio-weighted basis, Leaderboard stocks delivered an 11.8% gain in 2018, while the S&P 500 fell 6.2% excluding dividends.


On Leaderboard, a full position within a hypothetical portfolio dedicated to growth stocks takes up one-eighth of the entire account — or $125,000 in a $1 million portfolio. A half-size position takes up one-sixteenth, or $62,500.


Meanwhile, [MarketSmith's home page](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows more than 250 stocks up on volume vs. 98 stocks down in volume. This also suggests that mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, pension managers and the like are showing more anxiousness to pick up stocks than to dump shares.


6 Reasons To Shrug Off The Current Yield Curve Inversion
--------------------------------------------------------


On Wednesday, bond prices across the U.S. Treasury yield curve didn't move much. But the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond, now at 2.41%, fell further below three-month T-bills (2.46%).


However, one reason not to get too wrapped up in the current debate on the yield curve lies in the fact that while certain parts of the curve have inverted, other areas have not. For instance, according to the U.S. Treasury website, yields on two-year notes closed at 2.24%, still below the 2.41% yield on 10-year bonds and 2.86% on 30-year bonds. In other words, institutional investors such as banks can still make money from this positive spread between short- and long-term debt.


A second reason not to get too worried? Numerous market analysts have noted that in the past, yield curve inversions did not cause economic contractions right away. Research by both Bob Doll at money manager Nuveen and Brad MacMillan of Commonwealth Financial Network finds that a recession can occur anywhere between 12 months to 3 years after the curve goes awry.


Three, have you noticed how REITs are just killing it in 2019? They've inhabited a lot of spots within the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). High yields, stable earnings and a steady economy are helping the real estate investment trusts. They in turn help boost stock returns.


The Finance-Property REIT industry group ranks within the top 20 of IBD's [daily ranking of 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-mar-26-2019/). Through Tuesday's close, the group has risen 16.5% since Jan. 1. (Please read this recent [Inside The IBD 50 column on REIT stocks making the IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/hunting-top-growth-stocks-sector-wall-street-turning-defensive/).)


Here are three more reasons to stay focused on the price-and-volume action of stocks, not bonds:


1. The earnings yield for the S&P 500, taking a two-year forward estimate of $172.15 as calculated by economist Ed Yardeni, gives the S&P 500 an "earnings yield" of nearly 6%. That sounds a lot more appetizing for institutional investors than a 10-year Treasury bond yielding 2.41%.
2. Some observers note that with negative yields in German and Japanese bonds, strong foreign buying of U.S. Treasuries may be helping to suppress yields here.
3. The Federal Reserve recently published a study titled "The Near-Term Forward Yield Spread As A Leading Indicator: A Less Distorted Mirror." In it, authors Eric Engstrom and Steven Sharpe argue that "yields on bonds maturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns."


Keep an eagle eye on the major indexes, breakouts, growth stocks and your own portfolio.

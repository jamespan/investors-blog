Traders came back from the Thanksgiving holiday in a good mood Monday as major stock indexes kicked off the week with solid gains. In stock news today, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) outperformed, rising 5.3%.




The [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) was helped by news that Black Friday raked in $6.22 billion in online sales, up 26% from a year ago, according to data from Adobe Analytics.


Other FANG stocks outperformed including, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), up 3.5%, and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), up 2.5%.


At the close, the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.1% on the third day of its rally attempt. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rallied about 1.5% each. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Friday, but it was an easy comparison because Friday was only a half session.


Monday's big percentage gains looked good on the surface, but breadth wasn't as impressive as the index gains might suggest. NYSE advancers beat decliners by about 9-to-5. The margin was even smaller on the Nasdaq, with winners topping losers by 3-to-2.


The Nasdaq easily reclaimed the 7,000 level Monday, but the index is still technically challenged with a potential resistance level at 7,500. The S&P 500 faces potential resistance around 2,800. For the Dow Jones industrials, it's 25,000.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MP112618.jpg)The market remains in a correction. Another big percentage gain in higher volume from here by the Nasdaq might be enough to put the market back  in a confirmed uptrend. Keep in mind, though, that the Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend on Nov. 7, but the rally failed almost immediately.


Stock News Today: Financials Outperform
---------------------------------------


Financials did well in the Dow Monday, cheered by selling in the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 3.06%.


In stock news today, **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) outperformed, up 3.7%. **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) closed with gains north of 2%.


American Express drew closer to a 110.48 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point. The stock's relative strength line is in new high ground ahead of the share price making a new high, a sign of strength.


In other stock news today, **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) led the auto manufacturers group to a gain of around 6%. GM jumped above its 200-day moving average with conviction, up 4.8%, on news that the company is significantly [cutting car production in North America and halting some assembly plants](https://www.investors.com/news/gm-stock-restructuring-plan-factories-job-cuts/).


After four straight declines, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) had a good day in the Nasdaq 100, up 6%. It's still working on a cup-with-handle base. A new handle shows a 366.85 entry.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com), enterprise software name **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) was a top percentage gainer, up 5.8%. The company's next earnings report is Dec. 4 after the close. A slew of other enterprise software stocks will be out with earnings this week, as discussed in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/options-trading-salesforce-workday-splunk-earnings/) column.


**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) stock also has recovered in the enterprise software group after a failed breakout. Shares jumped 8.4% Monday.


IBD's enterprise software industry group was one of the day's top performers, up around 3%.


IBD 50 Winners
--------------


Top gainers in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) included **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), up 8.4%. After a modest pullback, Trade Desk is working on the right side of a shallow base.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) also outperformed in the IBD 50, up 5.5% to 32.82, but Twitter's 200-day moving average around 34 is a potential resistance level. **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)) was another solid gainer, up 3.6%. It's been holding nicely above its 50-day line after a modest pullback.


**Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), featured in the [Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/top-stocks-today-planet-fitness-relative-strength/) column, is also acting well. It's back above its 50-day line and only 5% off its high after briefly clearing a short pattern.


But biotech **Innoviva** ([INVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVA)) did not have a good day in the IBD 50. Shares reversed lower in heavy volume after a solid breakout last week.

Make no mistake, growth stocks prevailed Wednesday.




[The stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) displayed bullish action on a number of fronts, thanks largely to companies that have room to run. One, [breakouts by highly rated growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) looked quite decent. Two, the Nasdaq and S&P 500, bastions of high-performance, high-growth companies, rose to all-time highs.


A third reason? Divvy up companies in terms of growth vs. value metrics and valuations, and you could easily conclude that growth stocks stood on top on Hump Day.


Growth Stocks Lead Nasdaq
-------------------------


The Nasdaq composite charged 2% ahead amid a healthy increase in volume. At 17,187, it gushed to an all-time peak. The Nasdaq also hoisted its year-to-date gain to 14.5%.



Notice on a daily chart how the tech-enriched index finished virtually at its session high. That, combined with the increase in overall turnover, offers a strong hint to IBD readers that institutional investors backed up the truck to load up on growth stocks.


The suggested current outlook for active investors got upgraded to a recommended level of exposure in growth stocks to 80%-100%, up from 60%-80%.


The last time the accompanying Market Pulse table placed market exposure at 80%-100% came on May 22.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to 5354, also good for an all-time high. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange shrank modestly.


Light Moves In Blue Chips
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MP060524.jpg)In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, chock-full of blue chips that are not necessarily growing very fast, couldn't seem to get out of its own way.


A gain of less than 0.3% reflected struggles by names such as **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), a [short-sale play on IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/shortsales). All four stocks joined five other Dow components with losses of 1 point or more.


The Russell indexes also reflected a lack of buying enthusiasm for so-called cheap stocks.


While the Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) exchange traded fund, showing a solid 83 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/), bolted 1.8% ahead in accelerating turnover, Russell 1000 ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) (67 RS Rating) nudged 0.5% higher. The former has broken out of a new base at 340.83.


The median [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) for the 30 Dow industrials stocks is a decent 82. But that's not exceptional. So, in general, excepting fundamental turnaround plays, prefer those growth stocks that show an EPS score of 95 or higher.


Elsewhere, stock market internals looked good.


According to preliminary data from E-Trade Financial, a total 398 issues made 52-week or all-time highs on either the Nasdaq or NYSE vs. 200 new lows. Also, advancers beat decliners by a healthy margin on both exchanges.


On the Nasdaq, winners led losers by a 5-to-3 margin. On the NYSE? Gainers there outpaced decliners by nearly 2 to 1.

The Stimulus For Growth Stocks Today
------------------------------------


As highlighted in this [Stock Market Today story](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones-alphabet-googl-stock-crowdstrike/), a lighter than expected pickup in private sector jobs provided relief for investors. ADP announced that the economy added a net 152,000 jobs in May. That fell well below expectations and clearly was a slowdown from a downwardly revised figure of 188,000 job additions in April.


Bond markets reacted bullishly for growth stocks. How so?


For starters, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note dropped 4 basis points to 4.28%. Lower interest rates over a long time frame encourages stock investment, stock buybacks, acquisitions and the continued dishing out of value-creating cash dividends to shareholders.


Also, don't forget that some market participants still believe the Federal Reserve has both time and the motives to cut interest rates on the short end of the yield curve.


According to CME FedWatch, fed funds rate futures activity pointed to a nearly 71% possibility that the U.S. central bank will trim the fed funds rate by at least a quarter point at the Sept. 18 meeting. That's up from a 47% chance a week ago.


The fed funds rate, or what the Fed charges giant banks on overnight cash infusions, has remained at 5.25%-5.5% since July 2023.


Of course, growth stocks could take another turn in the opposite direction if Friday's nonfarm payrolls report shows an unusually hot labor market. However, given the sharp decline in the JOLTS data on Wednesday, the prospects seem less likely now.


"The slow and steady march higher for equity markets continues to confound the bears," Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at the insurance giant Nationwide, said in comments emailed to IBD. "The latest stretch is being attributed to shifting views of Fed policy, though the more accurate reason is that buying pressure from retail and institutional investors, share buybacks, and growing M&A activity provides a healthy backdrop for markets."


Among Growth Stocks, Don't Ignore This Leading Energy Firm
----------------------------------------------------------


Can energy stocks act as leading growth stocks? Absolutely. **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)), a [half-size position in the principal list of Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), has vaulted 52% since it surpassed a 188.32 early buy point within a long, deep first-stage base.



The complexion of its ratings and chart has completely changed since the utility-scale solar systems firm reaffirmed a profit turnaround. The stock has soared since it posted a 450% leap in first-quarter earnings to $2.20 a share. Revenue jumped 45% to $794 million.


In 2022, the company lost 41 cents a share for its first net loss in at least six years. But now, Wall Street sees earnings going from $7.74 a share in 2023 to $13.57, up 75% in 2024 and $20.83, up 54% in 2025.


Tight trading in upcoming weeks could generate a [follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) at its rising 10-week moving average or a [whole new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) altogether.


Utilities, meanwhile, have enjoyed an excellent second quarter. Keep in mind, however, that most do not have the same growth metrics as First Solar. Most provide a dividend that allows investors to buy and hold for good income that offsets inflation. Crude oil futures rallied 1.4% on Wednesday to $74.29 a barrel; natural gas soared 6.7% to $2.76 per million British thermal units.


The Dow Jones utility average on Wednesday fell 1% to 934.59. It still garners a 5.9% gain thus far for the second quarter. Back in 2023, the Dow utilities slid 8.8%.

title: Stocks Rise Modestly; Is There A Warning Sign In The Sideways Trend?

The major indexes rose modestly Tuesday as the market continued a pattern of dull trade and looked to earnings reports for a spark.




The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3% and the S&P 500 0.2%. The Nasdaq edged up 0.1% as weakness in internet and software industry groups offset fine gains for semiconductor and biotech groups. Despite small gains, the three indexes made new highs.


The Russell 2000 climbed 0.3%. The small cap index's seven-week rally has led the market in that period, but has stalled the past several days. Strength in financial (mainly regional banks) and technology stocks, its two largest sectors, have helped the Russell 2000 outperform.


The Dow utility average led with a burst of more than 1%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


After last week's 1% plus gains, the main indexes have basically gone sideways. Such flattening periods sometimes carry warning signs, namely heavy volume without price progress, or stalling. But there's been no such signal lately.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP101017-201x300.png)Is it a sign of exhaustion? Probably not. How can a market get tired when it's been just crawling higher?


Indexes have been unusually calm since September and for much of this year. In fact, a few major banks have bemoaned the low volatility, saying that it has resulted in lower trading revenue.


A spate of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in July and August is now far back in time, and only one distribution session has occurred in the past five weeks. The Sept. 5 distribution day was erased from the count Tuesday after it too reached its expiration date.


That reinforces the case for high exposure to stocks, and the main risk is from the indexes themselves — they've had a tendency to pull back after spending a few weeks around new highs. On the plus side, the Nasdaq has gone 11 months since its last decline of more than 5%.


Earnings season begins in earnest this week, and with it the potential for stocks to make bigger price moves. Several big banks will announce results Thursday and Friday.


The most notable part of Tuesday's breakouts was how many were megacaps: **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Toyota** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)). **Anheuser Busch InBev** ([BUD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUD)) and **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)) were other big-caps that reached buy points, although these two in unimpressive price and volume.


Wal-Mart, which announced a $20 billion stock buyback early Tuesday, surged 4.5% to lead the Dow industrials. Toyota's breakout highlighted a day when automakers led all other industry groups with a 3% increase.


Some defensive groups were in the top 10 for the day, including tobacco, dairy products, discount chains and water utilities.


While that may cause some pause, the behavior of leading stocks remains satisfactory. In the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), many stocks have ample gains from their entries. Few are tumbling. For example, **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) has slid back to around its buy point. Watch the ones forming bases — **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) for instance — for the next buying opportunities.

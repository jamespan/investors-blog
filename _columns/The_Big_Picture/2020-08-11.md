You know that old saying, "All's well that ends well"? In the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), things did not end well.




The confirmed uptrend is certainly intact, though. Given the string of recent gains, major indexes likely were due for a serious breather.


[FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) succumbed to profit-taking in the stock market today. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) slumped 3.4% and [crossed below its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Among the five megacap techs, the smallest decline belonged to Google and Youtube operator **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), down almost 1.1% on Tuesday.


But select software industry groups — specifically in gaming and medical — as well as biotech and solar companies, dropped more than 2% on a price-weighted basis. So, no wonder the Nasdaq composite led the selling with a 1.7% decline.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped 2.3%, following losses of 1.4% and 1.1% in the prior two sessions. The growth stock-centered ETF is now 5% below its 52-week peak, but also holds a healthy 5.7% gain since July 1.


After a moderate fall right after the open, the Nasdaq rumbled its way into positive territory. But a tiny gain of 0.2% during lunch time on Wall Street evaporated fast. And at around 2:15 p.m. ET, amid some reports hitting the wires over concerns about current smartphone shipments, the tech-weighted index really began rolling over.


Stock Market Today: A Profit-Taking Session
-------------------------------------------


![MP081120](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP081120-173x300.jpg)The final hour of trading turned a pleasant session into a stinky one.


The S&P 500 let a 0.6% rise melt into a 0.8% fall. That ended a seven-day sprint higher in which the large-cap benchmark had rallied 3.5%.


Volume rose on both exchanges. Hence, the Nasdaq's [count of distribution days](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) ticked up to three, still a reasonable level.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500's early advance proved big enough to erase the July 28 bout of heavy professional selling. Why? At Tuesday's intraday high of 3381, the index gained 5% above the July 28 distribution day's closing price of 3218.44.


But an 11% rise in NYSE turnover, coupled with the S&P 500's significant loss, tagged it with a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). So its count stayed at three.


Volume appeared to be below average on both exchanges.


The S&P 600, a key index for companies with a market value mostly in the $300 million to $5 billion range, saw its 1.8% early lift deflate into a loss of less than 0.1%. Still, at 919, the S&P 600 has had a tremendous third quarter so far, up almost 10.6% since the June 30 close.


A Positive Trend For Smaller Equities
-------------------------------------


Let's take a closer look at the daily chart of the S&P SmallCap 600.



Notice how it's gaining more distance above its slow-moving long-term 200-day moving average. Meanwhile, the 50-day line is rising nicely. There's similar action for the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)).


Don't Ignore Inflation
----------------------


If you thought the sell-off in U.S. equities was fairly violent, check out long-dated U.S. Treasuries.


At one point, prices dove so hard that the benchmark 10-year bond yield surged to as high as 0.66% after closing at 0.59% on Monday. For new buyers in bonds, Tuesday was a day of slaughter. July U.S. producer prices jumped 0.6%, double the 0.3% month-on-month estimate from [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Oil has continued to lift higher this quarter after a huge rebound in the spring. But even core prices showed a major jump, up 0.5% vs. the Street forecast of a 0.1% gain.


Gold and silver shares fell sharply, following the dive in precious metals futures. Wait, isn't gold supposed to rally when inflation is heading higher? Not always. Some view gold as a hedge against rampant printing of the U.S. dollar.


The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), or the VIX, snapped a seven-day slide. It jumped more than 10% to 24.42. That's still 71% below its coronavirus bear-market peak of 85.47.


Back To Stocks
--------------


Some leading growth companies showed resilience.



**Quidel** ([QDEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QDEL)), put the brakes on a steep slide, respecting the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) at least for a day. **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)), a new entry in [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/), and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) are testing their respective 10-week moving averages.

Shares remain extended after a breakout past 197.16 in a [gigantic cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/).

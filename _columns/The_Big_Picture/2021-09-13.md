Stock Market Closes Mixed, But Sellers Hit Top-Rated Growth Stocks; Energy Stocks Lead The Way
===============================================================================================

Sellers hit leading growth stocks in the stock market Monday, but the rest of the market held up relatively well, with oil and gas stocks leading the way. Solar stocks also outperformed, along with reopening stocks like airlines and hotel operators, amid signs the delta variant wave could be cresting.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index snapped five-session losing streaks, while the Nasdaq composite pared an intraday loss of nearly 0.6% to less than 0.1%.


The Dow Jones industrials jumped nearly 0.8%, helped by gains of 2% or more from **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)). The S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.6%.

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Friday.


Advancing stocks on the Nasdaq outnumbered decliners by a razor-thin margin. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by just over 2-t0-1.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 4.2% early but pared the loss to 2.7%. It's currently testing support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Several IBD 50 components were hit hard, with **Dynavax** ([DVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVAX)), **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) and **Affirm** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)) suffering double-digit percentage declines. DVAX stock flashed a sell signal with the largest one-day point drop since the Aug. 11 breakout.


IBD 50 stock **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) also flashed a sell signal for the same reason, but the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock is still holding above its 50-day moving average. The position was trimmed in late August when the stock was trading above an upper channel line. InMode first joined Leaderboard in early June at 89.80.


Energy stocks moved higher as oil topped the $70 level for the first time in nearly six weeks. U.S. crude oil futures for October delivery settled at $70.45 a barrel, up 1.1%.



Some of the more compelling growth stories in the sector come from oil and gas producers like **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)). The stock closed off highs Monday, but shares still rallied 3% as they form a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) with a 30.65 buy point. Also in the group, **Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) has a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) near highs as the stock trades near a 16.48 entry.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was the top performing S&P sector ETF Monday, up 2.9%. **APA Corp**. ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) was the best percentage gainer in the S&P 500 Monday, up 7.8%, followed by **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)), up 7.2% and **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)), up 6.7%.


Select financial stocks also outperformed in the stock market, but not because of rising interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 2 basis points to 1.32%.

CLOSE




**Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) was a top gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), up 3.7%. The Arizona-based bank is only 10% off its high in a 20-week consolidation. **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) rallied just over 1% and is near the top of a 14-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


Time To Play Defense
--------------------


The Nasdaq composite picked up a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Friday, but the index avoided one Monday with a small percentage decline. The Nasdaq's Aug. 6 distribution day fell off the count Monday because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant.


The stock market fired a couple of warnings shots late last week when sellers came into the Nasdaq and S&P 500 during the final hour of trading on Thursday and Friday. Strong opens and weak closes are often a sign of deteriorating stock market health, just like weak opens and strong closes are hallmarks of a healthy market.


A weak finish to the week, and more volatility Monday, is a reminder to growth investors that it's important to assess current holdings at this point.


With the stock market still on a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), it makes sense to give your winners room to work. But it makes even more sense to trim top performers that are starting to show signs of weakness. Consider trimming stocks that have violated short-term support levels like the 10-day moving average or the 21-day line. Consider taking full profits in stocks that have lost support at the 50-day line.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts next week, and the Fed will have plenty of economic data to ponder this week. The latest reading on consumer prices will be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Empire State Manufacturing index and industrial production data will be out Wednesday. On Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing index will be out, along with August retail sales data.

Market pundits who declared "sell in May and go away" appear to be zipping their mouths shut lately.




The S&P 500, a laggard among the major indexes so far in 2018, took charge. The large-cap proxy rallied 1.3% on Wednesday, setting up what may be a nifty performance for May.


The Nasdaq composite trailed by a tad. The tech-driven index gained almost 0.9%. Yet it posted the highest close since March 16. And on a year-to-date basis, the Nasdaq still stands as the top performer. At 7462, its 8% advance since Jan. 1 simply towers over the measly 1.9% gain by the S&P 500.


Better Than The S&P 500, Way Better
-----------------------------------


With one trading session left in May, the Nasdaq has rallied 5.6% for the month, the S&P 500 up 2.9%, and the Dow Jones industrials up 2.1%.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has risen 5.8% on a price-weighted basis over the same time frame. [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) has vaulted 6.2%. [IBD Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) is up 7.2%.


Volume fell on both main exchanges, but not by much. Nasdaq turnover eased less than 2%. On the NYSE, activity cooled off by 4% vs. the prior session. After the S&P 500 logged a distribution day on Tuesday, you'd much prefer to see portfolio managers back up the truck and buy with abandon.


While that didn't happen, the market still showed plenty of bullish elements.


Bullish Element No. 1: The Advance-Decline Line
-----------------------------------------------


First, breadth in the advance seems to just get better.


On the NYSE, winning issues trampled over losing ones by a more than 4-1 ratio. As you can see in the S&P 500 large daily chart in the General Market Indicators page (find the link at the end of this article), the NYSE's advance-decline line hit new high ground. It clearly shows that an expanding number of stocks are rising vs. falling in price.


Among IBD's industry rankings, dozens of groups beat the S&P 500 by rallying 2% or more. And a dozen groups, from RV makers to jewelry retailers, from automakers to steel producers, and from integrated oil producers to automation machinery firms, jumped 3% or higher.


The top groups included numerous oil-related names as U.S. crude oil futures rebounded 2.2% and back above $68 a barrel. And a few of the top industry groups do in fact hail from so-called defensive industries. Think dairy products (up 3.4%) and supermarkets and mini-markets (up 2.6%). No wonder, then, that on the NYSE, winners smashed losers by a more than 4-1 margin.


On the Nasdaq, gainers beat losers by a 2-1 margin. Also good for equity investors and breakout hunters.


Which Stocks Went Down?
-----------------------


On the downside, just three of IBD's [197 industry groups and subgroups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) sank 1% or more. They included the residential and commercial builders, down 1%. Some interest-rate-sensitive names surely are struggling in 2018.


The Dow utility average, which tends to hold companies with massive debt on their balance sheets, gained 0.7% on Wednesday. But at 694, it's still fallen more than 4% since Jan. 1.


Second, it's quite remarkable to see how the major averages are absorbing numerous risks that create the proverbial wall of worry. These risks span from runaway crude oil prices to another flare-up in rhetoric between President Trump and Chinese technocrats on the issue of fair trade and tariffs.


Mighty Mites
------------


On Wednesday, the small-cap S&P 600 led the upside, rising more than 1.5%. The Russell 2000-tracking iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rolled 1.6% to new highs.


Generally speaking, smaller companies show less exposure to international trade and could be seen as the anti-trade-war play of 2018. U.S. GDP growth got a slight downgrade to 2.2% on Wednesday, but some observers expect an acceleration in economic expansion in the second quarter.


Italy has moved to front-burner status among worries for global macro fund managers. Stocks apparently rallied Wednesday on easing concerns that a potential new national election in the No. 3 economy in the eurozone could increase the risk of "Italexit," "Itexit," or "Italeave."


The risk of an ultra-hawkish Federal Reserve, which meets on interest rates in two weeks, cannot be ignored. But for now, that risk seems to have abated. Why? The odds of a fourth rate hike by December has dropped to just 25%, according to the CME Group's fed funds futures tracker.


Keep An Eye On The Rates
------------------------


Yields on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond have come down a lot. The benchmark yield has plunged from a seven-year high of 3.11% to as low as 2.77% on Tuesday. On Wednesday, institutions sold Treasuries, sending the yield back up to 2.88%.


Third, leading stocks continue to excel.


The Sector Leaders screen still has as many as 16 names lately. Companies such as **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) and **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) are making money for astute IBD readers who buy only those stocks that show excellence in fundamentals and big breakouts in heavy volume.


Fourth, the overall level of heavy institutional selling remains largely in check.


On Wednesday, the April 24 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the S&P 500 expired on time. As the Market Pulse shows, that leaves the S&P 500 with six distribution days. That's an elevated level. But keep in mind that one of those distribution days is the May 15 stalling session.


The average decline among the other five distribution days is 0.8%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's distribution count is still mild at three.


Bull markets don't die from a rush of stalling sessions.

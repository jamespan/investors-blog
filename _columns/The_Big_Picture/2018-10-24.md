  Key Indexes Undercut Lows; Why Growth Stocks Are Nearly In A Bear Market

The Nasdaq composite paced an intense sell-off on Wednesday, capping the highly bearish session with a waterfall-style decline in the final 90 minutes of trade.




The Nasdaq composite fell 4.4%, marking its worst single-day decline in more than seven years. The S&P 500 dropped 3.1%, and the Dow Jones industrials fell 2.4%. Volume, which had been running lower for most of the day, increased by session's end on both main exchanges. Investors found a safe haven in utility, food, soap and REIT stocks, all of which tend to dish out a healthy scoop of dividends.


Wednesday's bloodletting also reaffirmed how, in a serious market correction, the best short-term asset for investors' portfolio is still cash.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP_102418-216x300.jpg)IBD's official outlook for the current market, as noted by [The Big Picture column published on Oct. 10](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bears-stocks-correction/), got downgraded to "market in correction" from "uptrend under pressure"on the same day that the Nasdaq composite slid 4.1% and pierced through the long-term 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a year.


Two days after that severe drop, stocks rebounded. But the rally lasted barely three days. On Oct. 18, the Nasdaq fell back below the 200-day moving average.


A Bad Technical Sign
--------------------


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's 50-day moving average, which suddenly flattened out in early October, has clearly crested and has begun to slope lower. Market internals look very sick as well. On Wednesday, declining stocks trumped gainers by a more than a 5-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and a 7-2 margin on the NYSE. The [new lows list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-23-2018/) is crushing new highs.


Fear over the outlook on earnings next year, ongoing vigilance over trade tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding the Republican party's ability to hold majorities in Congress following midterm elections on Nov. 6 are just some of the reasons why U.S. stocks are now joining many other equity markets around the world in the losers column. The Nasdaq, closing the day at 7108, still has a 3% year-to-date gain. But the S&P 500 is now down nearly 1%.


The S&P SmallCap 600, off 3.5% on Wednesday, is now down 1.6% since Jan. 1.


Signs Of A Bear Market
----------------------


At 7106, the Nasdaq has erased more than five months' worth of gains. It stands 12.6% below the all-time high of 8133, set on Aug. 30. In other words, fear almost always sends stock prices down a lot quicker than how greed drives prices up.


An intermediate correction typically means that a key index drops anywhere from 10% to 19.9% from its 52-week or all-time highs.


However, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which dropped 4.7% on Wednesday, is only a small decline away from posting a bear-market correction of 20% or more. At 31.07, the ETF has fallen 19.9% from its 2018 peak and is now down 6.4% year to date.


Such drops are actually good for the long-term health of bull runs. They help keep optimism from boiling. Just look at the latest figure of the [Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter editors](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/): Bullishness has now dropped from a dangerous level of 61.8% to 50.5% in the span of three weeks.


Investor Fear Continues To Rise
-------------------------------


Meanwhile, recent sharp rises in the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) hint that fear is also rising among options traders. Big spikes in the put-call ratio have frequently signaled that a short-term market bottom is near. This means that now is the best time to form a new watch list of stocks. When a new rally attempt is confirmed, at least a few emerging winners will actually break out and hit new highs.


Looking at the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20, few top-rated firms are ready to break out anytime soon. Why? Most of these names have been hammered far beneath their 50-day moving averages. Names such as **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) (which edged higher after it reported quarterly results after the close), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) (up after hours following its fiscal Q1 results) are already battling or are on the verge of testing support at the 200-day moving averages.


For now, as you form your watch list, look for positive reversals on a weekly chart; tight closes on a weekly basis; a stock's refusal to hit new lows even as the major indexes do so; a positive change in the Accumulation/Distribution Rating; and evidence of newfound industry-group strength. [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) and [Stocks On The Move screen](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) can help.


Another Form Of Sector Rotation
-------------------------------


Clearly, money has flowed to Steady Eddy blue chips that have largely sat out the big run since the last time the Nasdaq and S&P 500 made a 20%-plus decline in 2011. IBD's [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) currently highlights a few megacaps that are highly unlikely to go out of business, show modest increases in earnings and sales, and deliver a reliable quarterly dividend.

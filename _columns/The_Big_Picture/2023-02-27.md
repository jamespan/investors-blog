The stock market tried to get its uptrend back on track Monday, but it wasn't much of a rebound. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major indexes faded into the close after being up more than 1%.




With no big earnings, economic reports or geopolitical headlines, bond and commodity markets held steady but investors had little to work with.


The S&P 500 rose 0.3% but left behind a 1.2% early gain. The Nasdaq composite trimmed a 1.5% gain to 0.6%, making it the de facto market leader Monday. The Dow rose 0.2%.


Volume edged lower on the NYSE and was slightly higher on the Nasdaq.


Friday's market action gave hope of a rebound. That's when the S&P 500 found support at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) and closed near session highs.


The Nasdaq composite closed near the 200-day moving average Friday and climbed back above it Monday.

Stock Market Internals To Watch
-------------------------------


Monday's bounce was little relief for indexes that have been  in downward price trends for nearly a month. Until the indexes show a definite change in direction, investors need to remain cautious.


Some market internals are unfavorable.


For about two weeks, the 10-day moving average of stocks down in volume exceeds the same moving average for stocks up in volume. The opposite trend had been in place since the start of the year.


One day of support doesn't guarantee anything in this market. On Thursday, for example, the S&P 500 appeared to be finding support at the 50-day moving average with a bullish close. The next day, the index fell to its next support level, the 200-day line.


Strength In IBD 50 And Tanker Stocks
------------------------------------


A couple of pockets of strength did appear.


The IBD 50 outperformed the stock market with a 1.3% gain, thanks to some strong individual performers.


**Mobileye Global** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) and seven other IBD 50 stocks rose more than 2%.



And [oil tanker stocks came up big](https://www.investors.com/research/oil-tankers-continue-to-rally-earnings-take-them-to-the-top/), figuring among Monday's best-performing stocks.


Just one day before its earnings report, **International Seaways** ([INSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSW)) broke out of a cup base with a 48.22 buy point. Its relative strength line also made a new high, and volume was strong.


**Tsakos Energy Navigation** ([TNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNP)) led the charge with a nearly 9% rally in heavy volume. It's risen more than 25% from a Feb. 7 breakout past 19.10. **Teekay Tankers** ([TNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNK)) has reached the 20% profit target from its 36.71 buy point.


Stock Market Short On Headlines
-------------------------------


Monday's stock market headlines were unremarkable, with no major economic or earnings news.


January durable goods orders fell 4.5%, a bit worse than [economist forecasts for a 4% drop](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Orders ex-transportation rose 0.7% and core capital goods climbed 0.8% — both above views. Pending home sales climbed 8.1% in January, well above forecasts for a 1% increase. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) rose 0.5%.


**Seagen** ([SGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGEN)) soared more than 10% after [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-in-early-stage-talks-to-acquire-seagen-3f53309e?mod=hp_lead_pos1) that **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) is in early talks to acquire the cancer specialist. The deal could be worth more than $30 billion. Pfizer stock fell 2.3% to the lowest low since July 2021.


SGEN shares gapped above a cup-with-handle base with a 165.03 buy point. But now, buyout talks will drive the stock's direction. Last year, reports said **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) was [in talks to buy Seagen](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sgen-stock-rockets-as-yet-another-big-pharma-reportedly-considers-a-takeover/) for more than $200 per share, causing a period of volatile trading. But the deal never materialized.


In a mixed retail sector, bellwether **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) will report January-quarter results Tuesday before the open. The stock hasn't recovered from last May's earnings report, when the February-April 2022 quarter incurred a 41% drop in EPS, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Since then, shares have been rangebound from 140 to 180.


Analysts expect Target to post Q4 earnings of $1.40 per share, a big decline from $3.19 a year ago. FactSet shows a consensus sales estimate of $30.674 billion, which would be the first decline in at least seven quarters.

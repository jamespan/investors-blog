Stocks bounced Monday, taking back some of last week's heavy losses in a rocky session.

  

Helped by software, data storage and online travel stocks, the Nasdaq climbed 0.7% and closed back above its 50-day moving average, which it breached Friday.

  

The S&P 500 also climbed 0.7%, but failed to retake its 50-day line. Still, the benchmark index continued a pattern seen this year: Its losing streaks last no more than three days.

  

Both of the major averages recouped what they lost Friday and then some. Also, the Nasdaq has regained about a third of last week's 2.2% drop, while the S&P 500 retraced a little more than a quarter of last week's 2.7% hit.

  

The Russell 2000 rallied 0.9%. Small caps had been lagging the S&P 500 badly in the past month, but the Russell appeared to have found support near the 1100 level last week.

  

As noted in [Monday's column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/080114-711553-stocks-trim-losses-but-still-close-lower.htm), the market this year has tended to bounce when the put-call volume ratio gets above 1.0, which it did Thursday and Friday. The put-call ratio retreated to 0.83 Monday from 1.19 Friday.

  

While price action was strong Monday, volume was a letdown. Trade fell sharply across the board from Friday's pace and ended below average on both major exchanges.

  

Turnover on the Nasdaq was the slowest since July 21. The day's soft volume suggests that institutional investors weren't rushing back into the market.

  

August tends to be characterized by dull trade. But Monday's decline in volume was significant.

  

Winners beat losers by a little less than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.

  

The market still has a high amount of distribution, and the uptrend remains under pressure. Buying stocks is OK, but more risky at this point.

  

Leading stocks gave strong showings Monday, with the IBD 50 surging 1.9%. A number of Chinese stocks were up big on robust turnover.

  

**TAL Education Group** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) and **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) jumped 6% and 5%, respectively. Both scored new highs in solid volume.

  

**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) also put in strong rallies. YY closed back above a 78.83 buy point from a deep cup-with-handle base.

  

Outside of Chinese stocks, **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) rose past a 1292.76 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern. There was no specific company news, but volume was nearly double its average. Its earnings are due Monday.

  

Elsewhere, oil producers bounced back after getting hit hard last week. **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) both rose for the first time in four sessions. Both companies are set to report earnings Wednesday.

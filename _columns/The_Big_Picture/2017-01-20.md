U.S. stock indexes crept higher Friday, as President Trump took the oath of office.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each rose 0.3%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.5%. The small-cap S&P 600 and Russell 2000 rolled almost 0.5% higher.

The Nasdaq suffered stalling, which is a form of distribution.


Bank stocks and chips, two sectors that have done well since Trump's election, rose Friday. The Philadelphia semiconductor index popped 1.3%, while PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)), an exchange traded fund, rose 0.6%.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Earnings season kicks into full swing this coming week. You can't watch them all, so focus on the leading stocks. [Twenty three IBD 50 stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/a-peek-at-sales-estimates-for-ibd-50-firms-in-2017-how-rosy/) are expected to report sales growth of at least 20%, with 16 set to deliver topline gains of 30% or more.*

Since the Nov. 8 close, bank stocks have received plenty of attention for their strong price performance. Q4 earnings results for banks also have been strong.


However, a look at IBD's 197 industry groups for postelection leaders may hold some surprises. Here are the percentage gains for the industry groups that have led the market since the Nov. 8 close. Data is through Friday but preliminary.


34% gain: oil and gas drillers.


31% gain: magazines and distributors.


29% gain: oil and gas field services; and retail and wholesale auto.


28% gain: mining metal ores.


27% gain: steel producers.


26% gain: transportation equipment; and Southwest banks.


25% gain: metal products distributors; heavy construction.


24% gain: superregional banks; staffing; for-profit schools; steel alloys.


23% gain: automakers; life insurance; oil and gas machinery; office supplies.


22% gain: Midwest banks; and Southeast banks.


21% gain: Northeast banks.


20% gain: RVs, consumer loans, investment banks; oil and gas royalties; and airlines.


On the negative side, the Trump rally had two major losers. Department stores dropped 12% and food and dairy fell 11%.


IBD-style investors neither see laggards as bargains nor dismiss winners as automatically too late to buy.


Rather, the IBD investor should look at the leaders within the top groups to see if a valid entry is possible.


For the week, the small-cap S&P 600 lost 1.5%; the Dow, 0.3%; the Nasdaq, 0.3%; and the S&P 500, 0.1%. The gold exchange traded fund iShares Gold Trust ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) rose for a fourth straight week; the ETF has gained about 7% in that period.

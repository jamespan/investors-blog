The stock market extended its losses for a second day in a row as inflation and jobs data delivered a one-two punch to interest-rate expectations and, consequently, growth stocks.




That knocked the Nasdaq composite down 1.7%, marking its biggest percentage decline since Oct. 4, when it shed 2.1%. Since the tech-heavy index had been hitting resistance around 16,000, the fact it got turned away again wasn't surprising.


After an 11-day win streak for the Nasdaq, a pause was in order. Since last week, the Big Picture has been cautioning that a pullback may be in store.


"While the stock market is humming, investors cannot afford to become complacent," [the Nov. 2 column warned](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-extends-gains-but-are-indexes-getting-stretched-leaders-act-bullish/). "The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are roughly 4% above their 50-day moving averages, a sign they may be getting stretched."


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP111021_2-251x300.jpg)The S&P 500, which halted an eight-session advance on Tuesday, finished Wednesday with a 0.8% loss. Small caps tracked by the Russell 2000 sank nearly 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.7%. **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stock fell 5% after hours, following an earnings miss.


Energy, technology and communication services saw the biggest losses among S&P's 11 sectors. Only three sectors scored modest gains: utilities, consumer staples and health.


Inflation Rate Hits 31-Year High
--------------------------------


Early Wednesday, the Labor Department said the [consumer price index soared 6.2% year over year in October](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-blows-up-to-30-year-high-dow-jones/), the biggest annual increase since November 1990. That beat Econoday forecasts for a 5.8% rise. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 4.6% for a new 30-year high.


Meantime, weekly jobless claims fell to 267,000, a new pandemic-era low. That met Econoday estimates and was slightly lower than last week's 269,000 reading. The jobs data was further evidence that the U.S. economy is not so much in need of stimulus.


The 10-year Treasury yield spiked 9 basis points to 1.56% as stocks fell. The benchmark yield staged a near-term peak at 1.69% on Oct. 22. Some investors worry the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates earlier than expected due to higher inflation.


The [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) index had a bad day as several stocks suffered huge losses. That hurt the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), whose 4.4% drop was the biggest since Sept. 28, when it sank 5.4%.


Growth Stocks Get Pummeled
--------------------------


**Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) plunged 21% in heavy trade after its Q3 results. The stock erased all of Tuesday's 16% gain, and then some. The sharp drop sent shares tumbling below a 408.08 buy point of cup with handle, triggering the [round-trip sell](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/key-sell-signal-saved-stamps-com-stock-investors-from-posting-big-losses/) rule and the [7%-8% loss sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).



**Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) sank 18%, gapping down below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume — another sell signal. Late Tuesday, the consumer lender reported better-than-expected Q3 results. But [Upstart's revenue guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/upst-stock-tumbles-as-guidance-disappoints/) may have disappointed some investors.


**Affirm Holdings** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)) plunged 15% in huge turnover to test its 50-day line ahead of quarterly results. But shares rallied after hours, as the payment services firm's December-quarter revenue guidance [topped Street forecasts](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/afrm-stock-affirm-stock-affirm-earnings-sept2021/).


Only three IBD 50 stocks — **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)) **—** escaped the rout.


Unity Software reversed from a nearly 10% dive and closed 3% higher to lead the upside on the IBD 50. Shares tumbled early Wednesday, even though the animation software maker [crushed Q3 sales targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/unity-stock-unity-software-beats-targets-buys-weta-digital/) and reported a smaller-than-expected loss.


In IPO news, **Rivian Automotive** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) made its widely anticipated debut, rallying 29% on its first day. The [electric vehicle startup](https://www.investors.com/news/rivian-ipo-rivn-on-tap-as-ev-startup-seeks-to-cash-in-with-tesla-lucid-soaring/) priced 153 million shares at $78 a share Tuesday night, raising $11.9 billion. That gave Rivian an initial valuation of about $70 billion. RIVN stock opened at 106.75, far above its offer price.


What Should Investors Do Now?
-----------------------------


Though the S&P 500 added a second distribution day Wednesday, the market is still in a [confirmed uptrend](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/action-plans/). So it's OK to buy off solid breakouts.


But given the increased volatility the past two days, as well as inflation concerns, investors need to be diligent about taking profits and cutting losses.


Don't hesitate to lock in gains when stocks reach the [20%-25% profit-taking goal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/). Review defensive sell rules so you can act quickly.

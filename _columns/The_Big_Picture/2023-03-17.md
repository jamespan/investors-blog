The stock market ended the week on the ropes amid a painful bear attack on quadruple-witching day. Next week will be key in finding out whether indexes can fight back â€” or get clobbered to the canvas.




The Nasdaq composite fared best of the major indexes but still fell 0.7%. Even so, the tech-heavy index turned in an eye-catching 4.4% weekly gain, bolstered by Big Tech strength.


The index now sits above major moving averages, with the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) lifting above the 200-day. This is a bullish technical maneuver known as the "golden cross." The Nasdaq is up about 12% so far this year.


The S&P 500 fell 1.1% but still rose just over 1% for the week. It has managed to book gains in two of the past four weeks and is positive for the year, rising more than 2%. Nevertheless, the blue-chip index closed the week below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), a sign of weakness.


Decliners outnumbered gainers by around 5-to-1 on the NYSE and 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Quarterly triple witching juiced volume on the day when index futures, index options and stock options expired.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed, falling 1.2%. It has now retreated almost 4% for the year. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fared best, with a 1.2% gain.


Small caps were punished in Friday's stock market amid ongoing weakness among regional banks, with the Russell 2000 falling 2.6%. Growth stocks were also hit. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 1.3%.


With the market in correction, now is a good time to build a robust watchlist of actionable stocks in leading groups.


Crunch Week Looms: What Will Powell Do?
---------------------------------------


Just over a week ago, many wondered if Fed Chair Jerome Powell and central bank governors would opt for a 0.5% rate hike due to hot inflation data.


But the calculous has changed after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-exposed Signature Bank. **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)), which lost more than 30% Friday, is also struggling despite an influx of capital.


Next week's Fed meeting now carries even more risk, even though the futures market expects just a quarter-point tightening.


The chairman's appearance before Congress earlier this month spooked markets, sending indexes reeling. Powell will have to walk a tightrope in his post-meeting press conference to instill confidence, balancing the fight vs. inflation against a potential bank system meltdown.


Bond yields are tumbling amid a flight to safety, and crude oil is also falling. The Fed arguably has an excuse to tap the brakes to contemplate the changing economic environment.

These Stock Market Groups Shine Bright
--------------------------------------


Most S&P 500 sectors ended in negative territory. Technology and communication services fared best while financials suffered the most.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups offered further insights for stock market investors.


Gold miners and makers of database and desktop software shined. The airfreight transportation group also stood out, following a strong quarterly report from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)).


Solar stocks, oil & gas machinery plays and diversified insurers all lagged. Superregional, Southwest and Midwest bank stocks also struggled.

The stock market posted a disappointing performance Thursday, as Fed chief Jerome Powell indicated a half-point rate hike at May's Fed policy meeting. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off sharply after reversing lower from big gains at the open.




 


Powell said Thursday that bringing inflation down is "absolutely essential" and that a half-percentage point hike "will be on the table for the May meeting." [The central bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-could-seal-expectations-of-half-point-rate-rise-in-may-11650533444?mod=hp_lead_pos1) is also set to begin shrinking its $9 trillion asset portfolio. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped to 2.91%, its highest level since December 2018.


Indexes started fading well before Powell's remarks.


Stocks opened higher, partly on a surge in **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock following strong quarterly results. But the stock faded along with the market.


Tesla surged nearly 12% before slashing gains to about 3%. Late Wednesday, the electric-vehicle giant [beat Wall Street's estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-tesla-earnings-shanghai-plant/). The company's EPS jumped 246% to $3.22 with sales up 81% to $18.76 billion. Tesla shares are still approaching a cup-with-handle buy point at 1,152.97.


Meanwhile, Tesla Chief Executive [Elon Musk continued his pursuit](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-musk-gets-finance-commitments/) of **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)). In a new securities filing, Musk said he received commitments for $46.5 billion to help finance the deal, and suggested he might make a tender offer for Twitter shares, which rose 0.7% Thursday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP042122--239x300.jpg)On the earnings front, **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)), **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) were key earnings movers Thursday.


[Alcoa crumbled](https://www.investors.com/news/alcoa-stock-falls-on-outlook-steel-dynamics-crushes-views/) nearly 17% to break down below its 50-day line in heavy volume after the company warned of higher costs. CSX pared gains to 2.8%, as it forms a flat base with a 38.73 buy point. Nucor jumped nearly 3.8% and is about 40% above a double bottom's 126.77 buy point. Steel Dynamics rose 1.9% and is about 35% above a 68.27 double-bottom entry.


Struggling Stock Market Uptrend
-------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1% Thursday, while the S&P 500 ended 1.5% lower, back below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The S&P met resistance around its 200-day moving average and is back near its April lows. A sharp break through these lows could signals more downside and further weaken an already-struggling stock market uptrend.


At the market open, the Nasdaq composite jumped as much as 1.9% before reversing lower and selling off 2.1%. Bearishly, the tech-heavy index met resistance at its 50-day line and made a new low for its current down leg. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 2.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session, resulting in a new distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The updated [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) stands at six on both major stock indexes. The market outlook remains an "uptrend under pressure," and investors should be exercising great care.


Top growth stocks also moved down sharply, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tumbled 3.5% to hit its lowest level since Feb. 24. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **LSB Industries** ([LXU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LXU)) dived more than 13%, and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) skidded 6.4% as agricultural stocks also sold off.

Edwards Lifesciences Is A Stock Market Leader
---------------------------------------------



Despite a struggling stock market uptrend, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) is one of the top stocks to watch after Wednesday's breakout move. Shares are in the [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) past a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) 125.21 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The buy area goes up to 131.47. But after a 2.1% drop Thursday, Edwards is threatening to fall below its buy point.


On the breakout day, volume increased only 28% above average. Volume should increase at least 40% above average to signify strong institutional demand. On the plus side, the stock's relative strength line hit a new high ahead of the breakout. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [EW stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-edwards-lifesciences-ew.aspx) shows a solid 91 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


Keep in mind that the current market conditions are suspect. Even the best stocks will falter during general market weakness. Be sure to cut any losses at 7%-8% below the buy point to avoid further losses.

-------------------------


Late Thursday, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) reported their quarterly earnings. [ISRG shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/isrg-stock-intuitive-surgical-beats-first-quarter-goals/) rallied more than 2% in extended trade, while [Snap advanced](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-jumps-despite-earnings-miss/) 5% late.

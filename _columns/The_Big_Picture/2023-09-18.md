  Small Stock Market Gains Fade As Investors Look Ahead To Fed; Why Stocks Could Get Worse In Next 2 Weeks

Indexes faded Monday in a dubious start to a week that could see a lot more stock market volatility in a few days.




Monday's early gains were never big. The Nasdaq climbed as much as 0.3% and the S&P 500 nearly 0.4% before closing practically flat. Indexes also closed off their session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended almost unchanged.


The three main indexes remained below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). Whenever morning gains evaporate into the close, it's a sign of a flagging stock market. But Monday's small price ranges made it harder to gain clarity on market trends. For now, defensive trading needs to take priority.


Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 fell 0.7%. The index closed two of the last three sessions below the 200-day moving average. Some chart readers spot a bearish [head-and-shoulders pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/head-and-shoulders-pattern-spots-short-sale-entries-but-beware-of-patterns-headaches/) forming in the Russell 2000, and more declines would break the formation's neckline. That would set off more alarm bells.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP091823-261x300.jpg)Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq — as widely expected after [Friday's witching session](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-loses-key-level-ahead-of-fed-meeting-jerome-powell-this-hot-group-struggles/) caused volume to soar. The Nasdaq had its busiest day of trading of 2023 and the NYSE its second busiest.


The stock market had been trading pretty steady until it lost its composure Friday, when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slid more than 1%. Also Friday, indexes went right back below their 50-day lines. That was a principal reason why IBD's current market outlook is "uptrend under pressure" and the recommended exposure is a moderate 20%-40%.


Stock Market History Not On Bulls' Side
---------------------------------------


Investors should be raising their shields right now. Any stock purchases should be reserved for exceptional cases. Taking profits is smart, and this is certainly not the time to ignore sell signals. Cut any loss at 7%.


Historical trends are on the side of market bears. September, traditionally the worst month for the stock market, tends to be weaker in the second half of the month. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the Nasdaq climbs an average of 0.3% in the first half of September but falls 1.2% in the second half. The S&P falls 0.2% in the first half and 0.9% in the second half.


The Fed's policy statement lands right in the middle of the stock market's week, literally and figuratively.


In what could be the most volatile day, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon is not expected to change interest rates. But the policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell's comments will set the scene for the Fed's moves going forward.


"The Fed will also be aware that rising energy prices could imperil success at reaching 2% inflation as quickly as they would like while adding to the mounting pressure on consumers from higher interest rates, resumption of student loan repayments, and the depletion of excess accumulated savings, not to mention rising real interest rates as inflation decelerates and quantitative tightening continues," Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, said in a note.


IPOs, FedEx Earnings
--------------------


**FedEx**'s ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) earnings release is not an economic report, but in some ways it offers clues about the overall economy. The shipping and delivery giant acts as an economic barometer because the company is a cog in much of U.S. business activity. FedEx will announce August-quarter results [Wednesday after the close](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-fedex-stock-relative-strength-quarterly-results/). It will be one of the most widely watched earnings reports this week.


After **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) became the biggest IPO of the year last week, five more companies are going public this week, according to Renaissance Capital. The best-known name is Instacart, which is expected to raise $638 million at an IPO price of $28-$30 per share.


Arm gave the IPO market a boost, although shares have given back much of their first-day gains.


Today's stock market is less reliant on the so-called Magnificent Seven. Last month, the seven megacaps accounted for just 16% of the S&P 500's decline. In July, the same seven stocks were responsible for 32% of the S&P's gains, and 73% for Q2 gains, according to DataTrek Research.


Yet they still make up big pieces of the major indexes.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rebounded 1.7% Monday, after Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said [preorders for the iPhone 15 models](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-rises-on-reports-of-strong-iphone-15-pro-demand/) are up about 10% to 12% from last year's iPhone 14 launch. The other Magnificent Seven were narrowly mixed, except for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). The EV company tumbled 3.3%.


The IBD 50 index fell 0.1% Monday. Tesla was its worst performer. Several IBD 50 stocks are making minor penetrations of their 50-day lines, including **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)), **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) and **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)).


**Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) led the IBD 50 with a 3.4% jump that gave it a solid move above a 162.20 buy point.

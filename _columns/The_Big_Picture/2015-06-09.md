S&P 500 Inches Higher As Indexes Pare Losses
=============================================

The main stock indexes made positive price reversals Tuesday, the latest in the market's run of mixed signals. The Nasdaq, down as much as 0.9% early on, closed only 0.2% lower. Weakness in biotech, solar and some technology stocks hurt the composite.

  

The Nasdaq did close back above its 50-day moving average, which made its reversal all the more interesting.

  

The S&P 500 climbed a fraction. The energy sector rallied as crude prices topped $60 a barrel, and that contributed to the index's performance.

  

Small caps lagged; the Russell 2000 lost 0.3%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

Breadth was worse than the indexes would suggest. Losers topped winners by 9 to 5 on the NYSE and by 3 to 2 on the Nasdaq. A day like that doesn't help the NYSE advance-decline line (plotted on the S&P 500 chart on Page B4), which is curving downward.

  

While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are trying to end modest downtrends, the view from higher altitude still shows the S&P in a horizontal range and the Nasdaq barely tilting higher.

  

After last week's high, the Nasdaq ended a trend of higher highs it had formed since its January lows. This week, it erased all gains — modest as they were — from the May 14 follow-through. That's why a rebound at this point looms as an important test for the market.

  

If indexes have been trendless, so have most leading stocks.

  

The [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/) and its relative strength line are both near new highs. Yet, most of the member stocks remain unable to climb much from their most recent buy points. That's making for quite an unsatisfying spring for growth investors.

  

On Tuesday, the IBD 50 fell less than 0.1%. **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), one of the medical leaders in the list, made a decisive move past a 210.55 buy point in heavy trading.

  

Some of the best gains are coming from leading stocks with big question marks. For example,**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) has been surging after breaking out of a higher-risk late-stage base. **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) also rallied from a late-stage base.

  

Chip stocks, a top sector, have weakened, but there was some relief for them Tuesday. A handful seemed to find support at the 50-day moving average or near their most recent breakout points. **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Microsemi** ([MSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCC)), **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) were some of those.

  

Continued rebounds would be crucial for this important batch of stocks.

  

Meanwhile, banking stocks have been trending higher with rising interest rates.

  

In the IBD 50, **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) and **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) are at new highs. **The SPDR S&P Regional Bank** ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) exchange-traded fund has jumped about 5% in two weeks. Large banks such as **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) also are near highs.

  

But airlines continued their rapid descent.

  

Lowered forecasts from U.S. carriers**Southwest** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) added to capacity concerns. Many of the group's stocks are breaking down.

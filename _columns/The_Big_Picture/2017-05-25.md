 U.S. stock indexes climbed to new highs Thursday as the pressure came off the market's uptrend.


The Nasdaq ran 0.7% higher, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average jogged 0.4% and 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 shuffled to a 0.2% gain.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have notched six up days in a row, advancing 3% and 2% during that period.


One concern for individual investors is volume. As the Nasdaq advanced in recent sessions, volume has generally stepped down. Bulls would like to see the gains coming in consistently higher volume. Another concern is the lagging performance of small caps.


So, while the market outlook suggests investors should increase exposure to stocks, it is still a good strategy to remain cautious.


The recent market action has helped put the year-to-date gains in perspective. Individual investors haven't had to get too exotic with stock selection this year. Picking the fundamentally strong megacaps would've served investors well.


The so-called FANG stocks — **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — are outperformers this year. **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) also belong in the megacap grouping. (Netflix is the only one that arguably is not a megacap, with a $70 billion market cap.)


So far this year, Priceline is up 26%; Apple, 32%; Facebook, 30%; Amazon, 31%; Netflix, 27%; and Alphabet, 23%.


The FANG acronym alone tells the individual investor something, namely that these are long-term institutional favorites. When the stocks under a popular label cease to work, the acronym fades from widespread use, like the Nifty 50 of the 1960s and '70s, or the now-barely-mentioned BRIC stocks of about a decade ago. The Brazil, Russia, India and China play is only a piece of what it was — i.e., India is perhaps the only hot BRIC member left.


There are 44 megacaps — stocks with a market value of $100 billion or more — in IBD's database.


Other megacaps doing well this year include **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which is just above a buy point, and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), which is approaching a possible entry.


Boeing is expected to grow earnings 30% this year, which would be its best pop in seven years. The aerospace stock is trying to clear a 185.81 buy point in a flat pattern. Citigroup is just below a 62.63 buy point in a shallow consolidation. In Q1, Citigroup grew earnings 23%, which was the best in five quarters.


In the 2017 stock market, size clearly matters. The small-cap Russell 2000 is up about 2% so far this year. But the Big Cap 20 and the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ([MGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGX)) exchange traded fund are up 13% and 16%, respectively.


The biggest holdings in the Vanguard ETF are Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet.

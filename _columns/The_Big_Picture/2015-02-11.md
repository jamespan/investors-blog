Nasdaq Makes More Headway As More Growth Stocks Break Out
==========================================================

For a stock market that has been imitating jumping beans lately, Wednesday's calm session was a pleasant surprise.


The market's leading stocks, however, refused to be quiet. A majority of them made impressive moves to the upside.


Still, breakouts remain sparse.


A day after the Nasdaq composite muscled higher in stronger turnover, thus triggering a change in IBD's market outlook back to "Uptrend resumes," the major indexes traded tightly to end Wednesday little changed.


The Nasdaq composite added to Wednesday's 1.3% gain with a 0.3% lift. It closed above the psychologically key 4800 level for the first time this year.


The last time that happened, on Dec. 29, the market went on a selling spree. The Nasdaq slid five days in a row, falling more than 3% in the process. Stocks snapped back quickly, yet it's been a tug of war ever since.


The S&P 500 closed off less than 1 point. Mega caps did slightly better; the S&P 100 edged up 0.1%. The IBD 50, up 1.5% on Tuesday, ended flat. Volume changed little on both exchanges.


When a confirmed uptrend is in play, the market's bias is to the upside. More stocks will rise than fall. These are the prime conditions to buy stocks, especially those with excellent relative strength, outstanding fundamentals, and a [new factor](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/687197-it-takes-something-new-to-drive-a-stock.htm). (See the names in the "Leaders up in volume" section of the Market Pulse for examples of new breakouts.)


However, not all confirmed uptrends are alike.


The market's current choppy action is the natural consequence of a long bull run that goes back as far as the fall of 2011, or even further, to the March 2009 low. The market's gains reflect the recovery in the U.S. economy, the birth of innovative new companies, and the low cost of money, courtesy of the Federal Reserve.


In this current environment, a measured approach is wise. Be choosy about new buys. Use the pyramiding approach. Buy only half of an allotted full position, then add shares only if the stock keeps rising. Finally, continue to take profits on the upside, ideally at 20%-25% but even lower when the market gets rocky again.


While the Nasdaq was up, losing stocks on the composite beat winners by a near 5-4 ratio, a mild divergence. Yet IBD's new high list continues to outweigh new lows. Medical, retail and building stocks led Wednesday's showing. **Walgreens Boot Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) hopped 4%, clearing a 78.04 entry.

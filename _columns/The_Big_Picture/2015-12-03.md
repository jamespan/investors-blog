Stocks sold off aggressively for a second day in a row Thursday, as the S&P 500 lost its 200-day moving average.


The Nasdaq dropped 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4% each. The IBD 50 slid 1.9%.


Volume rose across the board.

The shift in outlook means investors need to be more cautious. Taking some profits, for example, would lower stock exposure.


Losses were broad. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, 13 fell for every one that rose. Defensive groups, such as food and gold miners, led the upside. Medical and apparel groups took hard hits.


Individual investors looking for shelter from the storm could've found it in the long-suffering Brazilian stocks.


Of the 29 Brazil stocks in IBD's database, all 29 rose. Brazil's Bovespa index jumped 3.3% as congress began impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. Scandals have dogged her administration, and the Brazilian economy is spinning downward.


Meanwhile, Chinese stocks provided a head fake Thursday. Early in the session, two of every three Chinese stocks trading on U.S. exchanges were up. However, by the close, two of every three were down.


The ratio was worse among U.S. stocks. On the NYSE, losers led winners by a more than 4-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, stocks falling led stocks rising by a better than 3-1 ratio.


What caused the U.S. sell-off?


Many market watchers blamed the European Central Bank, which expanded its stimulus program to March 2017 but did not increase the size.


Others were still blaming Fed chief Janet Yellen a day after she hinted at a rate hike.


Another factor that could be lingering was news late Tuesday that Citigroup sees a 65% chance of a U.S. recession in 2016.


Meanwhile, economic reports Thursday were mixed: Jobless claims in line with views; factory orders for October better than expected; PMI services for November above the consensus number; but ISM non-manufacturing for November lagged expectations.


Individual investors don't need to know the exact reason for a sell-off. Let the price-and-volume action of the indexes and holdings guide investment decisions.


Do not let losses run deeper than 7% or 8%, and take profits where appropriate.

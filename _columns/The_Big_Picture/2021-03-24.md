Stock Market Takes Another Hit; Intel News Lifts Chip-Equipment Firms, But Early Gains Fade
============================================================================================

It was another ugly session for the stock market Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed near lows after early strength, while another wave of selling hit the Nasdaq indexes and small-cap stocks. Software and biotech stocks lagged, while oil and gas stocks outperformed.




Volume rose on the Nasdaq, resulting in a second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq composite. Volume was slightly lower on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq composite slumped 2% and the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.7% as both indexes struggle below their 50-day moving averages.  The Nasdaq closed below the 13,000 level. Sharp declines by former leaders **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) weighed on the Nasdaq 100.


China stocks in the Nasdaq 100 like **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) also suffered sharp losses. The culprit was **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), which reported earnings and reminded investors that regulatory concerns are still an issue for Chinese internet firms. **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)), which is majority owned by Tencent, crashed 27%. **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) cratered 21%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After falling below its 50-day line Tuesday, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slumped another 2.3%. The S&P fell 0.5% and the Dow Jones eased less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 is still holding support at the 50-day line, but it closed below its 21-day exponential moving average, prompting a change in IBD's market outlook to "[uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/)."

![MP032421_2_](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP032421_2_-218x300.jpg)Growth stocks got knocked lower again. After slumping 4.3% Tuesday and losing support at the 50-day moving average, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost another 5%.


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers rose again, according to the latest reading from Investors Intelligence. The bulls rose to 57.4% from 55.9% the prior week and 51% the week before that. Rising bullish sentiment isn't a good thing because it's a contrarian indicator. The bulls were at 59.1% on Feb. 16, right at the start of a 12.5% pullback for the Nasdaq composite.


Crude Oil Jumps
---------------


May crude oil settled at $61.18 a barrel, up 5.9%, after a large container ship blocked the Suez Canal. About 12% of global trade passes through the canal, including 1 million barrels of oil a day. Oil slumped 6% Tuesday as new coronavirus shutdowns in Europe fueled demand concerns.


Several oil and gas-related groups outperformed, including U.S.-based oil and gas producers. Inside the group, **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)), and **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)) were among best percentage gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


Steel producers bounced back after the group slumped nearly 5% Tuesday. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) is back in buy range from a 25.85 buy point. But market choppiness makes it difficult to make any new buys with conviction.

What's clear at this point is that very little is working in the current choppy market. The rotation trade was working for a while as money flowed out of growth stocks and into cyclical stocks, but a weak market usually takes everything down with it.


A breakout in the chemical sector by **ESI Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) looked good on March 9, but it didn't take long for sellers to hit the stock. But the sector held up relatively well Wednesday, with the five sub-groups in it ending flat or slightly higher.


Airlines Fade
-------------


The U.S. Global Jets ETF ([JETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JETS)), which counts **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) as top holdings, lost ground for the fifth straight session. It's down nearly 9% for the week.



**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) led the Dow Jones early after the company said its investing $20 billion in two new chip factories in Arizona. But a 6% early gain faded to a loss of 2% by the close. Intel will continue to manufacture most of its high-end chips, but it wants to make chips for other companies, too.


Leading chip-equipment stocks rallied nicely on the news, including **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) which jumped 4%. But a 5.4% gain for IBD's chip-equipment group faded to 0.4% by the close.


Besides Intel, another tech stock that fell on seemingly good news was **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock and [Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). Earnings and sales growth accelerated from the prior quarter, up 38% and 26% respectively. But that wasn't good enough. Shares fell nearly 2% as the stock remains on a downtrend, stuck below its converged 50- and 200-day moving averages.

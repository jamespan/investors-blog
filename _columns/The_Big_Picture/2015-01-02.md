Stocks began the new year with a negative reversal as the market uptrend continued to struggle.

  

The Nasdaq fell 0.2% after being up 0.9%. The S&P 500 was flat. The IBD 50 slipped 0.3%.

  

Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.

  

The action in [the stock market Friday](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) changed nothing in the distribution day count, but the Nov. 25 stalling day fell off the Nasdaq's count because of time. After five weeks, a distribution is not relevant to current conditions.

  

For an IBD-style investor, the action of the past five weeks probably has inadvertently raised the investor's cash level.

  

How can this be? IBD investors will often take profits when a stock reaches the 20% to 25% profit level. Some of those gains no doubt are tied to breakouts of months ago. At the same time, such investors will also sell their weakest player, so that the portfolio doesn't become a collection of the walking wounded.

  

Both moves raise cash.

  

Where does the money go?

  

In an ideal uptrend, the profit-taking money (or loss-cutting money) is moved into new breakouts. Breakouts, though, fell sharply after Thanksgiving and remained scarce in December.

  

So where did the money go?

  

Nowhere. If an IBD-style investor sees no breakouts to buy, he or she does not pour money back into the market just to be buying something.

  

The result of this disciplined approach is that the cash level rises or falls naturally. This is why picking and choosing which rules you will obey hurts performance. The rules are interconnected in ways that aren't always obvious.

  

For investors who weren't taking 20% to 25% gains, perhaps because they had no gains of that size, some selling is probably in order. The market isn't showing the kind of strength that justifies heavy exposure.

  

If investors are looking for an action plan for 2015, try this for starters: Don't raise exposure until there are genuine buy candidates breaking out.

  

Economic news Friday was mixed. Factory reports in Europe were weak. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi hinted at stimulus action, but the market has heard that talk before.

  

The Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index for December was roughly in line with views, but the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index missed the consensus estimate. Construction spending for November also missed views.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq dropped 1.7%; IBD 50, 1.6%; S&P 500, 1.5%; small cap S&P 600, 1.4%; and Dow Jones industrial average, 1.2%.

Stock Market Shrugs Off China Trade Uncertainty; Disney Surges, Leads Dow
==========================================================================

A weak earnings report from **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) late Tuesday didn't have much effect on leading semiconductor stocks â€” or the stock market as a whole Wednesday. Several chip stocks outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, including **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)).




[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Advanced Micro Devices continues to perform well after a breakout from a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 35.65 buy point. Applied Materials, meanwhile, is toying with a breakout over a [three-weeks-tight-pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), another Leaderboard stock, also reports late Thursday.


After falling 0.4% early, the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked an all-time closing high, rising 0.3%. A powerful 7% surge in Disney shares helped the blue-chip index. **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) said its new [Disney+ streaming service](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-tops-buy-point-disneyplus-10-million-users/) signed up more than 10 million users since Tuesday's launch.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP_111319-255x300.jpg)The S&P 500 inched up 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lagged slightly, down 0.4%, as it continues to battle near the 1600 level. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in close to Monday's level. Nasdaq turnover rose.


The stock market pared gains in the morning after the Wall Street Journal reported that [China doesn't want to commit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-trade-talks-hit-snag-over-farm-purchases-11573671418?mod=hp_lead_pos2) to a specific dollar amount when it comes to agricultural purchases. Last month, President Trump said China agreed to purchase up to $50 billion in U.S. farm goods as part of a preliminary trade deal.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed with a 0.4% gain. **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) jumped 2.6% in higher volume as gold and utility stocks outperformed. Kirkland Lake is back above its 50-day moving average as it forms a late-stage base.



Two other top-rated gold stocks are setting up in sound bases. **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) is just below a 61.77 [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) buy point. **Franco Nevada** ([FNV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNV)), in today's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-stocks-to-watch-why-franco-nevada-stock-acts-more-like-growth-stock/), is near the top of a flat base with a 101.29 entry.


Powell Speaks, Stock Market Shrugs
----------------------------------


The stock market was indifferent to testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill. That's because his remarks didn't stray much from the last Fed policy statement released on Oct. 30. Powell on Wednesday said that monetary policy will likely "remain appropriate" even as the Fed foresees a "sustained expansion of economic activity," helped by three straight rate cuts. The main take-away is that the Fed is on hold with rate hikes unless economic conditions worsen materially.


Inflation remains near the Fed's preferred 2% target, although consumer prices came in a bit hotter than expected in October. Overall, prices rose 0.4%, slightly above the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Year-over-year, prices rose 1.8%, just above the consensus of 1.7%. But the market seemed to focus more on core prices, which rose 0.2%. That was in-line with expectations. Year-over-year, core prices rose 2.3%, a tad below expectations of 2.4%.

Money flowed into bonds Tuesday, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 5 basis points to 1.88%.


For the bulls, there's still a lot to like about the confirmed uptrend. Leading growth stocks are acting quite well and [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) remain well contained.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Among the day's gainers, **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) soared nearly 17% to 40.19 after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss as well as its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Datadog provides a cloud-based data analytics platform that's seeing strong demand. Sales jumped 88% from the year-ago period to $95.9 million.

Datadog, which went public in September at 27, broke out powerfully from a double-bottom base with a 38.07 buy point. It briefly topped its all-time high of 41.44.


Meanwhile, chipmaker **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)) was a top gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up 1.7%. It's only 8% off its high as it forms the right side of a cup-shaped base.

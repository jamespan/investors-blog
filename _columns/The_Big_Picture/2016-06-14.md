The stock market fell for the fourth day in a row, although the results at the end of the day suggest that selling was cooling off.


The Nasdaq, which had been down as much as 0.8%, closed with a minimal loss of 0.1%. The S&P 500 also ended down less than 0.2%. Volume rose on both major exchanges. Losers led winners by nearly 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by 3 to 2 on the Nasdaq.


![MP_061416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP_061416.jpg)The positive reversals suggested that the wave of selling is abating. The reversals were all the more noteworthy (if not encouraging) because the Nasdaq bounced right around its 200-day moving average. To chart readers, such behavior indicates the end of a price trend.


A key sentiment gauge, the put-call volume ratio, was at 1.01 Tuesday. That's not quite enough fear in the crowd to mark a bottoming sign. It has been trending higher, though, having reached 1.07 on Friday.


The S&P 500 deducted a distribution day from its count because the May 9 stalling day is now too dated to matter anymore.


But the broad indexes remained below their 50-day moving averages Tuesday, a reminder that the market's fabric is not silky smooth but more like worn fleece. The rapid four-day descent wiped away at least two weeks of index gains and left many leading stocks below or back near buy points.


Reflecting the sudden deterioration, IBD on Monday changed its outlook to uptrend under pressure. That means investors need to recalibrate their expectations. Even if the market can bounce, it could end up being just a short-term reflex.


It is now important to be especially picky about buying stocks. If you do buy, invest in portions, adding shares as the stock proves its leadership. Cutting losses short is now paramount. Even a loss of 3% or 4% makes sense if the chart is going the opposite way it should. Generally, exposure to stocks should be limited, and buying on margin is especially dangerous.


IBD 50 members **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) are below buy points and are in risky situations.


The Dow transports shed 1.4% as [airline stocks spearheaded the sector's decline](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-continue-to-plummet-amid-perfect-storm/). Carriers have suffered this week after the Orlando, Fla., mass shooting fanned worries about global terrorism. Also, next week's Brexit vote is keeping some business travelers at home. IBD's airline industry group is down nearly 5% so far this week.


Britain's referendum on whether to stay in the European Union looms as a potential disruption in global markets, and that's one reason Wall Street has been falling.


The referendum is creating uncertainty, and that concern was all too evident in Tuesday's [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=downs) table. Some stocks from the U.K. and other European nations fell in higher-than-normal volume, including **Diageo** ([DEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEO)), **Unilever** ([UL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UL)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) and **Total** ([TOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOT)).


Banking and other financials also saw more selling as the market girded itself for Wednesday's decision on interest rates. The Fed is not expected to raise rates this time, but there's a bigger question about what it plans to do in July and the rest of the year.


The IBD 50 fell 0.1% Tuesday. **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) are a couple of its winners, both up more than 10% from buy points. **VCA Inc.** ([WOOF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WOOF)) made a bullish reversal and it found support at the 5o-day moving average.

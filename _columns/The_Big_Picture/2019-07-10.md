Stock Market Rises On Rate-Cut Hopes; Amazon, Facebook Follow Through
======================================================================

The stock market liked the sound of a dovish Fed chairman Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite marked all-time highs, and the S&P 500 crossed the 3000 level for the first time. On top of that, FANG stocks **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) followed through after clearing buy points Tuesday.




Fed Chairman Jerome Powell [testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chief-powell-fed-rate-cuts-congress-testimony/). He covered a lot of ground, saying that uncertainties continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. "Economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy," Powell said. He also said the Fed's outlook didn't change in light of Friday's strong jobs report.


The Nasdaq ended with a gain of 0.7% and the S&P 500 added nearly 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrials picked up 0.3% as it closes in on the 27,000 level. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today â€” a solid day of accumulation.

Today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/pagseguro-digital-stock-time-to-sell/) explained why it might be a good time to take profits in PagSeguro.


More Rate Cuts Ahead?
---------------------


Late Tuesday, the chances for a quarter-point cut at the Sept. 18 Fed meeting were around 57%. But the percentage jumped to around 75% around 9 a.m. ET after Powell's testimony was released. The chances for a third rate cut before the end of year rose to better than 50%.


At the June meeting, the Fed signaled a July rate cut by dropping a prior vow to stay patient. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.10% before the release of Powell's testimony but back off to 2.06% around 2 p.m. ET.


U.S. crude oil futures jumped 4.5% to $60.43 a barrel after weekly U.S. supply data showed a decline in crude inventories for the fourth straight week. Oil was also strong on fears of a brewing storm in the Gulf of Mexico.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Amazon blew past the 2,000 level with conviction after Tuesday's breakout over a 1,964.50 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares jumped 1.5% to 2,017.41. Facebook was also impressive, rising 1.8% to 202.73. It's still in the 5% buy zone from the 198.58 entry.


**T-Mobile US** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) gapped up and drew closer to the 81.03 entry. Shares closed at 78.63, up nearly 5%. The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) name is replacing Red Hat in the S&P 500. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) just completed its acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion.


**CareDx** ([CDNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNA)) jumped 2.5% to 39.53. It's approaching an alternate entry of 40.60 after finding support at the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/add-trading-playbook-rebound-10-week-line/).



**Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)) added 2.5% to 170.03. After a low-volume breakout over a 162.60 entry, the medical device maker is approaching an alternate entry of 170.10.


Bullishness On The Rise
-----------------------


Meanwhile, the latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers showed an increase in bullish sentiment to 56.7% from 55.2%. Bullish sentiment hit 56.4% in late April just ahead of market pullback. It's a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen at market tops in the past. And excessive bearishness has been seen at several market bottoms.


The new numbers are good fodder for the bear camp, but stock market bulls have plenty to be happy about because a large number of top-rated growth stocks continue to behave well. New breakouts are emerging, and recent breakouts are holding up well. There are new setups to consider as well amid mild signs of distribution in the major stock indexes. In short, the market uptrend is proceeding well.


**Boston Beer** ([SAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAM)) hasn't given anything back after a breakout over a 353.12 entry. Neither has **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), which recently cleared a cup-shaped based with a 51.93 buy point.

**Herman Miller** ([MLHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLHR)), meanwhile, continues to trade tightly near highs after soaring nearly 20% in the last week of June. A strong earnings report was the catalyst.


**Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) picked up 1.7% to 73.30. It's closing in on a 75.38 [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) entry.

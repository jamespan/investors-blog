Major averages extended their winning streaks to three sessions Friday, but signs of institutional buying in the major averages remain few and far between.


After rising above its 50-day moving average Thursday, the Nasdaq outperformed again, rising 0.8%. Breadth was pretty good as Nasdaq advancers topped decliners by a nearly 3-to-1 margin.


The S&P 500, meanwhile, rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 marked a new closing high and came to within 1 point of its all-time high of 1,902 set on May 13. Don't get too excited, though, because seven of the S&P 500's past eight gains have come in bone-dry volume.


Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE volume dropped 15% from Thursday's levels ahead of the three-day weekend. The stock market will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day.


For the week, the Nasdaq jumped 2.3%; the S&P 500 added 1.2% and the Dow gained 0.7%. The IBD 50 outperformed, rising 2.8%.


In economic news, one day after April existing-home sales came in below expectations, Wall Street was cheered after new-home sales topped expectations.


Sales of new single-family homes rose 6% to 433,000 in April. March new-home sales were revised higher to 407,000 from an initially reported 384,000.


The market-friendly Fed has been scaling back its monthly asset purchases and considering when to raise interest rates, but the minutes from the April 30 meeting showed that tightening was not imminent amid a still-sluggish economic recovery. Most analysts expect the Fed to continue tapering in the near-term, with rate hikes starting in mid-2015. An overall dovish Fed is generally keeping sellers at bay.


The market's tone has improved in recent days, but hesitant gains in light volume aren't the stuff of new market uptrends.


Still, a confirmed market uptrend can't be ruled out in the coming days.


For growth investors, a defensive posture is still best. If you nibble at a stock or two, keep those stocks on a tight leash. You'll know soon enough if a new buy is acting right. If it isn't, cut losses short.


Friday's listless session didn't offer up much in the way of breakouts, but **Tenneco** ([TEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEN)) had a good day. Shares rose 2% in higher volume. It closed nearly 2% above a 62.32 flat base buy point.


Elsewhere, **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) jumped above its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings report this week. Shares rose 3% in higher volume. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of 68 cents a share, up 36% from a year ago.


New issue **Enable Midstream Partners** ([ENBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENBL)) is setting up in an IPO base. Other top-rated names forming bases include **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).

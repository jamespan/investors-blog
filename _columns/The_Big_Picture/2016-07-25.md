The stock market fell Monday as it continued to moderate its summertime advance.


The S&P 500 eased 0.3% and the Nasdaq 0.1% as both pared losses. The S&P 500 closed in the upper half of the day's price range and the Nasdaq nearly made it to positive territory after being down as much as 0.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE. That gave the S&P 500 a third distribution day since the follow-through of June 30, albeit it mild form. Losing stocks led winners by a 9-5 ratio on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


![MP072516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP072516-184x300.jpg)Both main indexes held within a tight trading range that's developed in the past week and a half. Indexes have stalled, but that pause is serving an important purpose by digesting the burst that began June 28.


Nowhere is this stalling more evident than on the Russell 2000. The small-cap benchmark has gone horizontal since July 13, much more than the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The Russell's chart seems more indicative of today's market, where the easy gains are gone and stocks now must labor harder to make headway.


Nevertheless, the Russell 2000 is holding above the 1200 price level. That mirrors the S&P 500, which has ceded little since its ascent to record highs.


That was no small victory for the S&P 500. For more than a year, the index probed the 2100 level, only to encounter resistance multiple times. Indeed, the conquest into new highs is a significant goal the market has reached, and one it now has the responsibility of defending. The Nasdaq still has to battle prior highs around 5170, and that's the next hurdle.


So far, there's been little distribution to bother the market, and the few distribution days haven't shown drastic losses. The IBD 50 climbed 0.4% Monday, outperforming the market.


Of course, earnings season is now in full force, elevating risk. Investors must tread carefully, especially with stocks that have little cushion above buy points. The Fed announces its latest policy direction on Wednesday -- another potential for disruption in financial markets.


On Monday, energy stocks lagged the most after the price of crude oil hit a three month low on supply worries. Metals also were broadly weaker. Transportation stocks were noticeably weaker, as the Dow transports shed 0.9%.


Building stocks continued their leadership role, and to provide a high share of breakouts.


**BMC Stock Holdings** ([BMCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMCH)), a supplier of flooring, doors, windows and other home-construction materials, cleared the 20.09 buy point of a cup-shaped base in heavy trading.


**Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) jumped 2% in 2 1/2-times its normal volume. The stock is still in buy range from an 83.10 buy point.

Coronavirus Rebound Puts On The Brakes; S&P 500 Fails This Technical Test
==========================================================================

Covid-19, no doubt, still acts as an invisible enemy to human life. But on Tuesday, trepidation in the stock market was clearly visible.




The view from current market leaders? Not as bad, however, for now.


While former market leaders such as FAANG firms **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and Google-owning **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) stumbled and dropped back below their key 10-week moving averages, new emerging leaders did not do as badly.


Data security giant **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) struggled. A weak-volume breakout by the [IBD Big Cap 20 play](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) past a 112.09 [thin-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) has reversed badly.


Coronavirus Stock Market Rebound Doesn't Smack All Leaders
----------------------------------------------------------


Yet Tuesday's pullbacks by **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) **ResMed** ([RMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMD)) and cannabis idea **Scotts Miracle-Gro** ([SMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMG)) appeared normal.



The latter two recently got showcased in [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) and [Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-top-marijuana-play-near-buy-point-before-earnings/), respectively. [Fortinet's handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) can only be seen on its daily chart.


The Nasdaq composite gapped down at the open, and the session's gap between Tuesday's high (8479) and Monday's low (8553) never got closed. Its nearly 3.5% drubbing marked the worst single-session drop since the key index [notched a follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on April 6.


Since that follow-through day, the Nasdaq has rallied as much as 9.7% through Monday's peak. After this hefty run, any index deserves a break. Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq; thus, the index still has zero distribution days on the Market Pulse. (For more detailed analysis on the recent big gains in the Nasdaq, please check out the latest post in the [IBD Weekend Stock Market Update](https://www.investors.com/tag/weekend-stock-market-update/).)

Just A Pause?
-------------


[As seen on a daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), the index closed mildly below the 50-day moving average. In a normal bull market, the major equity indexes lead their 50-day lines higher. That's not the case now. The Nasdaq's 50-day moving average crested on Feb. 26, precisely one day after the [IBD outlook for stocks worsened to "market in correction,"](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) the most negative phase for the market trend.


The S&P 500 failed on Monday to hold above its own 50-day moving average after retaking it last week. On Tuesday, the large-cap gauge sank more than 3%.


Some of the S&P 500's sectors are acting just as weakly. Please see the SPDR Sector Utility ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)). Its attempts to climb back above the 50-day line repeatedly failed for more than a week. The SPDR Consumer Discretionary ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) exchange traded fund just got turned away at its own 50-day moving average as well.


Yet, as noted on [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958), the S&P 500 is respecting its 21-day exponential moving average for now.


The Russell 2000 held up better Tuesday. It lost 2.3%.


Bearish Headlines Dominate
--------------------------


The Senate late Tuesday approved a new $484 billion rescue bill to help replenish loans for businesses and provide more financial aid to hospitals. But it still needs to get passed in the House of Representatives before it can reach President Donald Trump's desk.


Oil and gas companies appear to have less impact on market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&P 500. Yet the chaos in the West Texas Intermediate oil futures market undoubtedly raises a red flag over the current state of the economy. On Tuesday, the June-expiring oil futures contract plunged 43% to $11.50 a barrel. The [expiring May contract for oil went below zero](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-still-face-brutal-market-forces-negative-us-crude-contract-expires/).


"Putting aside supply issues and various WTI contract technicals, the devastation wreaked on the oil market by the sharp drop in global activity contrasts sharply with the recent strong performance of U.S. equity indices. This dislocation perhaps reflects the fact that positioning and Federal Reserve driven technicals, rather than fundamentals, have been the drivers behind the equity market's stellar performance in recent weeks," Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said in an email to IBD.


"Certainly, if the ongoing COVID-19 disruption lasts longer and into 2021, sustaining the depressed level of oil prices, risk assets including equities may even retest the lows seen at the depths of the crisis," Shah added.


A Return Of Higher Coronavirus Stock Market Volatility?
-------------------------------------------------------


Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the U.S. will coordinate a reopening of the economy. Will states take the lead? To what extent will the White House be able to persuade California, New York and other key business centers to speed up the relaxing of current stay-at-home orders?


Anxiety also returned in the form of higher options volatility. [The Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) jumped for a second day in a row. But at 45.36, it still lies well below a March peak of 85.47.

The stock market on Tuesday looked all too familiar â€” selling off after a recovery ran out of steam near new highs.




The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 1.1%, the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9% and the S&P 500 was down 0.8%. The S&P 500 and Dow rolled back to their 50-day moving averages, which have been serving as a gauge of the market's trend. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1%.


The primary reason for the selling rested on North Korea, again. The government of Pyongyang announced Sunday that it had developed a hydrogen warhead that can be attached to a long-range missile. It was the latest scare in the standoff over North Korea's nuclear missile program.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MP090517.png)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That gives the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). At the same time, the July 31 distribution day expired, which left the Nasdaq with seven days of higher-volume losses. The S&P 500 also has seven, which is enough distribution to raise alarm.


It was, however, the first distribution day on the Nasdaq since Aug. 17. The indexes had been rebounding for about two weeks and got to the doorstep of new highs until Tuesday's sell-off. But as they often have done in the past many months, sellers showed up in a one-day mass to erase much of the recovery.


It was easy for Tuesday's volume to increase because Friday's trading was one of the slowest of the year ahead of the Labor Day weekend.


Still, there were signs that Wall Street was nervous and selling in droves. Losing stocks led winners by a 7-to-3 ratio on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


Some defensive industry groups such as discount retailers and utilities were among the best-performing Tuesday. A flight to safety was apparent, as gold prices rose and bond prices jumped.


Gold climbed to $1,338.97 an ounce, the highest in a year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 10 basis points to 2.07%. That's the lowest since Nov. 10, when yields spiked on the surprise electoral victory of Donald Trump.


As yields slid, banking stocks were left dazed. SPDR S&P Bank ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)), one of the most widely held banking ETFs, fell 3% to its lowest level since May 31.


Will the indexes get back up, as they've done other times when losses were sharp?


Investor fear spiked, and excessive worry has marked at least short-term lows in stocks. The [put-call volume ratio](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) climbed to 1.08. That's close to the 1.15 that has coincided with market lows. The [CBOE Market Volatility Index](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, climbed more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, another signal of a bottom. This happened with the index lows a couple of weeks back. It suggests, just like it did then, that the market's downside is limited.


There's also recent history to consider. The market's trend has been one of sharp but brief sell-offs that are followed by recoveries in which indexes spend only a limited time at new highs. That may sound frustrating, but it's the definition of an uptrend.


The Nasdaq, Dow and S&P 500 have traded above their 50-day moving averages for most of the year.


Several high-rated stocks tried to break out, but all fizzled.


**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) topped the 108.65 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), but erased most of its gains to close below the entry.



**Neogen** ([NEOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEOG)), **Louisiana-Pacific** ([LPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPX)), **Kaiser Aluminum** ([KALU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KALU)) and **Inogen** ([INGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INGN)) moved above [buy points](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) but reversed lower or closed below the entries.


The energy sector gave the market something to latch onto. Crude prices rose $1.25 to $48.54 a barrel. There were signals that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could extend its output limits beyond the first quarter of 2018. Gasoline futures fell as refining capacity that had been shut due to Hurricane Harvey came back online.

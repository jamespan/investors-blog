Stocks staged a positive reversal Friday, turning big losses at the open into solid gains by the close.

  

The Nasdaq scored a 1.7% advance after being down 1.6%. The S&P rose 1.4%. The IBD 50 lagged with a 1% pop.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges.

  

The gains in rising volume pointed to institutional buying.

  

The S&P 500's thrust came on Day 4 of an attempted rally, which along with the volume and price gain qualify as a follow-through day.

  

A follow-through day confirms that an uptrend is underway. This means quality stocks now can be bought as they break out of valid bases or bounce off the 50-day line in strong volume.

  

Individual investors should proceed deliberately, trying a buy or two. Not all follow-through days work. However, since gut feelings are useless in the stock market, investors should always test a rally. Neither jumping in aggressively nor refusing to buy anything makes sense.

  

The market itself will tell investors whether they should add or reduce exposure. There is no need to rely on feelings.

  

On Friday, beaten-down groups provided most of the day's leadership. Gold miners, and oil and steel stocks were up. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, winners led losers by an 11-1 ratio, according to preliminary data.

  

On the downside, banks suffered the most damage.

  

Banks and S&Ls have outperformed the market recently, perhaps on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon, and banks therefore will enjoy better margins.

  

On Friday, an ugly payrolls report heightened conviction — at least in some quarters — that the Federal Reserve won't raise rates soon.

  

For some time now, the stock market has been operating on a gloom and room-to-run theory. As long as economic data were weak, the Fed wouldn't dare raise rates.

  

Yet, the action didn't entirely fit the scenario. Stocks darted down at the open despite the payrolls report before the open. The positive reversal started about an hour after the open.

  

The report, though, was ugly. The September payrolls figure was 30% below the consensus view and 21% below the most pessimistic estimate in the range.

  

Factory orders for August also soundly missed the Street's consensus estimate.

  

Although the market is now in a confirmed uptrend, conditions aren't ideal. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are about 3% to 5% under their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This means the rally could face early tests.

  

As discussed in Friday's Big Picture, markets that showed sharp and quick sell-offs — such as August 2011 and May 2010 — took about four months to recover. (This market had a sharp and fast sell-off in late August.)

  

However in the 2010 and 2011 cases, follow-through days of varying quality occurred during the four months of chopping around.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq inched up 0.4%, while the S&P 500 added 1%. The IBD 50 lost 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.8%.

  

In the coming week, **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)) and **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) will kick off the third-quarter earnings season. Both companies will report Tuesday.

  

Other companies reporting later in the week include **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)).

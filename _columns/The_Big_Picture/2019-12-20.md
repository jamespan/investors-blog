Eight weeks after IBD's Market Pulse noted a change in the current outlook for growth stocks, Wall Street continued to show a penchant for equities.




The Nasdaq capped a 2.1% advance for the week with a 0.4% lift Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones transports rolled 0.9% higher as crude oil fell 1.3%. Small caps lagged a bit, but still made more progress. The S&P SmallCap 600's early 0.4% gain shrank to less than 1 point. Yet it managed to score a seventh gain in eight sessions. At 1022, the S&P 600 has bolted 7.8% higher for the quarter.


[The Oct. 15 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/growth-stocks-surprising-gains-market-outlook-shifts/) noted strengthening market action that justified an upgrade in the outlook to "Uptrend resumes" from "Uptrend under pressure." While the market has experienced a few small bumps in recent months, the overall trend has been bullish. A [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Aug. 13 gave a timely hint that IBD readers should actively invest in new market leaders and [good breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP122019-263x300.jpg)Volume surged on both exchanges Friday as options on weekly and monthly stocks and indexes expired. Yet even without the "quadruple witching" boost, the entire week showcased healthy institutional demand for shares of companies with outstanding fundamentals and superior relative strength.


See **NMI** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)), a play on the private mortgage insurance market. Ranked [No. 2 in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) headed into Friday's trade, the Nasdaq-listed small cap slid a bit but still finished the week up more than 3%. Volume doubled vs. its 10-week average as shares cleared a narrow consolidation that offered an aggressive entry point at 34.60.


Notice on a weekly chart how the stock staged a beautiful reversal in the week ended Dec. 6. At the low of 30.74 that week, the stock came right to the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of its latest base, which had the elements of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). The handle's high of 30.64, plus 10 cents, gave the [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



NMI was among dozens of stocks that got discussed during the [daily IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live). You didn't have to wait for the recent good news on housing starts or the NAHB survey (as highlighted in [IBD's economic calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)) to buy. NMI's breakout on Nov. 7 gave the best hint that a new price run was in the works.


Beyond Nasdaq: Three No-Nos
---------------------------


With six trading days still left in 2019, it may be tempting to throw caution to the wind. But smart portfolio management rules do not have any exceptions. While you might be tempted to chase a stock beyond the 5% buy zone, that's a true no-no — except in the case of a [powerful breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/).


Two more no-nos? Don't buy too early.



**Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) looked liked it was forming the right side of a new base just fine and dandy. But the past few days showed that selling pressure is still intense. Finally, don't settle for penny stocks or laggards. They may never rally in a meaningful way as true leaders stay in strong uptrends and offer follow-on buy points.



You could buy nearly 120 shares of **J.C. Penney** ([JCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCP)) with the money to purchase one share of **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)). But the former is seen losing 86 cents a share in fiscal 2021; the latter, whose stock is up 29% since its August breakaway gap, posted EPS growth of 12%, 17%, 24% and 25% in the past four quarters.


According to IBD Stock Checkup, Target shines brightly with a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) on a scale of 1 (Scrooge-like) to 99 (Santa level).


The Composite Rating combines fundamental, technical and institutional ownership criteria.


Those stocks that hold a 90 Composite Rating or higher tend to offer nicer presents to those who [buy correctly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) — and when the [market is in solid footing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/).

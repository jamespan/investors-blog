title: Nasdaq, Small Caps Lead Decline; Watch This Key Sector Of The Economy

The Nasdaq and small caps paced a broad sell-off on Wall Street on Monday. No doubt, few equity trading desks on Wall Street opted to extend their Thanksgiving vacation. But after weeks of brisk market gains, December's weak start looked normal for a session that featured numerous disappointing headlines.




Some of the headlines in fact helped the market get off to a somewhat positive start, including encouraging numbers in China's manufacturing sector.


But another drop below the neutral 50 reading in November for the [ISM manufacturing index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and a threat by President Trump to restore tariffs — this time on Brazil and Argentina's steel and aluminum products — greased the wheels for the sharpest slide in stocks in nearly two months.


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.1%. A significant drop for sure, but it also represents a small part of the 3.7% advance marked by the leading index in October and a 4.5% gallop higher in November. The Nasdaq 100 also declined 1.1%.


Software Industry Groups Hit Hard
---------------------------------


A fistful of software industry groups did much worse, sinking 2.5% or more for the day. (See the full daily performance list at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) and go to Industry Group Rankings.) A few retail groups also helped lead the downside, including discount and variety chains, home furnishings and consumer electronics.


Small caps naturally fell harder, as the latest data heightened concern about the state of the slowing economy. The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped nearly 1.2% while Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost more than 1.4%. The S&P 500, cushioned by gains in some cyclical stocks, still fell 0.9%.


Volume rose sharply vs. Friday's 3-1/2-hour holiday-shortened session. But on the Nasdaq, Monday's turnover also appeared to pale vs. the total seen a week ago, when the tech-rich index ripped 1.3% higher and volume bulged to more than 2.2 billion shares.


NYSE turnover topped 3.1 billion shares — 3.15 billion to be more precise. That still came in more than 200 million shares lower than the 3.38 billion shares that exchanged hands on Monday last week.


Nonetheless, Monday's session technically notched a fresh distribution day, or instance of heavy selling by fund managers, banks, insurers and the like.


Ironically, steel, steel alloy and diversified operations firms actually rallied amidst the tariff news. Yet keep in mind that these groups have been lagging for most of the year.


Breadth in the market weakened, as to be expected. Losing issues swamped winners by a roughly 5-2 margin on both main exchanges.


Beyond Nasdaq: Fear Jumps Some
------------------------------


As today's Market Pulse table highlights, more growth stocks showed big declines in heavy volume. That's normal. But not a few companies also showed light declines in quiet trade. That's ideal action during a pronounced day of profit-taking by fund managers.


Angst over how the economy will track in the coming months was clearly on display, at least from the viewpoint of options traders. The CBOE Market Volatility Index, or [the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), surged almost 16% and hit levels last seen in mid-October. You can track it daily at IBD's [Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).


Yet **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) all pulled back in constructive fashion. And a few leaders even edged mildly higher.



**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), two big winners in recent years, struggled. But **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) got today's nod as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


A Great Business Barometer?
---------------------------


Serious weakness in enterprise software would truly strike a dark note for the economy. Market observers note that in general, business software providers face less risk from the lingering U.S.-China tariff spat than, say, export-happy semiconductor designers and equipment makers.


If you've been reading the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rate policy this year, you know that it has not been impressed at all by the dour state of corporate spending — or in the central bank's words, "business fixed investment."


Investors will also also watch upcoming [reports on the economy](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) later this week, including the ADP private sector payrolls and ISM services sector index on Wednesday, and the non-farm jobs report on Friday.

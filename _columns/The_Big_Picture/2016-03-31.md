Stocks loitered near the break-even line Thursday, as the market awaited Friday's report on the employment situation for March. The Nasdaq was a sliver above flat, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each trimmed 0.2%. The IBD 50 added 0.1%.


Volume declined on the Nasdaq but edged up on the NYSE. The S&P 500 picked up a distribution day.


Advancers vs. declining issues reflected a lack of vibrancy. On the Nasdaq, losers barely outnumbered winners. Yet, winners led losers by a 6-5 ratio on the NYSE.

Leadership was quiet, as it has been for some time. Breakouts haven’t led to much. Follow-up action has been tentative and slow to build profit cushions.


A look at some institutional favorites suggest that more patience may be necessary. Take, for instance, the biggest holdings of the A+ rated funds.


(The information boxes on "Growth Funds Leading The Market" -- which often runs in IBD's mutual funds pages -- spotlights two funds most days. Page A6 in Wednesday's IBD was the most recent spotlighting of an A+ fund.)


Often the same names show up in the A+ funds: **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), for example.


How are the favored stocks performing?


Some are still building the right side of bases, though an aggressive investor can sometimes find an early entry. Others are near buy points but haven't yet cleared a legitimate buy point.


Yet they all have one thing in common: Weekly volume has been below average now for seven to nine weeks.


If elite stocks are demanding patience, how much more necessary is that for the rest of the top-rated stocks?


Economic news was mixed Thursday.


Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported planned layoffs faded for the second month in a row. However, layoffs are up about one-third on a year-ago basis. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims rose to a two-month high.


On a brighter note, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index came in at 53.6 for March, easily topping the Street's 50.3 consensus estimate. The employment component was unexpectedly strong.


The Street expects the employment situation report for March to check in at 210,000 more jobs. Estimates range from 175,000 to 241,000. The data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.

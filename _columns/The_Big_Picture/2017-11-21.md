The main indexes got back to making new highs Tuesday, a day that saw technology stocks underscore their market leadership.




The Nasdaq composite — a technology gauge because of its heavy [47% weighting in that sector](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Breakdown/COMP) —  jumped 1.1%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.7%. It was the first new closing high on the S&P 500 and Dow since Nov. 8.


The Russell 2000 added 1% and also made an all-time high after the small-cap index cleared a 31-day consolidation. Most other times the small-cap index made new highs this year, it's fallen back into a consolidation. It will be important for the Russell to follow through this time. The Nasdaq has lapped the Russell (up 11.8% since Jan. 1) with a 27.4% gain.


Volume rose on the Nasdaqand NYSE, which suggested that even in a slow Thanksgiving week there were institutional investors eager to accumulate shares at record highs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MP112117-162x300.png)Tuesday's rally left the Nasdaq 4% above its 50-day moving average. That could be a key signal because every time the composite gone that far off its 50-day line, it has pulled back from new highs. It [occurred earlier this month](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-rise-but-is-nasdaq-signaling-a-pullback/). Yet, those pullbacks have been mild, and it's been a year since the Nasdaq made a serious penetration below its 50-day line.


Indexes continue to stay almost entirely within year-old price channels, which illustrate the remarkable performance of the stock market.


Advancers beat decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq. Breadth has been improving, leaving the NYSE advance-decline line near new highs. The Nasdaq's A-D line has broken a five-week downtrend and is again pointing upward.


Breadth is important because big-cap techs have been doing the heavy lifting in the market this year, notably the FANG stocks and associated companies. Investors would rather have a broad advance rather than one that rests on a single sector.


IBD's Electronics, Computer and Chip sector are up roughly 50% in 2017, illustrating the profound leadership of the broader tech world. The Software and Internet sector are up some 35%. Techs account for half the stocks in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). The Philadelphia semiconductor index and the SPDR Technology ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rose more than 1%.


Third-quarter earnings — by all accounts another strong period of double-digit profit growth — reinforced the superb state of technology companies.


"Although the energy sector produced the most upside to estimates among the 11 sectors, energy's gains came off of a very low base with easy comparisons," John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, said in a report. "As a result, we are more impressed with the upside that the technology sector produced — more than 11% above estimates. At 24%, the earnings growth rate the sector produced in the quarter isn't too shabby. Semiconductor strength was the biggest driver, while internet and cloud computing themes were evident."



That's not to downplay the opportunities that other sectors have contributed, such as building and leisure, both up about 40% this year. Financials also have contributed to the 2017 bull market, thanks to increases in interest rates that have helped widen banks' net-interest profit margins. It's comforting to see major banks like **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) rise from support at the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).


But still plenty of future breakout and follow-on entry opportunities appear to exist among stocks in RVs, homebuilding, casinos, mortgage services, medical products and other areas. Builders **KB Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) and **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) have made impressive gains from breakouts in September.


Metal, machinery and other industrial industry groups led Tuesday's market. Semiconductor, data storage and other technology groups also led.


Homebuilder and heavy-construction industry groups were among the best performing after existing-home sales rose 2% from the previous month to a 5.48 million annual rate. The median sales price rose 5.5% from a year ago to $247,000. The National Association of Realtors report indicated that demand rose as the impact from hurricanes started to fade.

Stocks loitered around the break-even line Thursday as the indexes digested the previous session's big gains. The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average were virtually flat. The S&P 500 inched down 0.1%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 took a harder hit — down 0.4%.

  

The IBD 50 shaved off 0.1%.

  

Volume fell on both major exchanges.

  

The quiet action was more than acceptable to the bulls. After Wednesday's gains of 1.8% and 1.6% for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, the market's refusing to give back any of the gain is a good sign.

  

Yet while the market is back in a confirmed uptrend, several secondary indicators and realities aren't acting bullish.

  

•New lows continue to outnumber new highs. Which sectors are the new lows chiefly from? According to preliminary data Thursday, it was the oil, medical and retail sectors.

  

Sectors leading the new highs tally Thursday were from the banking and software sectors.

  

•The percentage of Nasdaq and NYSE stocks above their 200-day lines are roughly at 39% and 30%, respectively. The balance hasn't been above 50% since late May. Watch to see if the market can improve that ratio.

  

•Also, breakouts among quality stocks have turned scarce.

  

On the positive side, stock groups with the highest percentage of new highs include building stocks, insurance, major discount retailers and credit card payment processors.

  

That's a much healthier-looking lineup than mid-October, when utilities, tobacco and wholesale food nailed down four of the top 10 positions.

  

**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), an online networking site for professionals, is now forming a handle in a deep base. The potential buy point is 258.49. The Street expects LinkedIn to grow earnings 33% this year and 37% next year.

The managed health care stocks took a beating Thursday after **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) said that it might drop out of the ObamaCare exchange. All 13 stocks in the industry group lost ground, with losses ranging from 1% to 12%.

  

However, it's possible that UnitedHealth could be using the threat as a negotiating tactic.

  

Economic news was mostly positive Thursday.

  

The Philadelphia Fed's business survey for November, a manufacturing gauge, was better than expected: 1.9 vs. views for 0.0. It was the first positive reading since August. Leading indicators for October were 0.6, a tick above expectations at 0.5%. The 0.6 reading was the first positive reading since June.

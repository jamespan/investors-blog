The stock market sold off sharply Friday, capping the worst week since the coronavirus market crash in March. The Nasdaq composite dived as much as 3.25% on Friday before paring losses. Stock market leaders Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Tesla all suffered big declines.




The Nasdaq lost 2.45%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 traded 1.5% lower.


Leading growth stocks also fell, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF slid 2.65% on Friday.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) plunged 8.2% on Friday, [breaking down through its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The e-commerce retailer already triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 141.51 entry on Thursday.

With the major indexes and leading stocks breaking decisively on Friday and during the week, the stock market has moved into a correction.


Volume was sharply higher from Thursday's session on the Nasdaq, while slightly lower on the NYSE.


Stock Market Correction
-----------------------


Friday's weak price action ended the stock market rally that [started on Sept. 30](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/) when the Dow Jones industrials staged a bullish follow-through day.

All three major stock indexes fell further below their critical 50-day support levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to its lowest level since Aug. 3, and is testing its long-term 200-day line. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are still above their own 200-day lines.


For the week, the Dow Jones tumbled 6.5%, the S&P 500 index 5.6% and the Nasdaq composite 5.5%.


With the stock market in a correction, the distribution day count is no longer shown in the Market Pulse. A market in correction means investors should avoid new purchases. Exposure should be severely limited, and 100% cash would certainly be acceptable.


Stock market corrections seem bleak, but a new uptrend could be four days away. So don't tune out. Now is the best time to create a new watchlist of stocks that could turn into the next stock market leaders.


In particular, focus on stocks with strong relative strength. You can find the next uptrend's leaders while the market is still correcting, which can be done by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.

Stock Market Leaders Plunge
---------------------------


Stock market leaders **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) all suffered heavy losses Friday.


Amazon dropped 5.45%, Apple dived 5.6% and Facebook sold off 6.3% following their Thursday night earnings. Tesla skidded 5.55%.


One bright spot within the tech damage was Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Shares rallied 3.8% after the internet giant's strong earnings results.


Google stock is shaping the right side of a cup base, offering a 1,726.20 buy point. Meanwhile, the stock's RS line hit a new high.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [the stock has a 90](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-inc-cl-a-googl.aspx) out of a best-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.

U.S. stocks stepped higher Friday, lifting the indexes to just above the break-even line for the week.


Small caps led Friday's action with the S&P 600 sprinting ahead 1.6%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Volume in [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) was lower on both major exchanges, according to preliminary figures.


The day's big winners included banks and oil drillers. PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)), an exchange traded fund, gapped up 2% in heavy volume. So did SPDR Financial ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)), the most heavily traded financial sector ETF. The sector led after the Trump administration took steps to roll back banking regulations and ordered a delay in new rules for financial  advisors.

Despite the strength Friday, the market faces the same question it's faced for about eight weeks: What's ahead for the U.S. economy and the stock market in 2017?


A news item in the coming week might provide an answer, thanks to an index that hasn't received much attention until recently.


On Tuesday before the market's open, the National Federation of Independent Business will report its Small Business Optimism Index for January. This is a critical gauge because small businesses account for most new jobs. The hope among bulls is that the Trump administration's business-friendly policies will unleash growth. The optimism index's reading in December was 105.8, which represented the biggest month-over-month gain in 30 years.


The NFIB polls more than 600 small businesses for its report. Another strong reading would suggest economic growth will pick up in the months ahead.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *If President Trump is looking for [a strategy to boost the economy and the stock market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eisenhowers-bull-market-in-first-term-provided-a-lot-to-like/), he might tear a page from President Eisenhower's playbook.*

In other economic news Friday, nonfarm payrolls for January trounced expectations. The figure came in at 227,000, which was about 30% higher than the consensus target and 16% above the highest estimate in the range, according to Econoday. [A closer look at the data](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/227000-jobs-added-in-january-jobless-rate-4-8/), though, revealed disappointments on the wage front.


The PMI Services Index and the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index sent different messages. The PMI rose, while the ISM fell. Meanwhile, factory orders for December showed strength, popping 1.3% vs. expectations for 0.9%.


**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) broke out Friday, gapping up 5% on Thursday's strong results.


The distribution-day count improved as the Dec. 28 sell-off fell off the count because of time.

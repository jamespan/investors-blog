The bullish investor may have been disappointed by the way the stock market ended its session Wednesday — especially given the way it started. Yet, the pullback by major indexes off session highs did not disturb the overall uptrend that began in earnest at the start of November.




The S&P 500 finished the session off 4.3 points at 4550, down less than 0.1%. That marked the second decline in three sessions. However, the S&P 500 heads into Thursday's final trading session of November with a stout gain of 8.5% for the month.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq backed off less than 0.2%, or 23 points, to 14,258. Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) edged 0.1% lower. At 389.81, it has advanced a remarkable 46.4% for the year after plunging 33% in 2022.


Shiny Techs Boost The Dow
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP112923-233x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 13-point gain to 35,430, led by another rousing gain from [Leaderboard Watchlist member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)).


The giant in cloud-based enterprise software jumped another 7% to 247 after reporting October-quarter results after the close. CRM had already crossed a pair of early buy points, including an early trendline buy point near 215 and another at 228.79.

Volume grew on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges.


The Russell 2000 rose 0.6%, faring better than its large-cap sibling indexes. It nearly recouped all of the two prior days of losses. But the Russell also hit resistance at the 200-day moving average.


IBD's recommended portfolio weighting in stocks stays at a highly bullish 80%-100%. This change was made on Nov. 14, right after the stock market greeted cooler inflation data at the consumer level.


A Key Report Due
----------------


But keep an eye on Wall Street's response to another important salvo of data on prices early Thursday. The personal consumption expenditures index, well known as the PCE index, hits the wires at 8:30 a.m. ET.

---


[According to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), economists on the whole expect the core PCE index to show further mildness in inflation, up 3.5% year over year, in October. That's a drop from a 3.7% September increase. Investors will also watch for monthly personal income and spending figures for last month.


Meanwhile, some market observers judged the anecdotes of a slowing economy from Wednesday afternoon's release of the latest Beige Book survey of regions covered by Federal Reserve banks as a good reason to not get giddy about the possibility of zero recession in 2024. Earlier in the day, the U.S. government said preliminary data showed a robust 5.2% nominal rise annualized in gross domestic product for the third quarter, above the forecast for 4.9% growth.


"Obviously a more somber report (from the Beige Book) than the GDP numbers we saw this morning," Alex McGrath, chief investment office at Greenville, S.C.-based NorthEnd Private Wealth, said in an email sent to IBD. "Slowing economic activity across the board from all regions puts rate cuts back in prime focus a mere six hours later."


The yield on the principal Treasury 10-year note keeps plunging.


On Wednesday, the yield fell another 6 basis points to 4.27%, down from a peak near 5% last month. Needless to say, the government bond market has been hyper-volatile since the Fed began its rapid boost of short-term interest rates from a 0%-0.25% target range in early 2022 to 5.25%-5.5% today.


Also, the CME FedWatch tally of bond traders now says there's a 78% probability that the U.S. central bank will lower the fed funds rate by at least a quarter point at the May 1 meeting.

Surprise, Surprise
------------------


In the meantime, even when the closes on the popular indexes appeared dull, the stock market never seems to lack in surprises, does it? Even the most veteran investor might look at Wednesday's session and find it hard to ignore the contrasts one might notice between the broad brush strokes on the market canvas and the minute yet meaningful details.


Case in point: Check out the powerful rallies by **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) and **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)).


Both stocks surged so high in price that they leapt past the [standard buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) of their respective bases — 252.72 for Workday, 79.96 in a double-bottom base for NetApp.


In a strong bull market, IBD research has found that [the breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gaps-signal-unusual-strength-buy-stock-market-leaders/) can in fact produce sterling gains and shake the common sentiment among average investors that to make money in the stock market, you must buy low and sell high.

Stock Market Today
------------------


Given the bullish blast by NetApp, no wonder then that the No. 1 group on Wednesday was Computer-Data Storage, which rushed 6.3% higher. (Go to IBD Data Tables under Stock Lists at Investors.com to see the complete daily performance of all 197 IBD industry groups.)


Another strange twist in Wednesday's session? The breadth of the advance continued to widen, even though some of the major equity benchmarks softened.


Winners beat losers by nearly a 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq and almost 2-to-1 on the NYSE, early data showed. Small cap strength likely had a lot to do with it.


(For final figures, please see the S&P 500 and Nasdaq charts in the General Market Indicators page linked at the bottom of the Big Picture.)


Also consider the fact that on Wednesday, banking shares enjoyed sunny gains. Looking at the day's top industry groups, they included superregional banks up 2.8%, as well as Northeast, West and Southwest regional banks and foreign banks gaining 2.1% to 2.2%, early data showed.


Meanwhile, [panelists on IBD Live on Wednesday](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) took note of burgeoning strength in the financial sector too.


The SPDR S&P Bank ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) ETF rose 2% and appears to be surpassing an early-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 40.07. It joined [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).


Private equity giant **KKR** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)) continued to glide past a 63.27 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double-bottom-style base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Shares rallied 7.7% to 74.74 on Wednesday in heavy volume on news that it's buying the rest of insurance firm Global Atlantic for about $2.7 billion in cash.

Investor Sentiment Today
------------------------


Bulls among newsletter editors surveyed by Investors Intelligence notched a fourth straight weekly rise, now at 55.7% vs. 42.9% in the week ended Nov. 3. The bearish ratio eased further to 21.4% vs. 22.4% last week and from a near-term peak of 25.7% nearly four weeks earlier.


Stock market history has shown that the bulls vs. bears gauge can serve as an excellent indication that the bottom of a severe decline is near when bears tops bulls. But how about signals when the market is due for at least a significant pullback?


In 2023, the bulls' rise to 57.1% during the week ended Aug. 3 deserves notice. That preceded a sharp pullback across the stock market.



For instance, after the Nasdaq composite peaked at 14,446 on July 19, it experienced three miniature waves down in selling before finally bottoming out at 12,543 on Oct. 26, right underneath its 200-day moving average, to complete a healthy 13.2% correction.

Another Bearish Stock Market Signal?
------------------------------------


Ned Davis Research reported its Fab Five Sentiment Component indicator is giving a bearish signal because it "fell to its most negative reading since November of last year before improving some this week."


NDR's Sentiment Component takes into account seven individual sentiment indicators.


Based on recent readings, the Fab Five has seen much wilder swings below the neutral zero level from the spring of 2021 until now vs. the prior two-year period.


Always remember that every sentiment indicator is secondary to your primary indicator: What the stock market and leading stocks are actually doing each and every day matters more.

  Nasdaq Stumbles In Split Stock Market; Some Leading Stocks Fall Below Buy Points

The stock market seemed quite unsure of itself Tuesday. It saw everything from record highs to a bearish reversal to an afternoon rebound.




From a chart-reading perspective, the optics weren't so great.


The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average started the day with record highs. The Nasdaq composite opened mildly higher. But within minutes, the Nasdaq reversed lower and sank as much as 2%. In an afternoon bounce, it shaved its loss to 1.3% and closed just above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The S&P 500 also reversed lower but limited its loss.


From the Dec. 15 market follow-through, the Nasdaq has less than 1% left in gains from that day's close. Higher volume Tuesday gave the Nasdaq its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) since the follow-through.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP010422-188x300.jpg)Major techs **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) closed below their 50-day lines. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) made it a third straight close below its 50-day, though it continues to form a base. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) shied away from a 1,202.05 buy point.


Financials, Energy Help S&P 500
-------------------------------


The S&P 500's loss of less than 0.1% was too small for distribution. Strength in the financial and energy sectors helped the S&P to some extent.


But if the stock market indexes looked unsure, the leading stocks were more troubling.


Many have fallen below their latest [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), including **CubeSmart** ([CUBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBE)), **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) and **West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)).


On Tuesday, **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) fell below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy trading, according to [IBD MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The electronic trading platform provider is also quickly erasing gains from its 89.89 buy point.


**Endava** ([DAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAVA)) plunged more than 10%, piercing its 50-day line. A cup with handle for the builder of cloud systems is now compromised.


**Customers Bancorp** ([CUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBI)) and other financials outperformed. **Commercial Metals** ([CMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMC)), which was discussed in [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-top-steelmaker-breaks-out-before-earnings-cmc-stock/), broke out of a base.


In all, the IBD 50 lost 1.6% Tuesday.


Stock Market Pockets Of Strength
--------------------------------


But the stock market certainly had its areas of strength.


Small caps are trying to emerge as new year's leaders. The Russell 2000 dipped 0.2% but held above its 200-day line following Monday's 1.2% jump. Invesco Energy S&P Small Cap ETF ([PSCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSCE)) is up more than 11% this week, far outperforming other small cap indexes.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average performed best, up 0.6% as its financial components rallied more than 2% and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) surged back above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/).



And with yields climbing, financials feasted.


Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) rallied 2.6% and close to new highs. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) and SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) rose nearly 3%.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) led S&P sector ETFs with a 3.5% gain. The price of U.S. oil rose 1.2% to $76.99 a barrel on Tuesday, then topped $75 in overnight action.


Stock Market Breakouts In Finance
---------------------------------


More importantly, the sector saw several solid breakouts.


**Ameriprise Financial** ([AMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMP)) was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) after it broke out of a flat base with a 312.24 buy point.


**Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) jumped past the 46.02 buy point of another flat base in above-average volume.


**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) gapped up and is above the 52.66 buy point of a flat base. Volume was 79% above normal. Many regional banks also topped buy points.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note added 4 basis points to 1.67% and is near the Nov. 24 peak.


There were a few good breakouts outside of finance, too.


**Vista Outdoor** ([VSTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VSTO)) broke out of a cup-without-handle base in heavy volume. It is in buy range from the 48.85 buy point.

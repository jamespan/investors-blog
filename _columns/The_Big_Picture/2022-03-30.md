  Stock Market Falls But Note This Silver Lining; Bulls Overpower Bears In Sentiment Measure

Even the strongest bull has to stop for breath after a big charge. And that is what happened Wednesday as the stock market fell following recent strong gains.




Some consolidation is actually a good thing following handsome progress. And the fact volume was lighter on both the Nasdaq and, according to early data, the New York Stock Exchange means the current market uptrend avoided adding its first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). The fact big money is holding onto shares is a good sign.


Negative headlines over the Russia-Ukraine conflict saw investors once again back off from riskier areas, with higher valuation plays in particular giving up ground. The Kremlin said there have been no breakthroughs in talks with Ukraine while the U.S. is skeptical of Russia's claims it will reduce military activity in certain areas.


In addition, there was mixed economic news for the stock market to digest. The estimate for U.S. gross domestic product in Q4 was revised lower, from 7% to 6.9%, which was an unexpected move. Personal consumption expenditure growth estimates were also revised down from 3.1% to 2.5%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MP033022-234x300.jpg)On the positive side, private businesses hired 455,000 workers in March according to ADP and Moody's Analytics, beating views for 450,000 hires.


Nasdaq Fares Worst As Tech Struggles
------------------------------------


The Nasdaq fared worst as tech stocks were punished. It ended the day down 1.2%, which means the index may be stalling just before staging an assault on its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/). It remains above its 50-day and short-term moving averages, though.


The S&P 500 dipped by a more moderate 0.6%. It remains above all of its moving averages, and this pause prevents it from running too far ahead.


In addition, a majority of the S&P [sectors closed lower.](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) Technology and consumer discretionary were the worst performers.


A four-day win streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average came to an end, though its loss of 0.2% was slight. The Dow held above its 200-day line, which it won back on Tuesday.


Bears gave small caps the worst pasting, with the Russell 2000 falling 2%. Growth stocks also struggled, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) falling 1.4%.


Warren Buffett Stock Stumbles
-----------------------------


There was much for investors to digest among the 197 IBD industry groups.



The top performers for Wednesday were oil & gas plays, with drillers and refiners in particular faring well. Metal ore miners and diversified operators were also strong. Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB)) is a big beast in the latter group, though it posted a fractional loss for the session.


On the downside, home furnishings retailers, consumer electronics retailers and solar energy stocks were among the worst performers.


Ironically, a major loser in the home furnishings space was Warren Buffett stock **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)). The high-end retailer ended the day down more than 13% following [a disappointing outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-stock-lulu-stock-rally-with-earnings-due-after-the-close/).


RH also missed revenue estimates for the last quarter. Even the announcement of a 3-for-1 stock split, which has augured well for stocks in the past, was not enough to assuage investor concerns. Berkshire Hathaway currently holds about 1.8 million shares of RH stock.


Bulls Take Charge
-----------------


The latest advisors sentiment report from Investors Intelligence showed bullish sentiment is gaining strength. There is now a positive bull-bear spread after three consecutive reports in negative territory.


When the bears outnumber the bulls it is often a signal that the market has reached a bottom. This has proven to be the case so far in the latest instance, so hopefully rising bullish sentiment is a sign that the market rally will be in place for some time to come.


If the market can hold on here and then push higher again it could usher in a much more positive second half of 2022. As always, the day to day action of the indexes and leading stocks will be your guide.

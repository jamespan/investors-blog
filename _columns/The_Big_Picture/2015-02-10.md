A market uptrend that had been under pressure resumed in full strength Tuesday, thanks to another strong percentage gain by the Nasdaq in higher volume.

  

Tuesday's sign of strength did not mark a follow-through day by definition, but it was enough to prompt a shift in outlook in the Market Pulse to the right. Arguing with the market is a fool's game, so it makes sense to heed signs of strength when they arise.

  

The Nasdaq rose 1.3%, the S&P 500 added 1.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.8%. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 could manage only a 0.6% gain, but the IBD 50 outperformed, rising 1.5%.

  

The market's back-and-forth action in recent weeks has been tough for growth investors to navigate, but a scan through IBD growth screens shows plenty of stocks trading tightly and holding gains after breakouts. That's a good sign for the bulls.

  

The bears, on the other hand, are focusing on a stubbornly high distribution day count in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The market could take off from here — or not. Whatever the outcome, it's important to stay nimble.

  

The bulls have two other big percentage gains in higher volume for the Nasdaq in their corner — one on Jan. 8, which marked a follow-through day. The other was on Jan. 22, when the index reclaimed its 50-day moving average. Tuesday's strong showing left the Nasdaq less than 1% off its all-time high.

  

Market breadth left something to be desired. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by less than 2 to 1.

  

Still, Wall Street was in a good mood after speculation grew that Greece's new government will reach a debt agreement Wednesday at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels. Greece's current bailout agreement with the eurozone expires Feb. 28.

  

Oil and gas-related industry stocks took big hits as oil plunged again. March crude oil lost $2.84, or 5.4%, to settle at $50.02 a barrel after the International Energy Agency said oil reserves could hit a new high of 2.83 billion barrels by the middle of this year. The drilling group was the hardest hit, falling around 4.5%.

  

Airlines were a beneficiary of weakness in oil.

  

**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) soared 5% in heavy volume on strong earnings. After resetting its base count in October, the discount airline is vying for a breakout from a first-stage base with a buy point of 80.97.

  

Semiconductor and software security stocks also did well.

  

**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) touched its 50-day moving average before reversing to a 9% gain in big volume. Late Monday, the small-cap chip designer smashed views with profit of 30 cents a share, up 275% from a year ago. Sales surged 88% to $54.8 million.

  

Meanwhile, **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), an emerging leader in IBD's Computer Software-Security group, soared 13% and reclaimed its 50-day moving average after William Blair made positive comments ahead of the company's earnings report Thursday after the close.

  

Earnings reports are due Wednesday from the likes of **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Acadia Healthcare** ([ACHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACHC)) **Zoetis** ([ZTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTS)) and **AmTrust** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)).

Stock Indexes Turn South; Volume, Though, Stays Quiet

Stocks sold off in light turnover Friday as traders looked ahead to the three-day holiday weekend. The S&P 500 sliced off 1.5%, while the Nasdaq held its loss to 1%. The IBD 50 trimmed 0.9%. Volume fell on both major exchanges. The market is due to close Monday for the Labor Day holiday.

  

Bulls looking for help from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' August employment report were disappointed. Nonfarm payrolls came in at 173,000 — the most pessimistic figure in the Street's range of estimates.

  

Meanwhile, the jobless rate dipped from 5.3% in July to 5.1% in August.

  

Another positive: Payroll data for June and July were revised upward to show 44,000 more jobs than initially reported.

  

However, the workforce participation rate remained at lows not seen since the Jimmy Carter era.

  

For the Federal Reserve, the data may or may not be good enough to allow for an interest rate hike in September. The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting is scheduled for Sept. 16-17.

  

The Fed has said that its decision will be data-driven. Friday's report was mixed enough to leave analysts divided on what the Fed will decide.

  

Will the market react if the Fed acts?

  

It's possible that the reaction is what we are witnessing now. The rate hike might be already priced into the market, regardless of the Fed's exact timing. Remember, the stock market is a leading indicator, not a concurrent or lagging indicator.

  

Even surprise events are sometimes underwhelming to the market. For example, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.9% on Dec. 8, 1941, a rather restrained sell-off considering that it was the first session after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.

  

Markets are very good at anticipating problems.

  

So an additional sell-off in the market when the Fed does act may or may not be in the cards.

  

On Friday, top-rated stocks were quiet. Breakouts were missing, and new highs were scarce and unimpressive.

  

Volatility, though, continues to characterize this correction. The Nasdaq chart looks about as calm as an electric-shock therapy session.

  

One industry group with a more constructive-looking chart is the homebuilders' group. On Tuesday, the group entered the top 10 among IBD's 197 industry groups.

  

The foreclosures situation is one factor helping homebuilders. Foreclosures have been worked off and are no longer adding much drag to the housing market. (For more details, see [the foreclosures article](http://news.investors.com/business-inside-real-estate/090315-769580-foreclosure-crisis-fading-from-housing-market.htm) on Page 1 of Friday's IBD.)

  

Meanwhile, some secondary indicators are flashing signs that the market is near a bottom.

  

•Investors Intelligence's bullish advisors vs. bearish advisors gauge has changed dramatically. Six weeks ago, the contrarian gauge showed bulls at 49% and bears at 15.6%. On Wednesday, bulls were at 27.8% and bears at 26.8%.

  

The bears have nearly grabbed the upper hand in the survey, which is a bullish sign.

  

•The put-call volume ratio has been hitting levels above 1.0 and 1.2 — areas usually reached near a market bottom. The ratio closed at 1.24 Friday. However, this has been going on for weeks, seemingly with no results.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 dropped 3.7%; the S&P 500, 3.4%; the Dow Jones industrial average, 3.2%; the Nasdaq, 3%; and the small-cap Russell 2000, 2.3%.

  

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, preliminary figures showed that homebuilders led with a 1.8% gain for the week, followed by cement, up 1.6%, and manufactured housing and RVs, up 1.4%. In other words, the building sector nailed down the top three slots for the week.

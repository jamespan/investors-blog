Bull Market Hints That It Still Has Legs As Small Caps Power Higher
====================================================================

In a healthy, dynamic bull market, a single sector — let alone a single industry group — never leads the way higher the whole way. Think of good bull runs like a winning relay team. You'll likely see smooth baton passes from runner to runner.




Could we be seeing a baton-pass moment in the making?


Small caps led on Tuesday. While the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gained 1.1%, SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) followed closely. Its 0.9% advance beat gains of 0.3% by the Nasdaq composite and of less than 1 point for the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended virtually flat, down almost 0.1%.


When The Bull Market Was Under Threat
-------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP060821-198x300.jpg)Department store, restaurant, specialty retail, oil, steel, solar, airline, mortgage, select software and internet retail industry groups rallied 1.5% or more on a price-weighted basis.


Turn the clock back a month, and it looked like blue chips were becoming the only game in town left for stock pickers.


Small caps began to sour. Tech entered its second significant pullback of the year. Only benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average appeared to move with grace and poise. Have you seen what **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) have been doing lately?


A look at the action on May 12 hammers this point home.


At the end of that session, only the S&P 500 and the Dow still held above their respective [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The Nasdaq composite got throttled by sellers. Down 2.7% for the day, that session perhaps made IBD readers feel like tech stocks were going to lead a new [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/) that threatened a deeper market drop.


The Nasdaq 100 looked no different. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), down 2.6% on May 12, dropped almost 8% from its April all-time high. Volume fell just a bit that session vs. the prior day, negating the chances of a [new distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). No matter. IBD still downgraded the outlook for stocks on May 12 to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend."



If you had kept an eagle eye on the cost of money, however, you would have noticed a dramatic change.


The Cost Of Money Falls
-----------------------


On May 12, Cboe data showed the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond's yield closing at 1.69%, a five-week high. But since then, yields have faded. On Tuesday, the yield fell 4 basis points to 1.52%. Friday's U.S. jobs data for May has strengthened the Federal Reserve's case for not hurrying to end its policy of keeping interest rates at ultralow levels in order to keep the economy growing.



"We have repeatedly asserted that the change in monetary policy announced by the Fed at last year's Kansas City Fed Annual Economic Symposium was a radical departure from the preemptive approach market participants have come to expect over the past 40 years," Steve Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities USA, wrote in a note to clients.


"The new, reactive, progress-based approach has come under increasing criticism from the inflation hawks as well as the bond vigilantes," Ricchiuto added. "However, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note continues to trade just below the midpoint of the range experienced over the past 10 years, suggesting these fears are not as widely shared as the financial press portrays."


The U.S. central bank meets on interest rates in a two-day meeting starting June 15.

Stock Market Today
------------------


In the meantime, the stock market's technicals continue to improve.


On Tuesday, hundredsmore Nasdaq stocks (2,035, according to data collected by IBD) rose than NYSE stocks did (1,563). And the Nasdaq's advance-decline line continues to muscle higher as winners outran losers by a 5-3 ratio. IBD's General Market Indicators page shows that the Nasdaq's A-D line is at its highest levels since mid-March. (The indicators are on [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) on Investors.com and in a link below.)



On Tuesday, the Nasdaq rose enough to knock out the May 18 distribution day as irrelevant. Only the Nasdaq declines in higher volume on May 4, May 10 and June 3 matter on the Market Pulse for now.


Volume soared more than 27% on the Nasdaq vs. Monday. A lot of that gets traced to **Clover Health** ([CLOV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLOV)), which apparently is a new darling among WallStreetBets traders on Reddit. The health insurance provider catapulted 85% for the day as 714 million shares exchanged hands — 589 million shares more than on Monday's big gain.


**TuSimple** ([TSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSP)), a new startup focusing on autonomous-driving systems for long-haul trucks, screamed past a 41.60 buy point in its first base since going public at $40 a share. But software bot expert **UiPath** ([PATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATH)) fell sharply after hours following [quarterly results issued after the close](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/uipath-stock-uipath-earnings-path-news-q12021/). A breakout attempt past a narrow cuplike IPO base at 83.50 reversed badly.

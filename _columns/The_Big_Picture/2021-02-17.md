The stock market ended mixed Wednesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed higher. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 cut into sharp losses, while tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) tested a key support level.




The Nasdaq slipped 0.6% after tumbling as much as 1.7%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7%. The S&P 500 inched lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3% after both indexes bounced from session lows.


Leading growth stocks sharply lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 1.7% Wednesday, even after trimming some losses. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) dived 13.8%. Shares showed signs of a [climax top](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/) in recent sessions.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE vs. Tuesday.


Stock Market Rally
------------------


![MP021721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MP021721-240x300.jpg)The Nasdaq declined for a second straight day Wednesday. Despite the sharp sell-off midday, volume measured lower than Tuesday, so there was no new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) added.


The Nasdaq still holds two days of institutional selling, while the S&P 500 maintains three distribution days over the past few weeks. That's a normal amount of distribution.


With the market pulling back from record highs, investors should be prepared to play some defense. Despite this week's losses, the Nasdaq still carries a cushion above its critical [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Stocks To Watch: Apple, Tesla
-----------------------------


Tech giants Apple and Tesla are testing their key 50-day moving averages amid Wednesday's weakness.



[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Apple lost 1.8% Wednesday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time since Nov. 24. Remember, [not every break of the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/palo-alto-vs-apple-why-not-every-break-of-support-is-a-sell-signal/) is a clear sell signal; however, Wednesday's action is clearly indicative of significant weakness.


Meanwhile, Apple shares fell as much as 6.8% from the 138.89 buy point before paring losses. Investor should cut their losses when a [stock falls more than 7%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) below the correct entry.


According to Leaderboard analysis, "Apple is below the buy point and now tests the 50-day moving average. A rebound could create a new buy area. The position was trimmed Jan. 29 after a break of the 21-day exponential moving average."


Tesla stock found much-needed support at its 50-day line Wednesday. Shares of the electric-auto leader declined as much as 4.3% before reversing 0.2% higher. Tesla now looks to rebound from the support level for the first time since a Nov. 18 breakout above a 466 cup-with-handle entry.


A strong rebound from here would put Tesla in a new buy area.

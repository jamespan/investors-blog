  Stock Market Pares Early Losses Despite Surging 10-Year Yield; Sellers Hit Nvidia Hard

The stock market turned in a resilient performance Tuesday after a stronger-than-expected September retail sales report — and upward revisions to August data — fueled an early sell-off.




September retail sales increased 0.7%, more than double the 0.3% consensus estimate. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.6%, triple the 0.2% consensus.


The strong data fueled continued fears of another interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve as well as the growing belief that interest rates could stay higher for longer.


But many argue that the bond market is doing the Fed's work for it. The 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 16-year high of 4.86% and was trading around 4.84% at 3 p.m. ET, up nearly 14 basis points.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.5% early but recovered for a loss of 0.3%. The strong close came with pretty good breadth, with advancers beating decliners on the Nasdaq by about 4 to 3.


But the Nasdaq's [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) remains a resistance level to watch. For the index to fully break out of its current downtrend, it'll need to reclaim its 50-day average and also move above last week's high of 13,714. It's not far from doing that.

Weakness in chip stocks weighed on the Nasdaq in the early going after the Commerce Department said it will tighten restrictions on sales of artificial-intelligence chips to China.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) gapped below its 50-day moving average and slumped nearly 8% in the first hour. The stock recovered well off lows but still lost nearly 5%. When Nvidia reported stellar earnings in August, the company said Chinese buyers accounted for 20% to 25% of all revenue from Nvidia's data center products, including AI chips.


The S&P 500 also pared losses, ending nearly flat, but it's been trading below its 50-day line since mid-September. It's hard to get aggressive on the long side with both indexes facing key technical hurdles. Breadth was also slightly positive on the NYSE.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher, marking its seventh gain in eight trading sessions, as the blue-chip index battles near the 34,000 level while holding just above its 200-day line. Small caps led the way, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%.


The stock market uptrend is under pressure after the Nasdaq slumped 1.2% Friday in lower volume. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq still have a low distribution-day count working in their favor, although IBD growth screens aren't exactly filled with prospects. Higher volume gave the Nasdaq a new distribution day Tuesday.


It's OK to have modest exposure to stocks at this point, but a healthy cash position still makes sense. A Santa Claus rally could still be in the cards, but major stock indexes need to show more proof. Higher-volume gains and lower-volume declines from here could do the trick.


Movers And Shakers
------------------


Stocks to watch include **Woodward** ([WWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWD)) in the aerospace and defense industry group. It flashed an early entry by moving above last week's high of 131.49. But the stock closed off highs in strong turnover. WWD's action was another reminder that it's still a challenging environment for chart breakouts. Breakouts need sustained buying demand to really work, and that's been a missing ingredient.



**Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) reversed higher for a gain of just over 2%. The stock's cup-with-handle base shows some erratic price swings, but a handle buy point of 317.50 is intact.


In the enterprise software group, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) jumped above its 50-day line in higher volume. NOW stock has been trading sideways since July, but it's still more than 7% off its high.


A few more stocks joined the breakout ranks Tuesday, including insurers **Unum Group** ([UNM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNM)) and **Chubb** ([CB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CB)). Unum is still in a buy zone after clearing a flat base with a 51.15 entry. Volume was light in Chubb, which closed just above a 216.09 handle entry.


Volume rolled into **Fair Isaac** ([FICO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FICO)) as the stock cleared a flat base with a 916.41 entry. Fair Isaac is an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/?), helped by a strong record of earnings growth and price performance.

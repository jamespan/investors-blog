Several Low-Profile, Highly Rated Stocks Moved Into Buy Zones In Quiet Session
===============================================================================

U.S. stock indexes struggled Thursday, unwilling to stray much either above or below the break-even line. After Thursday's session, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) reported results that topped views on earnings and revenue, but shares dropped 4% in after-hours trade.




 The Nasdaq inched down less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 trimmed almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4%. The day's big loser was the small-cap Russell 2000, which sank about 0.6%.


Volume slouched on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume too.


IBM's report of revenue growth on a year-ago basis was the first growth in sales in about five years. The company said cloud revenue increased 24%.


Although IBM sold off in after-hours trade, the late action isn't always indicative of the next day's trade. Watch to see how it reacts in Friday's session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP01181818-210x300.png)Despite the softness in the major indexes Thursday, action among leaders was favorable. More leaders were rising in strong volume than falling in strong volume.


The screen for the Market Pulse — which involves fundamentally strong stocks rising in volume — is now netting stocks beyond the familiar names.


While two of the well-known FANG names — **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) — advanced early Thursday in brisk volume, trade faded as the session progressed. Lower-profile leaders did better.


Biotech **Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)) jumped 6% in volume 57% above average. Corcept is [No. 1 in its group in Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-corcept-therapeutics-inc-cort.aspx) at Investors.com. The stock popped 3% Monday, crossing above a 20.87 buy point in below-average volume. On Tuesday, big volume kicked in as it rose an additional 4% in volume 141% above normal.


The Street expects Corcept to report earnings growth of 180% for 2017 and then grow earnings 110% in 2018.


Business software provider **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) bounced off its 50-day line in volume 34% above average. Alteryx advanced 5%. Irvine, Calif.-based Alteryx is a March initial public offering. The company has formed  two bases since its IPO. A breakout in July failed. A breakout in November gained 20%.


If Alteryx forms a base now, it would be second stage and of acceptable risk. The company reported a profit of 2 cents a share in Q3, which was its first profit in 15 quarters. Disciplined investors should wait until the company becomes more consistently profitable.


Other stocks either breaking out or close to breaking out stirred Thursday. Three of the stocks have a Composite Rating above 85. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 85 means the stock is rated in the top 15% among all the stocks in IBD's database. The three stocks are:


— Switzerland-based chipmaker **STMicroelectronics** ([STM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STM)), which cleared a 24.90 buy point in volume 40% above average but finished a penny under the entry. The big cap has a 93 Composite Rating.


— Security software provider **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), which popped above a 156.95 entry in volume 20% above average and has a 89 Composite Rating.


— **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)), which popped 1.2% to 76.75, climbing above a 76.61 buy point. Turnover was roughly average. Cognizant, a business software provider, carries an 86 rating.


Additional moves above buy points occurred among lesser-rated stocks, such as Brazil's **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)), bearings maker **Timken** ([TKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TKR)), and personal care items maker **Colgate-Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)).


The price movements among the second- or third-tier companies are bullish, even if the aggressive growth investor has no reason to buy outside the first tier. An uptrend that attracts all kinds of investors points to broad strength.


One factor that could help the stock market in 2018 is earnings. Many stocks are expecting to accelerate growth in 2018.


On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge will be released. The Street expects a reading of 97 for January. Estimates range from 95.3 to 99.


A week from Friday, the first take on Q4 GDP will be released. The final reading on Q3 was 3.2%.

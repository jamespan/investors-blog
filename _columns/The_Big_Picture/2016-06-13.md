Sellers were back in the stock market Monday as Wall Street continued to grapple with uncertainty across many fronts.


The session didn’t have the feel of decisive institutional selling, but volume rose on the Nasdaq, giving the tech index another distribution day and putting the market uptrend under pressure.


The Nasdaq pierced its 50-day moving average, falling 0.9%. The S&P lost 0.8% and the Dow dropped 0.7%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 1.1%. The IBD 50 lost 0.9%.


The CBOE Volatility index soared nearly 23%, bringing its two-day gain to nearly 43%. A move like that means the market could be ready to bounce, but the put/call volume ratio was a tepid 0.97 Monday. Readings over 1.15 indicate significant fear in the market, which has been seen at bottoms in the past.


![MP_061316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP_061316-192x300.jpg)The terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla., over the weekend had the market on edge, not to mention the two-day Federal Reserve meeting this week and a June 23 referendum that will decide whether Britain should leave the European Union.


The Fed’s two-day meeting starts Tuesday with a decision on interest rates due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. As of Monday’s close, the odds of a rate hike were 2%. For the late-July meeting, they’re at 18%.


Meanwhile, Wall Street is also weighing the ramifications of a possible U.K. exit from the European Union. The main concern of financial markets is that a Brexit would hurt economic growth in the U.K and spill over into other economies. The pound recently hit a three-year low against the Japanese yen and an eight-week low against the U.S. dollar.


In the U.S., the 10-year Treasury ended at 1.61% Monday, its lowest close since late 2012. For comparison, the German 10-year yield is around 0.02%. Britain’s 10-year gilt currently yields around 1.2%.


SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) rallied 0.7%. It’s up 6% since its June 2 close and vying for a fresh breakout, although its April 29 breakout didn’t work at all.


A big merger failed to stir much excitement in the tech sector after Dow component **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) announced plans to buy **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) for $26.2 billion, or $196 a share. Microsoft lost close to 3% while LinkedIn soared nearly 50% to 192.21.


Terrorism fears sparked by the Orlando shooting fueled a sell-off in airline stocks. Former leader **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) slumped 6% as it tests long-term support at its 200-day moving average.


**United Continental Holdings** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) gave up 4% each. Both stocks have been in downtrends for several months yet are still potential short candidates. With institutional buyers still seemingly hesitant to put money to work, technical breakouts in the growth space generally haven’t worked well.


A strong earnings report lifted **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) over a 117.09 buy point in late April, but the breakout never went anywhere. The stock was weak Monday after notorious short-seller Citron made negative comments about the stock. Facebook gapped below its 50-day moving average, falling 2% to 113.95.


Still, it’s important to keep track of high-quality names building bases.


One example is software name **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)). The IBD 50 component is trading tightly and holding above its 50-day moving average as it carves a flat base with a 50.02 entry.

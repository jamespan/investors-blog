title: Indexes End Flat Despite Apple's Breakout: These 3 Factors Soured The Day

Apple, Apple, Apple. Despite its impressive post-earnings gap-up and fresh breakout to new highs, the fact that the largest company trading in the U.S. financial markets could not raise three major U.S. indexes gave a clue that Wednesday's session wasn't all that satisfying for growth investors.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 4.8% to 157.14, jumped past a new 156.75 buy point in a nearly 11-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). It showed a big spike in volume as 69 million shares changed hands, nearly triple its usual amount. Yet its gain in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) wasn't enough to make a big dent in the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 or the Dow Jones industrial average.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both finished up or down less than 0.1%. The 30-stock Dow, helped by 1-point-plus gains by Apple and three other components, edged up 0.2%. Volume was sharply higher on the Nasdaq. Early data showed volume was roughly flat on the NYSE.


Heavy institutional selling has dissipated somewhat in recent weeks. The S&P 500 lost its June 27 distribution day (a significant drop, at least 0.2%, in higher volume than the prior session) on time and now just has two relevant instances of unusually heavy profit-taking.


On the Nasdaq, the distribution days remain at three, and they occurred in cluster fashion (a stalling day on July 26, a 0.6% drop on July 27, a 0.4% fall on July 31). But none of these three distribution days were severe in magnitude.


Still, small caps sold off. The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped more than 1.3%. Defensive issues led; the Dow utility average rose 0.4% amid a stalling in the rise in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continues to bow below the 2.30% level, currently at 2.27%.


Given that Apple alone makes up nearly 7% of the total market value of the Nasdaq composite, the paltry move was disappointing.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MP080217.png)One of the reasons why the market failed to go up like Apple was the poor technical showing of stocks in general. The Nasdaq advance-decline line has been rising for weeks, but not so on Wednesday. Falling issues outmatched rising ones by a nearly 5-to-2 ratio, while on the NYSE, losers beat winners by a more than 3-to-2 margin.


Another reason why: Leading stocks appeared to take the brunt of the day's selling. In the IBD 50, all but three of the top 15-ranked stocks declined, and nine of them dropped 1% or more. They included a 6% beating of **Nutrisystem** ([NTRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRI)) and a 21.7% drubbing of laser expert **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)). Of course, these and other stocks have made serious gains since the market turned higher in November, so they have a lot more to give back than the average stock.


A third reason: Some of the bases that have recently formed were riddled with flaws. And such situations usually don't end well.


Take **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)), recently highlighted in [The New America](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/macom-sees-gold-in-mining-the-silver-linings-of-data-clouds/) section. The specialist in analog semiconductors for radios, radar, navigation systems and other products got body-slammed with a 25% drop in the heaviest turnover so far in 2017. Even though Macom reported a 40% gain in fiscal third-quarter earnings to 66 cents a share, and a 37% revenue rise, the earnings missed the consensus view by 3 cents.



As a daily chart shows, Macom moved like a bucking bronco once it cleared a 52.32 handle buy point in a nearly five-month base that began in early December. And yet, after an initial failed breakout, Macom rebounded enough to post a 26% gain from that entry before Wednesday's sell-off.


In most cases, it's smart to take at least partial profits when a gain from a proper breakout point reaches 20% to 25%. And when a stock is showing excessively choppy action, take that as a clue that the institutions do not unanimously agree on the fundamentals of the company.


Nonetheless, the New America index has sharply outperformed the major indexes. You can track it in the Market Indexes table, as seen on page B6 of the latest IBD Weekly.


Through Friday, the New America index had gained 27%, vs. a 10.4% gain for the S&P 500.

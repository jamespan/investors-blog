Indexes End Virtually Flat As New Breakouts Remain Stale

If you yawned a lot during Wednesday's trading session, you are excused. On a religiously historic day, highlighted by Pope Francis' debut visit to the U.S. and the Yom Kippur holiday for Jews, the major averages traded in a ultratight range before finishing with slight losses. A September flash reading of the PMI Manufacturing Index largely met views but did not make waves.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1%; the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was off 0.2%. Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges.

  

As for the Nasdaq composite, such a quiet session was perhaps a well-needed pause after violent selling plagued Friday — a day after the Federal Reserve decided not to move on interest rates — and Tuesday. On those days, the Nasdaq dropped 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively, stamping out all the mild gains achieved since the follow-through on Sept. 8.

  

When a major index cannot hold on to its gains that arise right after a change in market trend, it's usually a bad sign. The four distribution days taking place over the prior 11 sessions certainly do not help, either.

  

The action of the past two months bespeaks of a market that is under significant selling pressure.

  

As the daily chart on Page B2 shows, the Nasdaq has clearly showed a general change in character compared with the backing-and-filling action that dominated the market from early March to the July 20 peak of 5231.

  

The 50-day moving average on the same chart is also telling. The slope of that line has been diving for more than four weeks.

  

Amid this relatively gloomy backdrop, an investor should remain highly cautious with any new buys. Trading on margin should be avoided, as rewards do not seem to match the risk. Most stocks have not been producing many gains after breaking out.

  

There are, however, a few silver linings to consider.

  

One, for the stock pickers, it's a real test of investment mettle. While the metals stocks continue to slide lower, stocks in the cruise ship, auto parts retailing, business software, Internet and e-commerce industries are still generating decent uptrends (see the "Leaders up in volume" portion of the Market Pulse for watch-list ideas).

  

Also, it's hard to find any signs of excessive optimism. Bullishness among newsletters polled by Investors Intelligence sank this week to 26%, again below the 30.2% who see a full-fledged bear market. (See graphs on Page B11.)

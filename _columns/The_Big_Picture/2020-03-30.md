Stocks Rally But A Key Signal Was Missed; Still, Some Positive Signs Emerge
============================================================================

Indexes rallied into the close Monday, after the stock market came tantalizingly close to a bottoming signal. Still, it was a productive day as the market extended its weeklong rebound.




Just like on Friday, the stock market was active in the final half-hour. But on Monday, there was no late sell-off. Instead, indexes surged to close almost at session highs.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 3.6% as the technology and health care sectors led the market. The S&P 500 added 3.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.2%. Small caps lagged but narrowed the gap with large stocks late in the day. The Russell 2000 closed 2.3% higher.


Index gains were certainly big enough for a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) bottoming signal. But lower volume Monday negated that opportunity. Still, it was a productive day for the market, which has now gone a week without a serious setback.

From its current spot, the market can afford to cede some ground and not get pushed back into the ocean. The S&P 500 is up nearly 20% from its March 23 low and the Nasdaq 17%. That rebound makes it harder for the current aspirational rally to undercut prior lows and fail.


Volatility is moderating some, which is a good sign. The price bars of the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq the past two sessions remain engulfed within Thursday's wide price bar.


Investors had reason to be pessimistic Monday. On Sunday, President Donald Trump extended measures designed to stop the spread of Covid-19 through April 30. The number of [new coronavirus cases in the U.S. continued to grow by thousands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) each day.


Stock Market Sees More Leaders Near Buy Points
----------------------------------------------


A fresh stock market uptrend will not mean much if it lacks a good number of leading stocks breaking out to new highs or getting close to new highs. In the past week, a smattering of top-rated stocks have approached [buy areas](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) also is closing in on new highs. Watch for the stock to clear resistance around 393. BMO Capital Markets [raised its price target on Netflix](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-gets-price-target-hike-covid-19-usage-spike/), citing the company's advantage while much of the world is under quarantine.


**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) is 4% from a new high and forming one of the better bases in today's market. DocuSign was added to the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Monday, and Netflix is on the watchlist. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also is working on a new base.


The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index jumped 3.8%, and some chip stocks are righting themselves. Some medical stocks are rallying on hopes for a Covid-19 treatment or vaccine. **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) rose more than 6% on FDA approval for a [five-minute Covid-19 test](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-test-abt-stock-pops-fda-authorization/). Shares met resistance at the 50-day moving average, however. **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) leapt 8% after it said its coronavirus vaccine could be ready for use early next year.


Energy was a weak sector Monday, after the price of U.S. crude oil fell below $20 a barrel for the first time since 2001. Late Monday, oil was trading at $20.32 a barrel, down 5.6%. Yet, oil and gas stocks were generally stable today. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) climbed 1%.

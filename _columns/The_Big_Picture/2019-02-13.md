In stock market news Wednesday, major stock indexes ended with modest gains, but sellers were lurking below the surface as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended in the bottom half of the day's price ranges. Meanwhile, several top-rated growth stocks sat out Wednesday's gains after a period of outperformance.




In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Cornerstone OnDemand** ([CSOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSOD)) fell sharply on earnings. **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) ended with losses of 2% more.


Stock Market News: Blue Chips Outperform
----------------------------------------


The Dow Jones industrials outperformed with a 0.5% gain. Several components rose 1% or more, including **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)), **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAB)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)). The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq inched up 0.1% after rising as much as 0.6%. The Nasdaq bumped up against its 200-day moving average but got turned away, a sign of resistance.

Nasdaq and NYSE volume came in lower than Tuesday's levels. Wednesday's session had the feel of stalling, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower volume. Stalling basically is when an index closes in the lower half of its range in higher volume. In other words, indexes can't make meaningful price progress despite higher volume. It's a subtle form of distribution.


In other stock market news, Wall Street's attention remains focused on China trade talks. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was flexible on the March 1 deadline if trade talks with China showed signs of progress. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to meet with U.S. representatives Friday. For now, the 90-day trade truce ends March 1, with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports set to be raised to 25% from 10% March 2.


Uptrend Intact
--------------


The stock market has been in confirmed uptrend since the S&P 500 followed through with conviction on Jan. 4. There's been virtually no signs of institutional selling in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite since then, making for a market uptrend with little drama.


Wednesday's session notwithstanding, growth stocks have been acting well — and that's putting it mildly. Earnings season has delivered no shortage of big breakouts from the likes of **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), among others. Volatility has taken a back seat to institutional buying.


Keep in mind it's easy to get complacent when the stock market does nothing but go up. Growth portfolios are showing a lot of green right now, but being proactive is still important. Continue to monitor signs of institutional selling in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq as well as the price action of leading growth stocks. A break of short-term support at the 10-day moving average is often a time to take at least partial profits in a winner.


There's been no shortage of growth stocks holding gains after technical breakouts. For the bulls, there's a lot to like.


Security software stock **Mimecast** ([MIME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIME)) followed through Wednesday after a powerful breakout Tuesday. Group peer **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) reports Thursday before the open. New issue **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) also reports Thursday morning. It's just below a 19.30 cup-with-handle buy point.


Strong earning from **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) after the close didn't have much effect on Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) in Wednesday's after-hours session. QQQ was mostly unchanged despite a gain of nearly 4% for Cisco shares.

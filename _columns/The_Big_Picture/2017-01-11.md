No doubt, some medical stocks got the Trump thump.


But the rest of the stock market actually did all right, a clue that institutional investors are still showing an appetite for equities.


The major indexes rallied from mild declines with less than three hours left in Wednesday's session to finish broadly higher. Volume grew on the Nasdaq, while turnover fell on the NYSE slightly. Overall, that's another sign that the mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks and pensions busily deployed more capital into stocks.


![mp011117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP011117-168x300.png)The Nasdaq composite wasn't the biggest gainer among the major indexes, as its 0.2% advance was dwarfed by the Dow Jones industrials' 0.5% advance. Five of the Dow 30 components logged gains of 1 point or more. Keep in mind that the Dow 30 is price-weighted, not market-cap-weighted.


Nevertheless, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) helped the cause for both of these stock averages. The iPhone giant registered its fifth up-day in a row and added a bit more distance from a new cup-with-handle buy point of 118.12. Shares in the largest company in U.S. equity markets (by market cap) rose 0.5% to 119.75, good for a 52-week high.


As noted in a [Stock Market Today column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-up-early-apple-stages-1st-breakout-in-more-than-1-year/) last year, Apple initially broke out of a cup with handle at 110.33 amid a long bottoming process and rallied nearly 8% before fading. But now the stock looks as good as it's been in over a year, ahead of fiscal first-quarter results, likely to come out later this month.


The S&P 500 reversed from a 0.4% intraday loss to end 0.3% higher, even though generic drug firms fell more than 4% as a group. IBD's biotech industry subgroup dropped more than 3% while drug wholesalers slid 2.5% and ethical drugs nearly 2%.


No doubt, some U.S. carmakers got a Trump thumbs-up following plans for expanding factories within the nation's borders. **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) has surged since breaking a long-term downtrend in late October and climbing out of a bottoming-style base.


Those industries that make or operate on wheels or wings generally did very well, in fact, on Wednesday. The Dow Jones transportation average gained 1% on the back of strength among airlines.


As IBD has reported earlier this week, [good operating results in December](https://www.investors.com/news/american-improves-unit-revenue-view-doj-backs-off-collusion-case/) from the likes of **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)), noted in today's Market Pulse, and  **Southwest Air** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) seem to bode well for the incoming deluge of fourth-quarter results in the next three weeks.


**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) and chipmaking heavyweight **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) both report Q4 results on Thursday. Several [bank giants report earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/what-to-expect-when-jpmorgan-bofa-and-wells-fargo-report-earnings/) on Friday. (See the list of earnings dates on Page B2 each week in the IBD Weekly print edition.)

Given the large expectations for President-elect [Donald Trump's news conference Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stocks-wipe-away-losses-close-higher-drug-stocks-feel-trump-thump/), one might have expected more volatility.


Instead, the opposite occurred. As noted above, the S&P 500's positive reversal was welcome news for the bulls, yet it wasn't that extreme. Ditto for the Nasdaq composite, which notched a fourth straight all-time closing high.


Certainly, the news focus was on Trump's continued ranting over high drug prices and costs of military jets. None of this was new. Perhaps that's why the market technicals did not give off many negative vibes.


While winners beat losers by a narrow 5-to-4 margin on the Nasdaq, winners trounced losers 2-to-1 on the NYSE.


As seen in Tuesday's General Market Indicators page (see the link at the bottom of this article), the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings for both the 500 and the Nasdaq are now in positive territory with a B or B+. This doesn't have to be the case when a market uptrend has just started, but it's desirable when you are in the hunt for great stocks to buy.


Go to a [daily or weekly chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com or [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF2), and you'll see that Alaska Air has done well since clearing an 83.36 buy point within a long double-bottom base. The stock jumped from support at the 10-week moving average, though it's extended from that entry now. Shares also cleared a tight, narrow consolidation that has shown up across a bevy stocks as seen in the Stock Spotlight screen.


These are not proper patterns. But an aggressive investor with strong conviction may add to a winning position when a stock rallies above these narrow three- to four-week price consolidations — what IBD founder Bill O'Neil likes to call "tight areas."

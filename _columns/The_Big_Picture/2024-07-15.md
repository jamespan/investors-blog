  Russell 2000 Leads Another Decent Advance; These Growth Stocks Jump On Potential Trump Presidential Win

Growth stocks showed an increasingly bullish streak on Monday, after a weekend assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump failed to shake Wall Street. Small caps led the way.




And curiously, the unusual fortitude seen by certain sectors hinted that Trump — fortunate to have escaped the stage during a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania with a minor injury to his ear — has a higher likelihood of winning the White House.


Small Caps Lead
---------------


The Russell 2000 paced Monday's advance. A 1.8% jump comes atop a breathtaking 6% leap during last week's action. At 2,187, the Russell 2000 has still not caught up with its fellow equity averages in terms of year-to-date gains. However, the index now has reached its highest level since the week ended Jan. 14, 2022.


That month was truly significant. The stock market and growth stocks began to roll over amid fears that the Federal Reserve would go on an aggressive campaign of tightening the money supply in a bid to curb wild inflation seen in the prior year. In 2022, the Russell 2000 sank 21.6%, while the S&P 500 surrendered 19.4% excluding dividends.


Going back to Monday's session, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund added nearly 0.6%, good for a fourth straight advance. At the day's high of 559.05, the ETF briefly topped its year-to-date high. It now has risen 9.5% for the year, slightly more than the Russell's 7.9% boost.


Large caps continued to dominate the performance in the first 6-1/2 months of 2024. Yet on Monday, the S&P 500 sat in the back seat of the rally, up 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite also trailed the small caps, rising 0.4%. Three of the [Magnificent Seven megacap growth stocks fell](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) on Monday, down 0.5% to 0.9% each.


The S&P 500 is now up 18% since Jan. 1, the Nasdaq up 23%.


Volume eased mildly on the NYSE, down 2% vs. Friday's session to 3.62 billion shares. On the Nasdaq, turnover cooled nearly 7% to 5.45 billion.

Will These Growth Stocks Thrive?
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP071524-230x300.jpg)Breadth in the stock market continued to improve. This fact benefits all IBD-style investors in growth stocks. According to preliminary data, winners surpassed losers on the New York Stock Exchange by a healthy 4-3 margin. On the Nasdaq issues, more than 800 stocks rose vs. fell, according to ThinkorSwim.


(Be sure to check the final breadth numbers by going to the [General Market Indicators chart page](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI_071524.pdf), using a link at the bottom of every Big Picture.)


So, it's no surprise that the S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF, while finishing just 0.1% higher on Monday, has gotten awfully close to eclipsing its year-to-date peak of 169.80 set on March 28.


Nonetheless, IBD's analysis of industry groups pointed to gobs of dollars heading toward the highest-quality growth stocks in the energy sector. Why? Perhaps a Trump win in November would lead to a loosening of current regulations on the domestic oil and gas market.


West Texas intermediate crude oil futures edged 0.3% lower to $81.98 a barrel. But that did not stop **TechnipFMC** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)) from soaring out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a 27.30 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). Shares rose 6% to 28.28 on Monday, so the stock remains in the 5% buy zone to 28.67.


Volume in TechnipFMC ripped 90% higher than average. That's exactly what you'd like to see during a powerful breakout by growth stocks. Technip also chalked up its third heaviest turnover in an up session since April.


Growth stocks that show huge volume on the [breakout day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or soon afterward stand the best chance of reaping strong gains over a short time frame, IBD has found in research on the best companies over the past decades. Volume that comes in significantly above a stock's 50-day average level confirms serious institutional buying. (Use the red line drawn across the volume bars on an [IBD daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-index-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily) or on [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) to spot unusual changes in turnover. The red line represents the 50-day moving average.)

Steady Growth At TechnipFMC
---------------------------


The company specializes in land-based and offshore equipment to develop oil and gas assets. In the first quarter, TechnipFMC posted a profit of 22 cents a share vs. a penny in the year-ago period. Sales grew 19% to $2.04 billion. Those results stretched the U.K.-based company's record of double-digit top-line growth to seven straight quarters. Over that time frame, growth averaged a solid 15.3%.



Notice on a weekly chart how TechnipFMC formed its nine-week pattern without suffering a single down week in above-average volume. That's another key element of using charts to spot the best growth stocks.


In the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), fund managers also concentrated their new buys in fields such as banking, trucking, security and mining and construction machinery.


Some market pundits expressed optimism over EV makers, as a Trump win may lead to even tougher tariffs, or at least the extension of current ones, on Chinese electric vehicle imports.

Does A Trump Win Matter For Gold Shares?
----------------------------------------


Meanwhile, could gold miners emerge as new leaders among growth stocks? Gold itself is eyeing a fourth straight weekly advance. Four more years of Trump or four years of Biden actually might not matter when it comes to government spending. With budget deficits still large and the overall debt burden growing, some investors may perceive gold and silver assets as a safe haven.



Names to watch in the gold and mining group include **Alamos Gold** ([AGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGI)), **Pan American Silver** ([PAAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAAS)), **Anglo Gold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) and Peru-based **Compania de Minas** ([BVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BVN)). Pan American Silver, a big winner in the prior two weeks, fell 2% to 23.21. The midcap miner is [holding in the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) from a 22.75 buy point.


Alamos Gold is hovering right above a [cup-without-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) of 17.29. [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-buy-zone-is-the-sweet-spot/) goes from 17.29 to 18.15. Wall Street thinks the Toronto-based developer of gold mines in Mexico and Turkey will post a 44% jump in earnings this year to 76 cents a share and a 23% boost in 2025.


Meanwhile, the business media also pointed to Bitcoin-related growth stocks as another area that could do very well, particularly if the upcoming November elections generate more uncertainty over which parties will control the White House and Congress.


More Growth Stocks To Watch
---------------------------



**Coinbase** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)), a platform for trading cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum, spurted 11% to 242.85. Volume increased 73% vs. its 50-day moving average.


The stock recently peaked at 283.48 and has been building a [new base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) [A potential trendline entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) may unfold near 253 on a daily chart.


The CoinDesk bitcoin price rose 5.9% to $63,453 and went up 10.6% over a four-day winning streak, according to Dow Jones Data. The rally marked the best four-day stretch since a four-day 12.1% advance that ended May 5.


San Francisco-based Coinbase grew first-quarter sales 112% vs. a year earlier to $1.64 billion, a quarterly record. That muscular top-line increase helped feed huge earnings of $4.40 a share vs. a net loss of 34 cents in Q1 of 2023.


[According to MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF), analysts on consensus see Q2 profit of 94 cents (vs. a net loss of 42 cents a year ago) and sales growing 95% to $1.38 billion. Expect Q2 results from Coinbase on Aug. 6.


The number of mutual funds owning a piece of COIN has bulged from 884 in Q3 of last year to 1,257 at the end of June this year.


In other financial markets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield edged up four basis points to 4.22%. It's still down sharply from an April near-term peak of 4.73%.

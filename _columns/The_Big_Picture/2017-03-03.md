=======================================================================

U.S. stocks didn't make much progress Friday, unable to parse anything new from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech in Chicago.


The Nasdaq advanced less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were positive but nearly flat. The small-cap S&P 600 dropped 0.3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MP030317-242x300.png)Yellen's remarks suggested an interest rate hike in March is likely. The Fed will have its two-day meeting March 14-15. CME Group's Fed Watch Tool estimates the odds for a rate hike this month at 79.7%.


The market has posted small gains the past two weeks. The mood seems to have shifted to nonchalance. While that doesn't lead to aggressive moves up, nonchalance provides the ability to shrug off bad news.


For example, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) rebounded almost 1% after Thursday's 4% loss on news it was under federal investigation. On Friday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the raids at Caterpillar were tied to "inbound goods that shouldn't be."


While a less confident stock market might have reacted more severely to this development, especially because of President Trump's protectionist bent, some analysts say the Caterpillar probe is linked to an ongoing tax dispute involving $2 billion in taxes and penalties.


If so, then the raids don't represent anything new.


The bullish action in strong sectors also doesn't represent anything new, but that could be a good thing. Individual investors who have committed money to the strong sectors see their decision confirmed.


According to preliminary data, the top-performing industry groups for the week encompassed groups Trump appears friendly toward as well as groups he has frowned on.


Biotechs and their drug prices have been on Trump's bad list, but the group rose 5.7% for the week to lead 197 industry groups. Biotechs rose after Trump in Tuesday's speech [voiced support for drug innovation and speedy approvals](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotechs-leap-on-trumps-calls-for-innovation-speedy-fda-approval/).


Other leaders for the week included travel bookers, up 5.4%; and the Trump infrastructure favorite, cement, up 4.5%.


In the top 15 for the week, the building sector grabbed five spots, including the homebuilders. Highly rated groups such as steel and super-regional banks were also top performers.


Retail and gold miners were the week's worst performers.


For the week, the Nasdaq rose 0.4%; the S&P 500, 0.7%; and the Dow, 0.9%.

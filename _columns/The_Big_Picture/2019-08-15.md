Stock Market Bulls Get Last Word With Positive Reversal
========================================================

Small losses carried into Thursday afternoon trade almost seemed like a win for the stock-market bulls, and by the end of the session they mostly became a win. In the meantime, an unexpectedly strong quarterly report from **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) suggested recession fears are overblown.




The stock market reversed positively Thursday, and the indexes closed high in the day's range.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The Nasdaq slipped 0.1% after closing well off session lows. Small caps as gauged in the Russell 2000 fell 0.4%.


Volume in the stock market was lower on both major exchanges.

In the Dow Jones index, Walmart's 6% gain along with a 2.4% gain from **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and a 1.6% pop from **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) countered the almost 9% loss of **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)).


Gap-Up Moves
------------


The session also featured some gap-up moves, which is about as bullish as it gets for an individual stock. Yet, many of the gap ups reversed off the high, turning the bullish signal into a conflicted message.


Scientific instruments maker **Agilent Technologies** ([A](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=A)) gapped up about 11% in the first 15 minutes of trade and then retreated to a 6% gain for the day.


China's online retailer **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) gapped up 5.5% at the open and then sank to a 2.9% gain. The stock was volatile after its [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alibaba-earnings-q1-2020-alibaba-stock/).


Walmart did better, turning a 7% gap up in the first five minutes of trade into a 6% gain at the close.



Walmart's quarterly report was a relief to stock-market bulls. [Earnings beat the consensus view](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-q2-2019-walmart-stock-dow-jones/) by 4%. Revenue came in slightly higher than expected. Same-store sales rose 2.8%, above views for 2.1%.


For bears expecting a U.S. recession, the Walmart report said not so fast. On Thursday, the company also raised its outlook for the full year.


While Walmart is not a growth stock, it can serve as a useful gauge for consumer spending.


Stocks hitting new highs Thursday included baking soda maker **Church & Dwight** ([CHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHD)), which is close to a possible breakout in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/). The buy point is 79.32. The stock swung 1.7% higher.


**Dunkin' Brands** ([DNKN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNKN)) scored a new high, as it rose 1.9%. The midcap [stock is near an 83.32 buy point](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dunkin-brands-stock-buy-point/). The restaurant group is fairly strong right now. Going into Thursday's session, restaurants rated No. 34 among 197 industry groups.


Other strong plays in the restaurant group include **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) and **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)).


When and if a stock breaks out, it's helpful to have winners in its industry group.


Numbers For Stock-Market Bulls
------------------------------


Stock-market bulls found some ammunition to bolster their case in economic reports.


[Retail sales in the U.S. for July](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-economic-growth/) rolled in 0.7% higher vs. the consensus view for 0.3%. The 0.7% reading was higher than any estimate in the entire range.


The Philadelphia Fed's business survey came in at 16.8, shooting above all estimates. The consensus target was 11.1. The Empire State manufacturing gauge for August was 4.8, well above views for 2.5.


Also, [the put/call ratio closed at 1.24](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-bears-lose-put-call-bottom/) Wednesday — well above the minimum 1.15 level that can identify a near-term market bottom.

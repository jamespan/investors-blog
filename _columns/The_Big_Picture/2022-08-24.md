Stock Market Mildly Halts 3-Day Slide; 5 Matters To Mind Ahead Of Friday's Powell Speech
=========================================================================================

Wednesday's action ended a three-day slide in the stock market. Yet investors appear to embrace a holding pattern ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell on monetary policy slated for Friday.




A 0.4% gain by the Nasdaq did little to erase the damage over the past week. Since the Aug. 16 near-term peak of 13,181, the composite index has lost as much as 6.3%.


As some panelists on the [daily IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) frequently say, when a major index such as the Nasdaq swims in between its 50-day and 200-day moving average, it's in "no man's land."


Further complicating the picture? The Nasdaq's 50-day moving average has been bending upward since July 21 — nearly a month after the June 24 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Yet the same index's 200-day moving average continues to slope lower.


The S&P 500 also halted a three-session losing streak with its 0.3% rebound on Wednesday. However, the large-cap benchmark more or less is mirroring the Nasdaq's picture.


Small caps outperformed. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gained 0.8% in dwindling turnover. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF rose 0.5%.



[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/) showed MDY's volume fell 57% below its 50-day moving average. This isn't just bone-dry volume. It's more like the Atacama Desert in Chile, reportedly the driest place on Earth.

How A Stock Market Acts In August
---------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP082422-216x300.jpg)Institutions continued to sell long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose 5 basis points to 3.10%. That marked the highest close since June 28. The sell-off in Treasuries followed mixed data on U.S. durable goods orders.


West Texas Intermediate oil futures jumped 1.7% to $95.37 a barrel. Oil is trying to recover from its bear market beatdown, having fallen 35% from a peak of $130.50 a barrel.


Now, the summer doldrums really do take effect in the final two weeks of August. Many portfolio managers take vacation. Volume in recent days has drifted to the lowest levels of the year. Typically, action accelerates right after the Labor Day holiday weekend.


Yet Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City opens its annual three-day retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for the world's central bank chiefs. The scenic Grand Tetons that have made Jackson Hole famous also give a quiet reminder of the jagged movement in stocks so far in 2022.


Some veteran portfolio managers see the U.S. central bank making a third straight hike of 75 basis points to boost the fed funds rate to a target range of 3% to 3.25%, then wait and watch the economy as the country shifts focus on the November midterm elections. Others do not expect Powell to announce any dramatic shift in the bank's intention to steer inflation back to a long-term annual target of 2%.


On Wednesday, the probability of a 75-basis-point hike grew to 62.5%, up from 40.3% a month ago. The chance of a 50-basis point rise has fallen to 37.5%.

5 Things To Watch
-----------------


IBD readers may want to not only judge the state of the stock market simply by seeing how their own holdings fare. Consider these five additional factors:


One: Can the moving averages in key indexes move in tandem and upward? Blue chips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up a measly 0.2% on Wednesday, are pretty much imitating what's been seen elsewhere. The shorter-term 10-day moving average and 21-day exponential moving average have climbed sharply since July, and they have both risen well above the 50-day line. Nice. But the Dow has failed to stay above its 200-day moving average for longer than a day or two since the spring.


Two: Will leadership broaden out beyond energy? On Wednesday, 15 IBD industry groups gained 2% or more. Database software and homebuilding stood out within this pack. A far majority came from oil and gas. Yet specialty retail, logistics, specialty steel and alloy, and biotech stocks rose 1.5% or more as a group.


Watch The Leaders
-----------------


Three: Can new breakout stocks generate cheery gains? The Market Pulse shows growth stocks such as **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)), **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) and **Golar LNG** ([GLNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLNG)) are doing pretty well after clearing buy points (58.44, 102.08 and 27.62, respectively).


Four: Will market internals get healthier? The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has dipped since last week. Yet this signature of stock market breadth has climbed steadily from its June low. The NYSE A-D line weaves a similar yarn. Meanwhile, it's interesting to see that despite indexes' losses on Tuesday, upside volume dwarfed downside turnover on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. You can track this on the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of every Big Picture.

Five: Can companies continue to beat profit expectations? Yardeni Research notes forward earnings are rising for energy, real estate and utility firms within the S&P 500. Yet, they've stalled in recent weeks in the consumer staples, financial and industrial sectors. "If on balance S&P 500 forward earnings goes sideways and the index's forward P/E goes sideways, as we expect, so goes the S&P 500 stock price index until earnings start moving higher next year," Yardeni wrote in a note sent to IBD. "That should make a good market for stock pickers."


Beyond Stock Market Today: Future Of Shareholder Returns
--------------------------------------------------------


Research at mutual fund giant Janus Henderson has found that [U.S. dividends hit an all-time high in the second quarter](https://www.investors.com/research/warren-buffett-stock-boosts-payout-as-us-dividend-growth-shows-remarkable-resilience/).


A whopping 94% of companies within the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index boosted or maintained their cash payouts to shareholders over this period, to a total $144.4 billion, with two-fifths of the increase in dividend payments hailing from financial companies.


"Dividends continue to capture investor attention as uncertainty surrounding the economy's plight has increased demand for companies with strong free cash flow," Matt Peron, research director at Janus Henderson, said in a news release. "As we move toward 2023, any slowdown in economic growth will likely have a larger impact on dividend payments outside the U.S. Inside the U.S., dividend growth has shown remarkable resilience across market cycles, as companies have demonstrated they are more likely to cut back on share buybacks than trim dividend payments."

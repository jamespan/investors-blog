Not all up days in the stock market should be treated equally. And Tuesday's session perhaps could go into the folder named "less than ideal."




The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished higher in the range of 0.4% to 0.5%. But the major equity indexes squandered tastier gains of the 1.3% to 1.4% variety following a downdraft of afternoon selling that intensified just before the final hour of the regular session.


At 11,516, the Nasdaq finished well in the lower half of Tuesday's range. That left the tech-heavy index almost 5% below its all-time high of 12,074.


[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) notes that the premier index for growth companies showed a dismal closing range of 28%.


![MP102020](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MP102020-185x300.jpg)Volume edged 1% higher on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


Meanwhile, investors unloaded long-dated U.S. Treasuries heavily. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond jumped for a fourth straight day, reaching 0.81%. The 30-year bonds now yield 1.60%, up from 1.45% at the start of October.


These Markets Outperformed Stocks
---------------------------------


Commodities rallied more firmly than U.S. stocks as well.


U.S. crude oil futures jumped 1.5% to $41.46 a barrel. Copper, a good barometer of the manufacturing side of the economy, surged 1.9% to $3.14 a pound. That marks the highest level since June 2018.


The Nasdaq showed [an inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/). But after Monday's disappointing reversal and 1.7% drubbing, one would have preferred the Nasdaq to stage a bullish [outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/) in which it recouped all of the prior session's losses and more.


Small caps posted an even lousier advance.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) mustered only a 0.2% rebound after losing nearly 1.5% in the prior two trading days. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) edged up 0.5%, yet the ETF still holds a solid 4.3% gain since Oct. 1.


Handles Galore
--------------


For now, however, growth stocks generally are performing well. A "quiet" up day actually allows true market leaders to further shape bullish chart patterns, including the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


[On the IBD Live show Tuesday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), panelists gave their take on highly rated companies etching new handles on their bases. They include **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Teladoc** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)).


[A handle must develop for at least five trading sessions](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), especially on a daily chart. The action represents a final shakeout of uncommitted holders as their shares move into sturdier hands on Wall Street. A one-week handle on a weekly chart is acceptable, too.


But the [CAN SLIM investor](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) must be choosy.



As **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) demonstrated recently, not all breakouts are bearing sweet fruit.


Netflix fell 1% ahead of its [Wall Street-estimate-whiffing Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-earnings-q3-2020-nflx-stock/) — then dropped an additional 5% after hours on third-quarter results. But another member of the FAANG gang actually brushed off an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department on Tuesday. Google owner **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), up 1.4%, held bullishly above its 50-day moving average. It's forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Two More Nasdaq Stocks
----------------------


Also in the Nasdaq, [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) [slashed its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since it galloped out of a four-month cup-type base at 39.20 on May 6. As a result, its position size on Leaderboard got reduced. Character change? Quite possibly, yes. Watch to see if mutual funds, banks, pension plans and other large investors shore up the stock. Mutual fund ownership has grown sharply over the past year.



Meanwhile, **Netgear** ([NTGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTGR)) also got covered in Tuesday's IBD Live as shares in the wireless internet gear giant cleared a 35.03 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a seven-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/). [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) goes up to 36.78. Volume jumped nearly four times its 50-day average of 255,000 shares.


The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) powered to multimonth highs, earning a [MarketSmith Blue Dot alert](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/).


Netgear reports Q3 results on Wednesday after the close, which is a risk for any new shareholders.


Be mindful of a stock's liquidity. Prior to Tuesday's big move, Netgear showed an average turnover of less than $9 million per day. One key portfolio management rule for individual investors: Avoid building positions that exceed 3% to 5% of the stock's average daily dollar volume.

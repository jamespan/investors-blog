Bulls found solace in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday, as other indexes trailed with meager gains.




Indexes erased early losses as the Dow Jones advanced 0.4%, while the [large cap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/big-cap-stocks-can-be-winners/) S&P 500 added 0.2%. The Nasdaq was barely above flat and the small-cap Russell 2000 trimmed 0.1%.


Volume in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq, according to early data. Thursday was an options expiration day, which often boosts volume.


Thursday also ended the U.S. trading week because of the Good Friday holiday.


Picture Is Mixed
----------------


The week sketched a mixed picture in many respects. Market-leading software stocks struggled, but another market leader, chip stocks, advanced.

But those sort of discrepancies don't tell the whole story. Action within the groups also was mixed.


For example, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) rose for a fourth straight week along with the money center banks group. But **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fell 1% Thursday, assuring a negative performance for the week. In the meantime, bears clobbered **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)), which plunged 8% for the week after it missed profit views.


Chip stocks had a stunning winner in **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), which rocketed 40% for the week. News that Qualcomm came out on top in its patent fight with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) ignited the stock.



Yet, Apple still managed a 2.5% gain for the week.


What is this mixed picture telling investors?


What's Happening?
-----------------


Sector rotation is one possibility. In the five sessions from April 12 through Thursday, solid winners included homebuilders, railroads, oil explorers, chips, retail and money centers.


Losers included software, medical groups and defensive plays such as food and tobacco.


A second possibility is that losers over the past five sessions point more to profit-taking than to aggressive sector rotation.


If that's the case, then some of the recent selling will be short-lived.


IBD-style investors who have a sizable profit cushion in their stocks are in a good position. They can book some profits, and they can take their time before buying other stocks.


Selectivity is the key.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in with the lowest reading in 50 years. The 192,000 reading was well below the consensus estimate for 206,000.


The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook gauge for April came in at 8.5, missing expectations for 10.2.


Retail sales for March doubled the expected number. The Street pegged its estimate at 0.8%, but sales doubled that with a 1.6% pop.

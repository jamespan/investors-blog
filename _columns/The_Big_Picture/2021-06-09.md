  Stock Market Eases As Sluggish Trend Continues; All Eyes On This Inflation Report

The stock market continued a dull trend Wednesday, as the main indexes went from modest gains to mild losses. With a key [inflation report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) Thursday, perhaps it was normally cautious behavior.




In the end, Wednesday's charts appeared to reflect some reluctant buyers.


The Nasdaq composite was up nearly 0.6% in early trading, but faded through much of the day. It closed 0.1% lower. The composite has been rebounding since it found support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) last week, so its overall trajectory remains satisfactory.


The S&P 500 looks flatter. The index eased almost 0.2% Wednesday, making it the third straight day of 0.2% or smaller moves. Through it all, the S&P 500 remains less than 1% from record highs. The combination of slow progress and near record highs makes for a tempting opportunity to take profits. But it also shows the stock market is not ceding ground.

While small caps had escaped the stock market inertia, that was not the case Wednesday. The Russell 2000 lost 0.7%. It is still up nearly 2% for the week, though.


Stock Market Rotation
---------------------


During this year's stock market, leadership has rotated often. This month, the best-performing industry groups include document management, education software, property REITs, jewelry, fiber optics and several oil-related groups. The weaker groups include travel booking, airlines, medical services, trucking, homebuilders, airfreight and generic drugs.


In airfreight, **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) sold off more than 4% Wednesday after it gave a weak outlook on margins in the U.S. side of business. **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) fell in sympathy.


One technical aspect improved. The May 4 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 is now dropped due to time. Distribution days have a shelf life of 25 sessions. The S&P 500 still has a weighty five distribution days, but the Nasdaq has slimmed down to just two. (Wednesday's losses were too mild to be regarded as distribution.)


The IBD 50 fell less than 0.2%. The index also has been flattish the past couple of weeks, but the leading stocks are largely in good shape.



**Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) again jumped from support at the 50-day moving average. **360 DigitTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)) followed through on a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is near a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Many more are forming [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) or follow-on patterns that could see big gains if the stock market breaks out of its funk.


Transportation, financials, industrials and materials were the weakest S&P sectors. But the Utility Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) rose 0.9% and Healthcare Select Sector SPDR ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) tacked on 1%.


Investors Watching Inflation Report Thursday Morning
----------------------------------------------------


There's a defensive tone to these sectors, and it may reflect some apprehension in the stock market about inflation. Alarming price readings the past few months threaten to force the Federal Reserve to reverse its stimulus strategy, although the Fed has said it will be patient in keeping interest rates near zero.



Inflation news headlines come Thursday before the open with the [May consumer price index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Economists expect an increase of 0.4% from April and 4.6% from a year ago. Excluding food and fuel costs, the consensus estimate is for a 0.4% rise from April and 3.4% from a year earlier.


The bond market, for one, is not expecting more inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell below 1.5%. Late Wednesday, the yield was quoted at 1.49%, down 4 basis points.


"Tomorrow's inflation data won't change the Fed's mind over inflation, but a hot reading could help put a tentative floor on Treasury yields," Edward Moya, senior market analyst at currency trading firm Oanda, said in a report. "The 10-year Treasury yield is . . . extending declines after investors showed robust demand for the 10-year Treasury auction."

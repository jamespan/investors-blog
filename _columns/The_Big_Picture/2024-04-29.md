  Stock Market Adds To Rebound But Indexes Now Face A Critical Test

The major indexes followed up last week's solid rebound with moderate gains Monday — a decent start for a week in which the stock market faces multiple tests.




The Nasdaq composite climbed nearly 0.4% while the S&P 500 added 0.3%.


Both indexes have come up to tests of their 50-day moving averages, a line poised to become an important chart signal this week. A move back above it would bode well for the market. But if indexes meet resistance and roll over, a new leg down in the market is quite possible.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.7% increase.


The IBD 50 index, however, fell 0.4% as **Kaspi.kz** ([KSPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSPI)), **GigaCloud Technology** ([GCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GCT)), **CleanSpark** ([CLSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLSK)) and **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) weighed.


Volume fell on the New York Stock Exchange but rose on the Nasdaq. Breadth was positive, with advancers over decliners by a 3-to-2 ratio on the NYSE and by about 12-to-7 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet. Still, two stocks accounted for much of Monday's index gains.


Apple, Tesla Aid Stock Market Gains
-----------------------------------


**![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP042924.jpg)Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — which alone represents more than 8% of the Nasdaq and nearly 6% of the S&P 500 — rallied 2.5%. The stock climbed back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) after a Bernstein analyst [upgraded the stock to outperform](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-fiscal-q2-earnings-preview/) from market perform.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which is 1.7% of the Nasdaq and little more than 1% of the S&P 500, vaulted 15.3%. In fact, Tesla was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Monday, by far.


The company [won tentative approval for Full Self-Driving technology](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-soars-china-fsd-approval-cathie-wood-bullish-ai/) in China after Chief Executive Elon Musk made a surprise visit to the country over the weekend.


Certainly, other major techs didn't help the stock market. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) slid 3.4%, while **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) lost 1%.


Although indexes started fading around 2 p.m. ET, selling picked up at 3 p.m. ET, just as the Treasury Dept. announced it [will need to borrow $41 billion more](https://www.barrons.com/articles/treasury-refunding-announcement-461e3c8b?mod=hp_DAY_3) in the current quarter than initially expected.


The bond market had a muted response, however. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 4.61%, with most of the drop occurring before the Treasury's announcement.


Stock indexes bounced into the close.


Stock Market Exposure Level Higher
----------------------------------


On Friday, Investor's Business Daily raised its recommended exposure level to 20%-40%. The Nasdaq's 2% rally fell just short of a follow-through rally confirmation due to slightly lower volume.


Yet, the encouraging action in the main indexes and many leading stocks was sufficient to recommend that investors poke their heads out of bomb shelters.


Making some limited buys — **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)), [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/carrier-global-carr-stock-buy-point-ai-heatwave/) **Carrier** ([CARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARR)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) come to mind — is one way to raise exposure.


An indecisive market, however, also means investors cannot be forgiving and must be ready to dump new buys at the first sell signal.


The stock market still needs a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) to get the rally attempt to become a more-convincing uptrend. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq so far are obliging, each still climbing from their April 19 lows.


Indexes have closed near session highs most of the six sessions, including Thursday's decline. That's the opposite action seen in the market's mid-April slump, and it indicates that buyers are gaining the upper hand.


What The Market Is Watching This Week
-------------------------------------


On Wednesday, the Fed concludes its policy meeting, which will bring new indications on the future path of interest rates. With inflation showing itself to be sticky this year, Fed officials have been walking back expectations of rate cuts. So Wednesday's policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell's comments loom large.


Investors already have pared expectations, with realistic odds of the first rate cut not appearing until the September Fed meeting.


Apple, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) are some of the [reports this week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) that could have spillover effects on the stock market.


And on Friday, the Labor Department releases its April employment report.

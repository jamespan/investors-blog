Nasdaq Keeps Climbing Steadily; S&P 500 Down For Week
======================================================

Stock indexes put in a routine day Friday despite bad news on second-quarter GDP.


The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and IBD 50 added almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. Volume rose across the board.


Q2's gross domestic product came in at 1.2%, below the consensus estimate of 2.6% and below the lowest figure in the Street's range. Worse yet, GDP was revised lower for the previous two quarters.


Perhaps part of the reason for the nonchalance in the stock market was tied to two factors.


First, for those who fear interest-rate hikes, Friday was a reassuring day. The weak GDP number made it less likely that the Federal Reserve will act in September at its next meeting.

Revisions like that may have convinced the market that the problem isn't just the economy. The problem is that the government economists and their favorite gauges are too erratic. How is the Street to have confidence in Friday's GDP figure? Yes, investors can wait a month, and on Aug. 26 the second reading will be out. Yet, how trustworthy will that figure be?


Fortunately, individual investors have a much better gauge available to them than government-cooked data: the stock market itself.


The message from the Street on Friday: Don't worry, but also don't be too happy. In the past 15 sessions, the Nasdaq has recorded only one daily gain of 1% or more, while the S&P 500 has had none. A 0.4% loss has been the sharpest daily drop in the same period for either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500.


The two major indexes have been going in different paths since they both cleared prior resistance levels. The S&P 500 has a sideways look over the past three weeks. If it were a stock, it would fit the definition of a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, keeps climbing and is leading the market. Stock gains sparked by strong results from big Nasdaq components such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) have aided the Nasdaq's advance.


For the week, the Nasdaq advanced 1.2%, and the IBD 50, 1.1%. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%.


For top-rated stocks, Friday was typical of this rally. Leaders continued to push to new highs.


Coming Up: The big item on the calendar in the coming week is Friday's unemployment and payroll report for July. Earnings seasonÂ will continue with **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) reporting Wednesday.

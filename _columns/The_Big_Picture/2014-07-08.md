Stocks Keep Sliding; Market Under Pressure

The stock market continued fraying Tuesday, signaling that it's time for a defensive shift in investment strategy.

  

For a second straight day, the main indexes sustained sharp losses in higher volume. They gave the market back-to-back distribution days.

  

With five distribution days on the S&P 500 and four on the Nasdaq, it's become evident that institutional investors are backing away from stocks.

  

Many leading stocks have quickly come under duress. Sell signals, which had been sparse in recent weeks, are surfacing for many.

  

It has been a rapid deterioration for a market uptrend that up to this week had seen little distribution or reason to worry much about the leading stocks. Clearly, the market is now under pressure, and individual investors should start backing away from stocks.

  

The Nasdaq slid 1.3% as solar power, software and biotech stocks became some of the worst performers of the day. Already, it's the fourth-worst week of the year for the composite.

  

The S&P 500 fell 0.7%; it is controlling its losses better.

  

The IBD 50 skidded 1.9%, which wasn't surprising after seeing how badly some leaders fared.

  

Despite the market's steady uptrend and the plenty of breakouts that followed the May 27 follow-through, few top-rated stocks made sizable advances from their buy points. They put growth investors in a jam because in most cases, the investors have little profit cushion on their holdings. Some gains are now entirely wiped away.

  

It's smart to sell any stock before all profits are gone, and that's especially true now that the market is under pressure. Even with those stocks in which there is a small profit, investors should consider taking a minimal profit.

  

With stocks already below their entries, remember that in a flagging market it makes sense to cut losses shorter than normal, before the 8% sell rule triggers.

  

Although conditions are not bad enough to require total abstinence from stocks, any new stock purchase should be reserved for exceptional stocks making unquestionable breakouts.

  

Adding shares to current holdings is also a bad tactic. A weak market doesn't inspire confidence in follow-on chart setups.

  

There are plenty of examples of leading stocks that have retraced substantial gains from buy points, while some are below entries: **United Insurance** ([UIHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UIHC)), **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)) and **Air Lease** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)), for instance.

  

Earnings season, which begins this week, tends to make Wall Street nervous. In fact, three months ago the market tumbled as Q1 earnings reports started coming in. But the first major report was fine, as **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) beat views, and its shares rose after the close.

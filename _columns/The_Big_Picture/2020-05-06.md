Stocks Fade Late Again, As Technology, Consumer Sectors Lead Mixed Session
===========================================================================

For the second straight day, the stock market limped into the close, although technology, consumer and growth stocks separated themselves with a solid performance.




Wednesday's market was choppy, as the S&P 500 reversed lower to close with a 0.7% decline. Much of the loss came in the final half-hour of trading. Prior to that, indexes seemed content to make moderate gains. The Nasdaq, up as much as 1.4%, settled 0.5% higher.


Volume fell on both main exchanges.


The action mirrored Tuesday's, when indexes suddenly faded in the last 45 minutes but still closed higher. While it's disappointing to watch sellers take control, the stock market isn't exactly rolling over. Rather, it has some issues to work through.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain below trend lines they broke last week. The Nasdaq has tried to get back above that trend line (traced from the March 23 low), while the S&P is farther away from it. These indexes still face other important tests. The S&P 500 is about 150 points away from 3000, and the Nasdaq is about 140 points from touching 9000.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP1x1050620-248x300.jpg)Those big round numbers can bring out sellers, and the Nasdaq met resistance around 9000 in early March.


The Nasdaq appeared to stall Wednesday, but not to the point of becoming a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Traders on [IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) have been watching the 21-day exponential moving average on the indexes, and both are holding above that short-term indicator.


Also important, the number of distribution days is still negligible. And leading stocks generally are holding up.


Growth won over value: iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) climbed 0.1% while iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) fell 1.7%.


With solar, software and semiconductor stocks leading Wednesday, the Nasdaq outperformed. The enterprise software industry group climbed more than 3%. The broader iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) rose 1.2%.


A few breakouts brightened the biotech industry group. **Genmab** ([GMAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMAB)) broke out of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) and closed in buy range of the 25.52 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


**Horizon Therapeutics** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) gapped out of a [cup base without a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in big volume after the biotech beat first-quarter expectations and raised its outlook. **Twist Bioscience** ([TWST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWST)) broke out of a lopsided base with a 36.01 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The company identified antibodies to potentially treat Covid-19.


It was unclear why techs and consumer stocks led Wednesday. Those sectors have been leading already and may be just extending their leadership. The best groups in the past five days are mainly software, biotech, internet and some coronavirus industries such as movies, soap and cleaning preparations, and meat products.


Consumer stocks should benefit as more states lift coronavirus restrictions. But the outlook for the sector isn't so rosy with staggering numbers of unemployed. Employment services firm ADP estimated 20 million private sector job losses last month. "The April employment report is going to be one for the history books, which is something the unemployment claims numbers have warned us about for a while now," economist Joel Naroff wrote in a note. "The extent of the payroll decline should exceed any other year, let alone month, in history."


Retail and internet stocks underscored the consumer rally. **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) soared out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) broke out also. Both rallied on earnings reports.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.4%. Much like the broad market, technology stocks were mainly higher. Real estate investment trusts and mining stocks among the laggards.

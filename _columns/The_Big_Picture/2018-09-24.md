Stocks End Mixed; Blue Chips Hit, Nasdaq Recovers; Financials Fall Ahead Of Fed
================================================================================

Blue chip stocks lagged Monday as the Dow Jones snapped a four-session win streak and ended near its session low. The Nasdaq composite held up relatively well, though, as Wall Street pondered another rise in oil prices and news of another potential high-level departure at the White House.




Sixteen Dow components lost 1% more including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)). Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) fell 1.1% ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting.


A decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its key lending rate by another quarter point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. Looking forward to the December meeting, the market sees a 73% chance of another quarter-point hike. That's down from around 80% last week.


Blue Chips Lag, Techs Recover
-----------------------------


At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%. The S&P 500 gave back nearly 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite inched up 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100 reversed higher after falling 1.1% intraday, rising 0.3%. The S&P SmallCap 600 undercut its 50-day moving average, falling 0.7%.


Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in well below Friday's levels â€” no surprise there, since volume was extremely heavy Friday due to options expiration.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP09241818-209x300.jpg)Early in the session, several published reports said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was on his way out, but it's status quo for now ahead of a meeting with President Trump Thursday. Rosenstein currently oversees the Russia probe run by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.


Breadth was poor on the NYSE, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by more than a 2-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by less than 2-to-1.


Tech Stocks Hang Tough
----------------------


A couple of [FANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) and Nasdaq 100 stocks showed notable action. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) breached support at the 50-day moving average, but the stock rallied nicely off lows. Shares ended with a gain of 1%.



Meanwhile, FANG stock and [IBD Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) outperformed nicely, up more than 2%. It's trading just above the 50-day moving average as it works on a [later-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/). Its recent high of 376.81 remains a potential resistance level to watch.


But the news wasn't all good in the Nasdaq 100. **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) plunged 6% after the company beat out **21st Century Fox** ([FOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOX)) to acquire U.K.-based media and telecom firm Sky for $40 billion.


**Sirius XM** ([SIRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIRI)) cratered 10% on news it's buying **Pandora** ([P](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=P)) for $3.5 billion. Last year, Sirius XM invested $480 million in the music-streaming company. Shares of Pandora added 1%.


Distribution Days
-----------------


When it comes to overall market health, the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100 continue to show supporting action at their 50-day moving average lines. For now, this trumps an elevated [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count for the Nasdaq. There have been five distribution days since Sept. 4. That's a lot of short period of time, but only two of the higher-volume declines showed losses of 1% or more.


Energy Stocks On The Move
-------------------------


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) was a top performer as oil prices strengthened again. A weekend meeting involving OPEC and Russia failed to reach a decision to raise output quotas. Benchmark WTI crude oil futures settled at $72.08 a barrel, up 1.8%. Brent jumped 3.1% to $81.20 a barrel.


Among oil and gas producers, **Centennial Resource Development** ([CDEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDEV)) is still in buy range after reclaiming a conventional entry of 21.09. Shares closed up 3% at 21.47. Other E&P firms did well, including **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)).


In the refining group, **Andeavor** ([ANDV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANDV)) is near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 151.98 entry. **Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) [is still in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) from the 82.71 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Among machinery and equipment makers in the energy sector, **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) popped above the 37.48 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares ended at 37.30, up 1.6%.


Outside the oil patch, [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) broke out of a shallow cup pattern. The medical-device maker gapped up and rose nearly 8% in heavy volume. The stock's open price of 160 was a legitimate entry. There's speculation that **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) [might be interested in buying](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medtech-stock-acquisition-rumors/) Edwards.

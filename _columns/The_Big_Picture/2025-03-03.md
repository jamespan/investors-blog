  It Was Supposed To Be A Good Day For The Stock Market. It Didn't Go As Planned.

The stock market was primed to rise Monday, after a rally Sunday in cryptocurrencies followed a promising rebound in Friday's Wall Street session. Overnight futures climbed. Stocks started the regular session higher. But instead, the market closed sharply lower.


Indexes faded quickly after the open. The Nasdaq composite rose as much as 0.8% in early trading, but closed 2.6% lower. At one point, it was down more than 3%.




It was disheartening action after the composite Friday found support at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). Instead, the Nasdaq closed Monday slightly below its 200-day line.


In a similar way, the S&P 500 on Friday bounced after testing support around the 5,830 level. Yet, there was no follow-on buying Monday and the index lost 1.8%.


Some stock market heavyweights such as **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also appeared to be bouncing off support levels Friday after months of weak price action. But those stocks resumed their losing ways Monday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed back above its flattening 50-day moving average Friday but went right back below it Monday. It lost 1.5% for the day.


Volume eased on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. Breadth was decisively on the bears' side. Decliners outnumbered advancers by 7-to-3 on the NYSE and by 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq, according to FactSet.


The crypto rally, which started with details on a U.S. crypto reserve from President Donald Trump, also evaporated. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index plunged nearly 9% to $85,936.55. It's the largest decrease since Aug. 5, Dow Jones Market Data said.


Sellers are refusing to go away, and with indexes in further disarray, IBD again cut its [recommended stock market exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), this time to 0% to 20%.


Effectively, this lowest-possible level means the market is in a correction. Investors should avoid buying stocks and instead take profits, leaving only the strongest holdings in their portfolios. Cash will be investors' friend until bottoming signals start to appear. More than ever, it is paramount to [follow sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/).


Economic Data Shows Tariff Effects
----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP030325.jpg)Perhaps it was too much to ask for the stock market to rally Monday. Wall Street is carrying a boulder on its shoulders, as a deadline loomed Tuesday for 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. President Trump [confirmed Monday afternoon](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-03-03-2025?mod=hp_lead_pos7) those tariffs would go into effect, which caused the stock market to sink further.


Tariffs appear to be already impacting factory activity. The S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI climbed to 52.7 in February. But Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the gains "may only be skin deep."


Although manufacturing production grew at the best rates since May 2022, and new orders increased at the best pace in a year, much of it was due to companies and customers building up inventories to beat price hikes and supply issues they expect from tariffs.


"Business optimism about the year ahead has consequently fallen compared to the buoyant mood evident in January, with February seeing an increase in the number of companies citing concerns over tariffs and other policies introduced by the new Trump administration," Williamson added.


Small caps — which are more sensitive to the U.S. economy — remained adrift, with the Russell 2000 wiping out all of Friday's gains and marking a nearly six-month closing low.


Stock Market Volatility Rising
------------------------------


Frayed investor nerves are showing up in market volatility. Intraday Nasdaq volatility — the average spread between the daily highs and lows over a 10-day period — is at two percentage points, the highest spread since Aug. 16, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Further, the [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), also known as the VIX, closed above 20 for the second time in three sessions. It hadn't closed above 20 since Dec. 18-19.


And the 10-year note's yield fell five basis points to 4.178%, the lowest since Dec. 6. The benchmark yield is now below its 200-day moving average. Often, stock investors cheer declines in Treasury yields, but the borrowing rate is falling largely because of concerns about the economy.

The poor state of many leading growth stocks is another reason to be mainly in cash. The IBD 50 index fell 2.5%. **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)), **BeiGene** ([ONC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONC)), **GeneDx** ([WGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGS)), **FTAI Aviation** ([FTAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTAI)) and **Zai Lab** ([ZLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZLAB)) all fell more than 7%.


**Remitly Global** ([RELY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RELY)) closed below its 50-day line for the first time since October, when it was basing. **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Commvault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) and **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) are among the leaders teetering at their 50-day lines.


Several IBD 50 stocks have already hit sell signals, including **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)), **ACM Research** ([ACMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACMR)), which was more than 7% below its buy point. Another is **Travere Therapeutics** ([TVTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TVTX)), which erased a 27% gain from its buy point.

Stock indexes withered Thursday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The Nasdaq was up almost 0.4% a minute before the announcement, rallied more than 1% soon after it, and reversed to close with an 0.1% gain. The S&P 500 reversed to an 0.3% loss.

  

The IBD 50 advanced 0.6%.

  

Volume rose across the board after being down before the Fed announcement.

  

Overall, the action constituted stalling on the Nasdaq and distribution on the S&P 500. Stalling is a form of distribution that occurs on up days.

  

While the distribution count remains low, the action was in some ways disturbing. The finishes low in the day's range were atypical for the close of a Fed meeting. Closes high in the day's range were a characteristic of the previous four Fed meetings.

  

Could it be that near-zero interest rates are losing whatever appeal they had for the market?

  

In the run-up to the decision, CME Group FedWatch had calculated the chance of a rate hike at roughly one in four.

  

In the end, the odds prevailed.

  

Bank stocks, however, clearly weren't happy about it. Look at the chart of almost any bank stock, and it will likely show a negative reversal.

  

Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the super-regional bank group was the day's worst performer.

  

Higher interest rates would give banks better profit margins and eventually the ability to embrace a more aggressive strategy. Lower rates and lower profit margins discourage loans, particularly those to smaller, riskier and more dynamic businesses.

  

Dynamic action among stocks was scarce before and after the Fed's announcement. Top-rated stocks weren't doing much before the Fed's announcement. Among screens for the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and 85-85, only two stocks rose in strong volume and one fell before the announcement. The two up were airline **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and apparel marketer **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)). The down issue was chipmaker **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)).

  

After the announcement, the list stayed rather thin, gaining only a few more names.

  

The best-performing groups for the day included biotechs, airlines and gold miners.

  

Apart from the Fed, economic news was mixed. Housing starts for August were weaker than expected, but permits were above the consensus estimate. First-time jobless claims were less than estimated, but the Philadelphia Fed's business outlook survey was worse than expected.

The stock market turned in another orderly performance Tuesday, refusing to give up much ground after big gains for the major stock indexes since the start of the month.




With two trading days left in November, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite eked out modest gains of 0.1% to 0.3%. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was one of the top gainers in the S&P 500, up 4.5%. TSLA stock broke out of a downward trend line with a strong move above the 50-day moving average ahead of the company's Cybertruck delivery event late Thursday.


Small caps lagged again as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slipped 0.4%. IWM is still toiling below its 200-day moving average. Stock market bulls want to see IWM move with conviction above its 200-day line, but it's been lacking energy so far.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Declining stocks on the Nasdaq edged out advancers by a small margin. On the NYSE, winners had a slight edge over losers.


Distribution days have been virtually nonexistent during the stock market rally, providing a nice tailwind for the stock market. And top growth stocks continue to act well.


Several security software stocks moved higher in heavy volume.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) reversed higher for a gain of 1% after falling nearly 5% at the open. Late Monday, the company reported [strong earnings and gave bullish guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zscaler-earnings-guidance-top-views-amid-high-expectations/). But investors were spooked early after Zscaler left its billings guidance unchanged at $2.54 billion. The company also said it plans to ramp up sales and marketing, which could pressure margins.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP112823-287x300.jpg)Group peer **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) rallied for the sixth time in seven sessions after a recent earnings sell-off. PANW closed near the top of the buy zone from a 265.90 entry, but it already looks extended with the stock up nearly 15% over the past seven sessions.


Palo Alto Networks and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, along with **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), another Leaderboard stock. DDOG could try to add a handle to its current pattern as the stock approaches its July high of 118. Keep an eye out for a low-volume pullback.


Economic Data
-------------


Economic data on tap Wednesday includes the second estimate to Q3 GDP, which is expected to be unchanged from the first reading of 4.9%.


The big report comes Thursday. That's when the release of the Personal Income & Spending report for October is slated. Inside the data, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is expected to dip to 3.5% from 3.7%. Core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, but it's above the Fed's benchmark of 2%. Still, the stock market is growing more confident that the Fed's work is done.

The 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 4.33% just after the stock market close, down 6 basis points. The stock market uptrend still looks strong with bond yields and the U.S. dollar under pressure. But a sudden rise in yields or renewed strength in the dollar could cause some headwinds for stocks.


But it's hard to see this scenario playing out, at least in the near term, as the stock market weighs the possibility of a sharper-than-expected slowdown for the economy next year. The Fed knows this is a possibility, too, so they're in no hurry to raise rates at this point.


As it stands now, the [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) tool thinks a rate cut could come as early as the March Fed meeting.


The weak dollar fueled another rally for gold stocks. **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)) gave a buy signal by jumping above its 200-day line and its Oct. 20 high of 17.14. Meanwhile, South African gold miner **Gold Fields** ([GFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFI)) also soared past a 14.52 handle entry.


Stocks To Watch
---------------



The challenge for growth investors now is finding stocks that aren't extended after making big moves. While some stocks like **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), **Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX))and **CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)) are building bases, the question is, do these stocks have the potential to be true stock market leaders? Keep in mind that the strongest performers started moving in early November after follow-through days for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.


One stock building a base that's worth watching is recent IPO **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)). It's a classic first-stage structure after the chip designer went public in September at 51 per share.


In 2020, Nvidia offered to buy Arm from Softbank for $40 billion, but the chip leader walked away from the deal last year due to regulatory scrutiny.


Online travel firm **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) is also in a good setup as it adds a handle to its four-month-old consolidation.

U.S. stock indexes sold off into Thursday's close after the market initially shrugged off disappointing economic news.


The Nasdaq sawed off 1.1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The IBD 50 slid 1.9%. Volume rose across the board.


![MP042816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP042816-160x300.jpg)A distribution day on March 23 fell off both indexes because it is now too old to count, but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered fresh distribution Thursday. Distribution involves a loss in rising volume and points to institutional selling.


In recent sessions, the indexes have suffered a cluster of distribution days -- four in eight sessions.


On Thursday, the Nasdaq closed under its 200-day moving average for the first time in almost three weeks. However, the composite remains above its 50-day line. The S&P 500 is above both key lines.


News provided support for the bearish camp Thursday.


Before the open, the market received news from the Bank of Japan. Easy-money advocates were expecting more easing, but Japan stood pat on its mix.


Also before the open, the early take on U.S. first-quarter GDP was released. The Street expected growth of 0.7% but got 0.5%.


The market's initial shrug was probably context-related. In the previous three quarters, the advance GDP number (vs. the final figure) proved low by 160 basis points, then by 50 and most recently 70 basis points.


As more complete data emerge, two more takes on Q1 GDP will be announced in May and June.


Elsewhere, the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing survey's needle hit -4, signaling contraction. However, the previous two readings were -6 in March and -12 in February. While the negative readings are decelerating, -4 is still a negative number.


First-time jobless claims provided the sole bright spot. Claims were 1% lower than expected.


The major indexes were either up or flat until around 2 p.m. Eastern time, when the sellers began to step in aggressively.


For individual stocks, however, the focus remained on quarterly results.


**MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) beat the Street’s numbers on the top and bottom lines but erased early gains to fall 1% in fast trade.


**Proto Labs** ([PRLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRLB)) plunged 22% after missing EPS and sales estimates.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) topped the Street’s numbers on earnings and sales late Wednesday. The stock gapped up to a 7% gain Thursday.


After hours Thursday, quarterly reports from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) sent the two up 12% and 8%, respectively.

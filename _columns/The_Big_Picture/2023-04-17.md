Buyers came out Monday afternoon, as the stock market got through unsettling reports in the banking sector and wiped out earlier losses. Small caps and the IBD 50 outperformed.




Moderate gains kept the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rangebound.


The Nasdaq reversed higher for a 0.3% gain Monday. But the index faces resistance around 12,250 at a time when it's starting to lag. Although it continues to lead the stock market this year, the Nasdaq's relative strength line slipped the past three weeks or so.


That's largely because the S&P 500 — despite facing its own resistance levels — has climbed about 6% in the past month. That bodes well for the weeks ahead, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.


Since 2000, there were 27 quarters when the S&P 500 rallied at least 3% four weeks before the start of earnings season. The average and median returns in the seven-week period that followed were 1.4% and 3.1%, respectively, Turnquist said.


On Monday, the S&P and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.3%.


Small Caps And IBD 50 Outperform
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP041723-240x300.jpg)Smaller stocks and growth leaders led the stock market Monday. The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.2% gain. The IBD 50 Index rose 0.8%. **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), **Intra-Cellular Therapies** ([ITCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITCI)), **Perion Network** ([PERI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PERI)) and **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) rose 3.5% to 7%. Only 12 of the 50 stocks fell.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq.


The sum of index action, volume and leading stocks made for a positive day on Wall Street. But are investors too complacent?


The [CBOE Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, is at the lowest since January 2022. You might recall the bear market took hold about that time. Options experts say the surge in option trades that expire the same day (zero days to expiration) is skewing the VIX. Still, it's an indicator to watch.


Megacaps Lag In Stock Market
----------------------------


It was a day off for megacaps, which have been leading for much of this year. Vanguard Mega Cap ETF ([MGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGC)) rose 0.3% while Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) climbed 0.7%. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) rose 0.4%, beating the Invesco QQQ Trust'sQQQ gain of less than 0.1%.


Megacap **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) slid 2.7% Monday after the New York Times reported smartphone maker Samsung could switch to **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) [Bing as its default search engine](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-alphabet-falls-on-report-samsung-could-switch-to-microsoft-search-engine/), ditching longtime partner Google. The move could cost Google $3 billion in annual revenue, the report said.


Microsoft stock rose 0.9%, but not enough to offset Alphabet's loss.


Financial-sector jitters resurfaced with [Monday's financial reports](https://www.investors.com/news/charles-schwab-stock-rises-after-earnings-beat-pauses-buybacks-banks-roll-out-results-after-march-panic/). But fears gave way to optimism by the close.


Bank Earnings Mixed, But Stock Market Shrugs
--------------------------------------------



**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) gave a mixed first-quarter report, and said it is pausing its share buyback program due to industry and regulatory uncertainty. Yet, the stock reversed higher and closed nearly 4% higher. Shares appear to have found support around 50, though they have a lot of ground to make up.


**M&T Bank** ([MTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTB)) rallied 7.8% after beating earnings estimates early Monday. It was the best S&P 500 stock, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


But **State Street** ([STT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STT)) sold off 9.2%, even after trimming losses. The world's fourth-largest asset manager and ETF heavyweight missed estimates. Earnings fell 3.2% to $1.52 per share while revenue ticked up to $3.1 billion.


**Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) gapped down below its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), down 4.6% after reducing its early loss. State Street and Bank of New York were among the worst performing stocks in the S&P.


Nonetheless, the stock market looked undeterred. Finance Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) rose 1.2% and is up more than 9% since the March 24 low. SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) climbed 2.3%, and has formed a good floor of support above 35.


This action supports the notion that investors are less concerned about a banking meltdown.


The bond market seems to agree. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 3.59%. It was the third-straight increase for the benchmark yield, rising 17 basis points in that time.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) will report quarterly results Tuesday, as [earnings reports remain a focal point](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/). **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) are other bellwether companies to watch.


The economic calendar is not too busy, but several Fed officials will be speaking throughout the week.

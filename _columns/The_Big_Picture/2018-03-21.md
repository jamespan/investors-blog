title: Indexes Reverse Lower After Fed Rate Hike: 4 Reasons Why The Stock Market Drop Wasn't So Bad

While the late-afternoon reversal Wednesday may have looked pretty bad, it actually wasn't that bad.




The major indexes enjoyed decent gains, then acted like the rug was pulled out from underneath. The Nasdaq composite forfeited a 0.7% intraday advance and fell almost 0.3%. Volume inched higher, handing the leading index a fourth distribution day since Feb. 27. The current outlook for the market remains at "uptrend under pressure."


The S&P 500 went from a 0.8% gain to a loss of just under 0.2%. Because the decline did not hit 0.2% or more, there was no chance that the large-cap benchmark would add another distribution (significant drop in higher volume vs. the prior session) to its already heavy load.


Why was it a little bit topsy-turvy?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP032118-242x300.png)In one of the most highly anticipated events on Wall Street in weeks, the Federal Reserve did what practically everyone expected. The fed funds rate jumped by a quarter point, extending a campaign of monetary tightening to six such hikes in short-term interest rates that go back to December 2015. The target range is now at 1.5%-1.75%.


That's still peanuts in terms of the cost of money compared with the period of June 2006 to August 2007, when the fed funds rate stood tall at 5.25%.


Yet the statement and conference call presided for the first time by new Fed chief Jerome Powell appeared to only add a little more uncertainty to one of the biggest questions for U.S. financial markets: Will it be three rate hikes this year, like in 2017, or four?


The statement itself dryly noted that growth has moderated, particularly in the "growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment." However, it also added this sentence: "The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months." Plus, the members of the interest rate policy board showed more confidence that prices on a 12-month basis are expected to "move up in coming months" and hit the Fed's 2% inflation objective.


Later in the session, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rushed higher and hit as high as 2.93%, coming closer to breaching the year-to-date peak.


Even though the Nasdaq staged a negative reversal, it's been one of the milder ones so far in recent months. The 0.3% drop feels like a pittance compared with, say, the March 1 reversal in which the tech-driven index dropped 1.3%, gave the Nasdaq its fourth distribution day, and triggered a downgrade in IBD's current outlook for the market.


Wednesday's action also featured these four positive elements:


**One: The top market leaders still look good**. In [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), just two of the 12 companies in the Leaders list showed significantly above-average turnover: **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), which fell 1% in volume that climbed 19% above its 50-day average; and China's auto website **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), up 3%.

The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange-traded fund edged up 0.2%. The ETF rose more than 30% in 2017.


**Two: Market internals actually look solid**. Breadth was positive, with winners trumping losers by around 17 to 11 on the Nasdaq, 4 to 3 on the NYSE. Looking at the top IBD industry groups of the day, as many as 31 groups rallied 1% or more, ranging from oil and gas machinery to automakers to steel to chip equipment to homebuilders.


**Three: The small caps prevailed**. The Russell 2000 crushed the large-cap indexes with a gain of almost 0.6%. At 1579, the Russell is now up 2.9% year to date, doubling the S&P 500's 1.4% dividend-free gain.


Dozens of companies trading at least 10 a share and holding a 95 Composite Rating or higher hit 52-week or all-time highs. Some of them are on IBD's top growth screens, including Sector Leaders, which is chock-full with 16 companies, as well as the IBD 50, IPO Leaders and Stock Spotlight.


A broadly growing economy is a big boon to small and medium businesses. Plus, with President Trump's threat to slap more tariffs on Chinese imports following the 25% tariff on cheap foreign steel, perhaps institutions are actively taking a lighter approach toward those companies with market values of $15 billion or more.


**Four: Will leadership rotate again?** On Wednesday, crude oil prices spiked up again as the U.S. dollar declined. U.S. near-term futures jumped nearly 3% and hit as high as $65.52 a barrel. No wonder then, that companies such as **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) and **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) are looking much better lately. Continental is forming the right side of a new cup base.

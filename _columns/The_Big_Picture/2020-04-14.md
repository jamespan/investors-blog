  Stock Market Rally Heats Up As New Coronavirus Cases Show Flattening Signs

The stock market rally is bending the bear backward.




The Nasdaq composite rolled almost 4% higher Tuesday. Its sibling index, the Nasdaq 100, soared 4.3%. Both indexes closed above their 50-day moving average for the first time since February.


The S&P 500 rallied nearly 3.1% and is close to achieving the same feat.


Volume rose sharply on the Nasdaq, a sign that institutions are putting fresh capital to work. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq has shot up so fast in recent days that it wiped the lone [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on its count, a miserly 0.3% decline in higher turnover on April 7.


Tuesday served as the first day of major earnings results for S&P 500 firms. A 2.7% drop in **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) after weak Q1 results (adjusted EPS down 71%, revenue falling 9% to register the first drop in the top line since Q1 2016) splashed cold water on the idea of rushing back into financials. [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) flagged numerous money center banks falling in heavy volume.


Fund managers appear encouraged by data showing that new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. are mirroring a slowing trend as seen in Spain, Italy, France and Germany.


Stock Market Rally: This Element Is Present
-------------------------------------------



[A follow-through on April 2](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) by the S&P 500 sent the first salvo against short sellers and other pessimists. Then the Nasdaq composite followed suit, launching its own confirmation rally with a huge gain in higher turnover on April 6.


Even after that 7.3% lift by the Nasdaq, however, IBD readers would have felt justified feeling reluctant about returning to the market.


After all, the [vertical violation in late February to early March](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/) unleashed the swiftest bear market-size correction in modern history.


Yet in addition to a streak of solid daily advances and smaller declines, the market's past few sessions have produced a subtle change.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP041419-216x300.jpg)Companies with outstanding fundamentals are breaking out of [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Or they are striding past [early entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) for the advanced chart reader. A brigade of other stocks are busily climbing back above their 50-day and 10-week moving averages, marching toward their 52-week peaks. More signs of life are emerging in key stock lists such as [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) (which on Monday expanded to a quartet of stocks), [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


In short, you can't trust a new uptrend unless it's featuring a growing number of [solid, exciting breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


It may be still too early to conclude that the greater market will notch a higher gear. But recent gains indicate that the big guns on Wall Street are looking past well-anticipated weakness in first- and second-quarter results among corporate giants and at the potential for an economic recovery in the second half of the year.


Stock Market Rally: Internals Improve
-------------------------------------


Advancing issues topped declining ones by a 5-2 ratio on the Nasdaq. The exchange's advance-decline line looks set to reassume its rocky climb since late March. Indeed, you want to see the A-D line rise during a general uptrend.


On the NYSE, winners spanked losers by a nearly 3-to-1 margin.


You can view the NYSE's A-D line inside the large daily chart of the S&P 500 in the "General Market Indicators" PDF page, found as a link at the bottom of each Big Picture column.


New highs among stocks remain sparse. **E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)) noted just 74 stocks and ETFs hitting new 52-week or all-time highs on the Nasdaq and NYSE. But new lows have plummeted. On April 2, 186 companies made new lows on the two main exchanges. On Monday, the Nasdaq and NYSE hosted just 17 new lows together.


[As seen in the latest IBD New High List](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-apr-14-2020/), 33 companies on the Nasdaq marked new highs vs. 12 new lows on Tuesday. On the NYSE, new highs edged new lows 19 to 5.


The Medical sector held the top spot within the new highs list with eight stocks, followed by Mining (think gold) at 5, Software, Retail and Chips, each supplying two stocks apiece.

Buy With Discipline
-------------------



**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and a few other names [reentering the ranks of Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) make up a few of the latest highly rated growth stocks that have recently broken out to new highs.


Veeva and Qualys join scores of top-notch companies highlighted in features such as [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-rises-639-points-russell-2000-up-4-5-will-this-cloud-stock-torch-the-bears/), [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/), [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/). Qualys shares on Tuesday have gotten [extended from a 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) after breaking out of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at 94.82.


If this uptrend is truly tradable, new breakouts may emerge two, three or four months from now.


**Xerox** ([XRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRX)) offers a great historical example. The innovator of photocopiers worked on a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) for months after the market staged a follow-through on Oct. 29, 1962, as noted in a [MarketSmith weekly Take On The Market webinar](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). But the breakout on April 3, 1963, showed pizazz. Shares surged 145% from a 164.23 buy point in seven months.

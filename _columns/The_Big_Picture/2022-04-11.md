The Nasdaq composite weakened further and the S&P 500 teetered at a key chart level Monday as the stock market began a week fraught with headline risks.




The S&P 500 tumbled 1.7% and closed slightly below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The index now tries to find support at that level. But if the Nasdaq is any indication, the composite melted right through its 50-day line Monday after a tentative hold on it the previous two sessions.


The Nasdaq gapped down to a loss of 2.2% as technology stocks again were sellers' favorite target. Chip equipment, internet content, biotech and a few software industry groups fell more than 1.5%.


Major techs such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reflected doubts about the sector. Apple fell below its 50-day line. Microsoft's 3.9% gap-down loss left it deeper below the 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Alphabet's five-day losing streak is the longest since November 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Nvidia slid 5.2%; its five-day drop is the largest since March 2020.Â Robert W. Baird downgraded Nvidia to neutral from outperform and cut the price target to 225 from 360.


The S&P 500 remains above the close on March 16. That's significant because that was when the S&P made its [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). So, technically, the S&P's uptrend is alive, though ailing.


Bearish Signal For Nasdaq
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP041122-250x300.jpg)But the Nasdaq has undercut the low of March 18, when it made its own [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). With that level busted, investors should regard the Nasdaq to be in a correction. If you've invested in the market with Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), for example, it's a good idea to sell. The Nasdaq 100 ETF gapped below its 50-day line Monday.


And technology wasn't even the day's worst sector. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) fell 3% after the price of U.S. crude oil continued a retreat. Nymex May futures fell 4% to $94.29 a barrel.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2% and closed below its 50-day line for the first time since March 23.


Elsewhere in the stock market, small caps withstood the sell-off a bit better, as the Russell 2000 fell 0.7%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, adding a third [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the index. NYSE volume also rose, wich gave the S&P 500 a distribution day.


Stock Market Risk From CPI, Earnings
------------------------------------


On Tuesday before the market opens trading, the consumer price index for March will be released. The consensus estimate is for a 1.1% increase from the previous month, and 8.4% from the year-ago period, [according to Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


With inflation readings running around 40-year highs, the report is drawing big interest on Wall Street. Inflation is forcing the Fed to raise interest rates and shed assets from its balance sheet. Investors are betting on a half-point interest rate increase at the next meeting on monetary policy.


No wonder the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed for a seventh straight day. It added 7 basis points to 2.78% Monday, the highest since January 2019.


Also coming this week is the start of first-quarter earnings season. A [number of major financials are set to report earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), including **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) on Wednesday, and then **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **State Street** ([STT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STT)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) on Thursday.



Banks, a significant sector within the stock market, tend to benefit from rising interest rates as their margins improve. But SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) is near six-month lows, and the industry faces a weak first-quarter profit picture, at least among the larger banks.


Banks are expected to suffer the largest year-over-year earnings decline of the five industries that make up the S&P financial sector, according to FactSet. The banking industry's 36% profit tumble is the largest factor in the sector's estimated 25.7% drop in profits.


S&P Banks Face Earnings Drag
----------------------------


One key factor is that banks are expected to report significantly higher provisions for loan losses in Q1 of this year relative to a year ago, says FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters. While provisions for loan losses have no impact on the top line, they do impact the bottom line because they are treated like an expense on the income statement.


"Banks then substantially reduced their provisions for loan losses in the first half of 2021, with restrictions easing and economic conditions improving during that period," Butters added in a report. "Banks now appear to be setting these provisions back to near pre-pandemic levels for Q1 2022 (and going forward), but are facing difficult comparisons to the much lower (negative) numbers from Q1 2021."


In all, the 18 S&P banks are estimated to report $3.1 billion in provisions for loan losses in Q1 compared with -$11.4 billion in Q1 of 2021.


Geopolitical risk is taking on a new dimension. In Ukraine, fighting with Russian troops has eased around Kyiv, but [forces are marshaling around eastern Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-russia-send-reinforcements-for-pitched-battles-in-conflicts-next-phase-11649588496?mod=article_inline). Russia appears to be focusing its efforts on the Donbas region.


The IBD 50 fell 2.1%. Ten of the 50 stocks fell more than 4%, and two plunged more than 10%. **LSB Industries** ([LXU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LXU)) fell 10.1% in heavy volume, though it held above the 21-day exponential moving average. **Pacira BioSciences** ([PCRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCRX)) slid 10.3% in nearly three times its average volume, falling below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

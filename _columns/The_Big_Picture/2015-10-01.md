Stocks wandered to a nearly flat finish Thursday, unable to follow up much on the previous session's big gains. The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%, while the S&P added 0.2%. The IBD 50 rose 0.7%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The day's action did nothing to remove the doubts surrounding the market. While the Nasdaq this week bounced off the 4500 level and erased a loss of more than 1% Thursday, it isn't certain that the test is over. The index is less than 3% above that area.

  

The market is still struggling to patch a big hole in confidence after a sharp and quick sell-off in August. From the Aug. 17 close to the intraday low on Aug. 24, the Nasdaq shed 15.7% in five days and dropped 18% off its high.

  

A quick and deep dive is hard to forget. If recent history is any guide, it can lead to months of choppy action. Consider the other two instances when it happened since 2009.

  

•The Nasdaq plunged 15.4% over seven sessions in August 2011. The index then hacked around for more than four months before launching a tight and well-ordered uptrend.

  

•The Nasdaq knifed 13% lower over five sessions in May 2010. Trouble persisted for almost four months before a steady uptrend began in September 2010.

  

The key takeaway is the roughly four months of difficult action that followed the quick drops.

  

So if the current market follows the same pattern, then choppy action is likely for about three more months.

  

Although history is worth knowing, it can't predict the future. The market could find its bearings in less than four months, or it could drive far deeper south.

  

With the market in correction, individual investors have an easy way to handle the situation: Avoid new buys, but stay alert.

  

They also might keep in mind that a bottom can be a process defined over weeks and months rather than a specific low.

  

On Thursday, economic news was mixed. U.S. car sales in September were strong, with **GM** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) and **Nissan** ([NSANY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSANY)) topping expectations. Construction spending in August was modestly higher than expected.

  

However, first-time jobless claims and the Challenger Gray & Christmas report on September layoffs disappointed.

  

On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payroll and jobless data for September. The Street expects 203,000 jobs, with unemployment unchanged at 5.1%.

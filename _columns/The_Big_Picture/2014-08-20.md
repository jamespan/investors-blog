The stock market showed dull action Wednesday â€” perhaps a day when dull is actually a good thing.


The biggest item on equity trading desks' minds was likely the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July 29-30 meeting on interest rates, released at 2 p.m. ET. Market watchers look at such reports to find any fresh clues about how and when the U.S. central bank will raise the cost of money.


The report caused a sell-off that lasted roughly 20 minutes. Strength soon returned to the market. As seen on the daily charts on the "What's the Market Trend?" page on B2, the brief sell-off made no lasting mark.


The S&P 500 advanced 0.2% for its fifth gain in six sessions. Since the Aug. 7 near-term low of 1904.78, the large-cap benchmark has risen 4.3%.


The Nasdaq composite was off a point, snapping a five-session win streak. The IBD 50 was flat.


Wednesday's trading range in the Nasdaq was ultratight. That's positive, considering the rapid run-up in recent weeks. The spread between the day's low and high was less than 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq. That's exactly what you want to see on the first down session since the Nasdaq's Day 4 follow-through that took place Aug. 13, marking a newly confirmed uptrend. NYSE traded also eased.


Leading stocks, meanwhile, continue to show mild progress. **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) (surpassed a 53.41 buy point Tuesday), **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) (134.12 entry on Aug. 13), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) (90.84 three-weeks-tight entry) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) (82.45 early entry in cup with handle) all have acted well since rushing past proper entries.


The Fed minutes revealed mostly the same sentiment that has been reported for months. The U.S. central bank's top dogs showed mixed views on both inflation and the labor market. The committee revised near and medium-term forecasts for inflation, but projected a step down in pace in the second half of 2014.


On the jobs side, no one doubted that conditions improved in recent months. However, a few committee members indicated that the "pass-through of labor costs has been more attenuated since the mid-1980s and that wage pressures might not be a reliable leading indicator of higher inflation."


Small caps were less lucky. The small-cap S&P 600 remains sluggish, down 0.6% Wednesday. The daily chart reveals the index still struggling to reclaim its key 50-day moving average.

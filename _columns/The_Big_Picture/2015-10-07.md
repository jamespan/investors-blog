==================================================

A solid open for stocks faded about two hours into Wednesday's session, but an afternoon rally and close near highs was a welcome development for the bulls' camp.

  

An early 0.8% rise for the Nasdaq faded to a loss of 0.4% in morning trade, but buyers lifted the tech-heavy index to an 0.9% gain by the close.

  

The S&P 500 added 0.8%. It poked above its 50-day moving average but ended just below the line. If the index were to retake the line with conviction, it would improve the market's technical health dramatically.

  

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Tuesday's levels, indicating some institutional conviction behind the buying. The performance was good to see after a mild distribution day for the Nasdaq Tuesday.

  

Breadth was good as advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by more than 3-to-1. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

  

The IBD 50 bounced back, rising 1.4%, after a rough session Tuesday that saw the index of leading growth stocks slump 1.6%. Biotech components **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) were among the best percentage gainers.

  

Friday's follow-through for the S&P 500 is looking pretty good so far. Several recent breakouts in the IBD 50 are working, including **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **Universal Insurance** ([UVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVE)) and security software maker **Verisign** ([VRSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSN)).

  

Meanwhile, plenty of other IBD 50 names are setting up, including **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)), **Equifax** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)), **Cognizant** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) and **Blackhawk Network** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)).

  

The next catalyst for the market could be the minutes from the September Fed meeting. They're due Thursday at 2 p.m. ET. The odds of a rate hike at the October meeting have fallen precipitously in recent weeks.

  

Another catalyst is earnings season. It kicks into gear next week with Q3 reports due from several financials.

  

Earnings news was mixed Wednesday. IBD 50 component **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) gapped out of a base on strong earnings. Shares soared 11% to a new high.

  

But **Yum Brands** ([YUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YUM)) crashed 19% on results , mostly due to sluggish sales in China. Yum Brands is a good example of how resistance at the 10-week moving average can often lead to more price weakness. Yum first started getting resistance at the line in July.

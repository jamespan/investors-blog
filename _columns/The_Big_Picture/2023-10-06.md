The stock market reversed higher Friday after investors took heart from a silver lining following a hot jobs report. Now attention will turn to the latest Fed minutes release.




The Nasdaq composite swashbuckled its way out of negative territory as it ended the week's final session with a meaty 1.6% gain. The index closed near highs for the week and turned in a 1.6% lift for that period to boot. The tech-heavy index now is closing in on its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) after rising for a second week in a row. It is now up more than 29% so far in 2023.


The S&P 500 also rallied out of the red as it rose 1.2%. Its weekly rise of 0.5% snapped a four-week losing streak. It remains nearly 3% below its 50-day line, however. The benchmark index is now up nearly 13% this year.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes, but still rose 0.9%. It remains below its 200-day line after falling slightly for the week. **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) were the top performers while **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) lagged.


Small caps also gained, with the Russell 2000 climbing 0.8%. Growth stocks fared even better though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) surging 2.1%.


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP100623-300x282.jpg)Stocks moved higher despite the fact that Treasury yields also rallied. The 10-year yield jumped eight basis points to 4.80%, while the two-year yield popped six basis points to 5.09%. The yield curve remains inverted.


The day's substantial gains triggered a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on the Nasdaq composite as it rallied in volume. While this means the market is back in a confirmed uptrend, IBD is recommending investors hold market exposure in the 20%-40% range at this early stage. Increased exposure at a measured pace is recommended along with taking full advantage of the watchlist built up during the correction period.


Fed Minutes, Inflation Data On Deck
-----------------------------------


The stock market initially reacted negatively to the news the U.S. had added 336,000 new jobs in September. This was far in excess of expectations for 170,000 new positions. But the fact wage growth was softer than expected seemed to embolden the bulls.


But investors now will have to turn their attention to more crucial economic data in the coming week. The minutes for the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting are due Wednesday, which should offer further clues into the thinking of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues on interest rates going forward.


In addition, more inflation data is on deck. First, Producer Price Index data is set for release Wednesday. The next day, the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for September is also due. CPI measures prices at the end user level. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, is seen rising 4.1% year-over-year.

On the earnings front, financial firms, including **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), are set to report. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is another noteworthy firm expected to post results.


These Stock Market Groups Shine
-------------------------------


Nearly all the S&P 500 sectors closed higher. Technology and communication services were the strongest areas while consumer staples lagged.


Once again, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave investors a deeper insight on the inner workings of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Security software stocks, U.S. and international oil and gas explorers, database and enterprise software firms and solar stocks all turned in eye-catching gains.


On the downside, the discount chain group, which features the likes of Walmart, **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), restaurants, toy companies and food wholesalers all struggled.

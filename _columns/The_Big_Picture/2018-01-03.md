  Nasdaq Leads Again; What Today's Rally Says About This Bull Market

Judging by the latest minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting on interest rates, one might conclude this: Even the most influential bankers of the free world are not certain about how fast prices will rise in 2018.


 Did that matter to equity trading desks around the globe? Judging by Wednesday's gains in the major U.S. indexes, it surely didn't seem so.


The Nasdaq composite, the leading index in 2017, took the pacesetter role again as it stormed 0.8% higher. The Nasdaq 100, which assembles the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, rallied almost 1%. Both indexes staged new all-time highs.


At 7,065, the Nasdaq composite has now gained nearly 46% since it signaled a market turn with a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP010318-180x300.png)The S&P 500, benefiting from another round of urgent buying in energy, consumer, construction and semiconductor stocks, rose 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrials, hampered in part by a sharp sell-off in tech component **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), assumed a backseat position for a second straight day. The blue chip index rose 0.4%.


Intel dropped as much as 7% before cutting its losses on news that it's working on patching a security hole in its chips. The megacap tech ended the day down 3.3% in nearly four times average volume, yet managed to close above the key 50-day moving average.


In its minutes from the Dec. 12-13 meeting, the U.S. central bank revealed a lack of unanimity over whether the goal of a minimum 2% annual rate of inflation will be achieved this year. Indeed, a pair of members of the FOMC board disagreed with the decision last month to push the fed funds rate by another quarter point to a 1.25%-1.5% target zone.


With a major tax cut now in place, the Fed appears confident the economy will continue to grow. It sees further interest rate hikes as warranted given that the economy is accelerating. However, the language seen in the minutes strongly suggests that the Fed, which will soon be led by incoming chair Jerome Powell, will still take a gradual approach to both raising the cost of money and reducing its bloated balance sheet full of Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities.


Some economists expect the Fed to do in 2018 what it did in 2017: raise short-term interest rates three times, each by a quarter point. If that happens, the fed funds rate would hit a range of 2% to 2.25%.


That's still well below the historical norm. Consider this: In 1987, the year of the mighty [Black Monday stock market crash](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/could-you-have-spotted-the-1987-stock-market-top-yes-heres-how/) in October that year, the fed funds rate rose from 6% to a year-to-date high of 7.3125%. (Back then, the Fed used fractions. In this case, the peak rate for 1987 was 7 5/16%.) In 1997, the fed funds rate held at 5.5% for the entire year. And in 2007, the rate was at a multiyear peak of 6.25% until the central bank began cutting rates in August that year.


While the [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) certainly had a lot to do with the Nasdaq's handsome advance on Wednesday, some of the best looking charts also come from non-tech regions of the market, including discount retail (think **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE))) and housing (such as entry level homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH))).


Five Below, which sports year-over-year EPS increases of 38%, 25%, 17%, 25%, 67% and 80% in the past six quarters, has climbed more than 30% since clearing a shallow cup-style base at 54.23 in late September. LGI has ramped up 57% since passing a 50.05 buy point on Oct. 2. The Texas-based construction play is expected to post record earnings ($4.56 a share in 2017, up 34% and $5.55 in 2018, up 22%).


Both of these true stock market leaders gained sharply in above-average trading, and thus got included in the accompanying Market Pulse table's "Leaders up in volume" section.



Five Below and LGI represent what's new in the economy and they fulfill all of the aspects of IBD's [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) seven-point investment system.


Not all sectors are participating in the January rally. The Dow utility average followed Tuesday's 1.1% drop with a 1.3% slide, even though interest rates moved little in the U.S. Treasury bond markets. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note edged lower to 2.44%.


Utility stocks were not the only defensive type of companies that fell hard on Wednesday. Gold mining, dairy product, grain and hospital groups all joined the 10 worst industries, losing more than 1% each.


One may be genuinely concerned about the persistently high level of enthusiasm among investors. The latest Investors Intelligence survey shows that bullishness among newsletter writers fell to 61.9% but remains close to the 30-year high of 64.4%, reached in November 2017. It's the 12th consecutive week in which the bulls ratio remained above the "danger zone" of 60% or higher. Bearishness remains ultra low at 15.2%.


For sure, the biggest stock market runs begin at the bottom, and usually when bearishness exceeds bullishness. At the same time, one cannot simply sell stocks based on an individual opinion. Let the market's action be your guide. Bull markets don't die of old age. They end when the institutions get afraid of the future and sell with abandon.


If distribution days start to bunch up again and the declines are severe, you should see both leading stocks and possibly the ones in your own portfolio diving hard. So far in 2018, that's not been the case.


If breakouts fizzle and sell signals get triggered, that would be another good reason to lighten up on stocks. But the underlying message given by names in the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders and other screens still seems to be one of strength.

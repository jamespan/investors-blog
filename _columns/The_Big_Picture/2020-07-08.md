The Nasdaq composite countered Tuesday's downside reversal and outside day with a bullish gain and inside day on Wednesday. Top-rated growth stocks turned in another day of outperformance.




A wave of selling hit the stock market around 11 a.m. ET. The Nasdaq composite more than halved a 1.3% intraday gain and a 0.8% gain for the S&P 500 faded to a small loss. But indexes found their footing and closed near session highs. [FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) hit all-time highs.


The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising 1.4%. The S&P 500 rallied 0.8% and is still in position for a breakout as it sits just below its recent high of 3233. The Dow Jones industrials picked up 0.7%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.8%. Nasdaq volume fell a bit from Tuesday's level. NYSE volume appeared to rise slightly.


On the NYSE and Nasdaq, advancing stocks beat decliners by a 7-5 ratio.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index performed mostly in-line with the Nasdaq. Data center chip leader **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) is near the top of a short cup base with a 127.89 buy point. **Marvell Technology Group** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)), meanwhile, cleared a short consolidation with a 37.01 entry.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 flashed outside days (when the day's price range engulfs the prior day's) Tuesday. But both indexes avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) because volume fell from Monday's levels. The Nasdaq's [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) on June 19 was removed from the Nasdaq's distribution-day count on Monday, bringing its count to zero. The S&P 500 currently shows four distribution days, but only one day had the feeling of intense institutional selling. That was on June 24 when the index plunged 2.6% in higher volume.


Meanwhile, the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly in states like California, Texas and Florida, according to [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). California reported 8,631 cases Tuesday, just below a record high of 9,439 on July 2. Texas reported a record 9,414 cases on Tuesday. New cases in Florida were close to 10,000 as of 3:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, well above Tuesday's total of 7,347.


But the stock market is still confident about an economic recovery for the U.S. despite the pandemic.


Homebuilders were a bright spot Wednesday on news mortgage applications soared 33% year over year. IBD's homebuilder group jumped 3%, helped by a bullish breakout for **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), one of the top-rated stocks in the group. It cleared a 79.36 buy point, rising nearly 7% to 82.20. Group peer **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Tuesday when it cleared a 95.34 buy point. It followed through nicely Wednesday, rising another 5% to 102.73.


Bullish Sentiment Rises
-----------------------


The latest weekly Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a rise in bullish sentiment. The bulls rose to 57.7%, the highest since mid-January, when it hit 59.4%. One month later, the stock market started a sharp pullback. Bullish sentiment hit 61.8% in September 2018 just ahead of market pullback in early October. The survey is a contrarian indicator. According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% call for defensive measure in the form of tight stops or trimming positions in big winners. Bulls around 60% call for even more caution.


Another reason for caution is that the Nasdaq 100 is near the top of an upper channel line. Using a daily chart of the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), start the channel line at the fund's April 17 high and connect its subsequent highs. When a stock or an index moves above an upper channel, it's a sign that the stock or index is overheating and could be ready for a pullback.


Another sign that the Nasdaq could be ready to pause is where the index is in relation to its 200-day moving average. As noted in [Tuesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-ends-win-streak-leading-stocks-outperform/), the Nasdaq was 20% above its 200-day moving average at Tuesday's high. That's the largest gap in at least eight years. At the February peak, the Nasdaq got as much as 18% above its 200-day average.



Despite some yellow flags, the action in market-leading growth stocks has been superb, and it was more of the same Wednesday. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed again, rising 2%.


Leaderboard stocks performed even better, up a collective 3.3%. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), which joined Leaderboard on Monday when it gapped over a 231.13 handle entry, hit an all-time high. Shares soared 9% to 257.68. Security software firm **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) broke out over a trend line, rising 6% to 146.35. It's near the top of an eight-week consolidation with a buy point of 149.79.

The Big Picture: Stocks Mixed As India Plays Protectionist Card
================================================================

Stocks showed constructive action Friday, even as the major indexes delivered a lackluster day.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.3%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1%. The Nasdaq trimmed 0.2%, partly because of losses in the index's biggest weightings.


Volume fell across the board.


The Jan. 14 distribution day fell off the S&P 500 because of price gains since that day.

For instance, the weakest groups of the day included food, tobacco and department stores, all either drab or defensive plays.


No self-respecting growth investor would be caught pinning his or her hopes on conservative groups.


Breakouts Popping Up
--------------------


Although the stock market began the current rally with a dearth of breakouts, stocks are making up for lost ground now.


On Friday, breakouts included footwear firm **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), up 10%, and investment banker **LPL Financial** ([LPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPLA)), up 7%. Medical research outsourcing company **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), up 2%, cleared an alternative entry. It had already topped a 62.23 buy point earlier.


Other stocks that broke out during the week included business software developer **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), customer contact software firm **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)), and three aerospace-tied firms: **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) and **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)).


Note that most of these breakouts are emerging from strong industry groups, a factor that could provide a tailwind.


India Protectionism Hits Amazon, Walmart
----------------------------------------


In the meantime, the action of two stocks weighed on the Nasdaq. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) fell about 1.5%; and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), 5.5%. The two together account for 12.5% of the Nasdaq's weighting.


A [number of analysts made cautious comments](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-earnings/) on the company's outlook following Amazon's earnings report late Thursday, including some who cited the company's new problems in India.


Both Amazon and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) ran into a headwind Friday as India implemented protectionist measures. The moves forced Amazon and Walmart to pull items from their online sites.


This underlines the difficulties of containing a trade war once it begins.


The U.S. and China concluded trade talks Friday as President Trump claimed "tremendous progress." The two countries face an early March deadline to avoid a U.S. hike in tariffs.


In the coming week, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will be closed Monday through Friday. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be shut Tuesday through Thursday.

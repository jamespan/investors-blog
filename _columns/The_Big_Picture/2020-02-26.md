The stock market opened with a bang but faded to a whimper Wednesday.




With the stock market in a correction, the price action wasn't all that surprising. Strong opens and weak closes are typical in a market where institutional investors are selling stocks. And the big guns have been doing a lot of it lately.


The first day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite was far from impressive. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2%, but the gain faded to 0.2% by the close. After falling below its 200-day moving average Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended losses, falling nearly 0.5%. The S&P 500 gave back 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index dived 1.2%.


After a two-session drop of 7.8%, the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell an additional 2.2%. After the close Wednesday, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, was off 0.7%. Microsoft said late that [it will miss some sales forecasts](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-update-on-q3-fy20-guidance-301012053.html) because of problems with its supply chain in China.


As long as the Nasdaq holds above Wednesday's low, its rally attempt will still be intact. Nasdaq volume fell slightly, but trade rose modestly on the NYSE.

U.S. health officials on Tuesday said it's likely the coronavirus will start spreading in the U.S. A 15th case having originated in the U.S. was confirmed Wednesday, bringing the total number of confirmed U.S. cases to 60. Forty-five cases in the U.S. are from people evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan or from Wuhan, China. New cases are slowing in China, but expanding in South Korea, Italy and Iran.


Biotech **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), after surging nearly 28% on Tuesday, rose 23% Wednesday after the company reported earnings and said it shipped its first coronavirus vaccine to the National Institutes of Health for clinical trials.


Stock Market Leaders
--------------------


After four straight [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the Nasdaq composite Thursday to Tuesday, institutional selling could take a while to run its course. Stock market leaders like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) look like they're ready to start new bases.


It's easy to stop paying attention when the market's acting weak, but it's really the time to be keeping track of the strongest stocks. It's these stocks that can be the first out of the gate when the stock market goes back into a confirmed uptrend. And there's a pretty good crop of them currently.



**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) is making a solid first test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) after a bullish earnings report last month. **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) is also acting well after a recent breakout.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) are currently testing their 10-week lines, but support is still in question with no conviction bounce yet.


After four straight low-volume declines, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) continues to hold near highs. The streaming giant reclaimed a 338.10 buy point on Jan. 23, but it's still trying to break out from a giant cup base that started in May.


Bond Market
-----------


After hitting a record low Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield lost another 2 basis points to 1.34%. Bond yields have plummeted on fears the coronavirus outbreak will fuel a global growth slowdown. As a result, the chances for another rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year have increased dramatically.


The stock market shrugged off bullish new-home sales data for January. Instead, it focused on an earnings and sales miss at **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), which dragged [housing stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/homebuilder-stocks-to-watch-and-housing-market-real-estate-news/) lower. Toll Brothers gapped below its 200-day moving average, falling 14.6%. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) fell 2.7% after shedding 4% Tuesday.


Psychological Market Indicators
-------------------------------


Perhaps the most interesting data point Wednesday was the latest survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence, It revealed a drop in bullish sentiment to 49.1% from 54.7%. Excessively bullish sentiment of 60% or more has come ahead of market pullbacks in the past. But sentiment certainly isn't bullish now, although not excessively bearish either. The survey is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.

Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio is another contrarian indicator, and it's getting close to extreme levels. The ratio was 1.07 on Monday, 1.12 on Tuesday and 1.06 on Wednesday — still below the 1.15 or higher threshold that's been seen near market lows in the past.


Stock Market Earnings In Focus
------------------------------


Wall Street frowned on earnings reports Wednesday from **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) and **Virgin Galactic** ([SPCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPCE)), but it cheered strong results from retailer **TJX** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)). The stock surged to an all-time high, rising 7%.


**Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) had been holding up well ahead of earnings, but [shares crashed 12% in late trading after earnings missed expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/carvana-earnings-miss-estimates-as-stock-drops/).


After seven straight weekly price gains, **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) is down 8% so far this week. But Square stock popped more than 7% in after-hours trading on [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/square-earnings-sq-stock-q42019/).

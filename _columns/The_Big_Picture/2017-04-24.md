Stocks Surge On French Election; Volume So-So, But Breakouts Emerge
====================================================================

The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 gapped above their 50-day moving averages Monday and the Nasdaq scored an all-time closing high — good enough to put the market back in a confirmed uptrend, as Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief over France's presidential vote.


Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen are the two candidates left after Sunday's first round of voting and will have a runoff election May 7. The polls currently show Macron with a big lead over Le Pen, who is anti-immigrant and opposed to the European Union. World markets want France to stay in the EU, and it's looking more likely after Sunday's results.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, rising 1.3%; the Nasdaq composite rose 1.2%, while the Dow and S&P 500 rallied 1.1%.


The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) also had a solid showing, up 2%, helped by strength in chipmaker **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)), which cleared a 52.32 buy point in heavy volume. Shares rose 4%, to 54.01, ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close.


Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose slightly from Friday's levels. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by more than 2-to-1.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MP042417-185x300.png)The Nasdaq's March 17 stalling session fell off the distribution-day count due to time, but the count stays the same because a subsequent stalling day now goes into the count.


Despite the solid showing, the gains fell short of Europe's strong showing overnight that saw the Paris CAC 40 surge 4.1%. Germany's DAX added 3.4% while London's FTSE 100 climbed 2%.


A bad day for the stock market on March 21, when the Nasdaq plunged 1.8% in higher volume, put the market uptrend under pressure. But the Nasdaq was able to hold above its 50-day moving average, never moving far off its all-time high. With the market back in a confirmed uptrend, it's OK to put some money to work, but be disciplined if a trade doesn't go as planned. Avoid low-volume breakouts and make sure that buy candidates have a bullish relative strength line, at or near new highs along with the stock.


Financials were among the day's outperformers, particularly money centers and superregional banks. Many financials seemed to follow the lead of the 10-year Treasury yield, which rose 5 basis points early to 2.30% but faded to 2.27% in late-afternoon trading.


In the superregional banks, **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) jumped 2% to 89.38 as it works on a flat base with a 90.77 buy point. Other names in the group gapped above their 50-day lines but gave back early gains, including **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), **KeyCorp** ([KEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEY)), **Great Western Bank** ([GWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWB)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)).


Elsewhere, **East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) rose solidly for the fourth straight session after gapping above the 50-day moving average last week. Shares jumped 3.5% to 56. It's close to clearing a 57.07 buy point.


But the picture isn't so clear with several other financial names like **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), which all continue to trade below their 50-day lines.


Steel producers outperformed. The top-rated name in the group, **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), is back above its 50-day moving average after soaring 7.5% last week, helped by strong earnings.


The technology sector served up some breakouts. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)) added 1.76 to 66.18. It's still in buy range from its entry at 65.88.


**IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) cleared a 124.37 flat-base entry, rising 3% to 124.46.


IBD's software design group yielded a trio of breakouts. **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) rose 1.7% to 73.85, ending just above a 73.18 buy point; **Ansys** ([ANSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANSS)) added 1.5% to 109.60, closing just above a 109.02 buy point and **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) picked up 1.8% to 90.14, closing just above an 89.28 entry.


REITs, gold miners, department store operators and homebuilders lagged.

Bearish Action Builds As S&P Plunges More Than 2%; This Sentiment Gauge Could Signal Stock Market Low
======================================================================================================

Sellers came back from the weekend with a big appetite, sending the stock market indexes to a second straight day of sharp losses. After the two-session rout, investors have reason to make some defensive adjustments.




The Nasdaq composite, which sold off 2% on Friday, lost another 2.6%. The S&P 500 fell 2.1%, its largest single-day loss since June 16.


Both indexes slid below the [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) â€” the latest in a series of bearish signals.


Last week, the stock market [started showing signs of pulling back](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-signals-indicate-a-pause-nasdaq-small-caps-lead-losses/). Indexes fell below trend lines and the S&P 500 met resistance at its 200-day moving average.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9% on Monday. Small caps also saw heavy losses as the Russell 2000 sold off 2.1%. Innovator IBD 50 ETF fell a relatively mild 0.6%.

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose slightly on the NYSE, compared to Friday. That gave the S&P 500 a new distribution day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP_2x2_082222-240x300.jpg)Losses and doubts grew Monday as the uptrend from the mid-June lows suddenly turned lower. And there haven't been any places to break the fall so far.


But investor fear is ramping up to levels that could signal a low. The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) climbed 17.5% Monday, and is more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. A similar spike occurred just before the June 16 market low.


Just keep in mind it's been a false signal several other times this year.


Treasury Yields Rise, Hurt Stocks
---------------------------------


Rising yields are one reason the stock market is cooling off. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed nearly 5 basis points to 3.04% and is above the 3% mark for the first time since July 21.


Another signpost on monetary policy comes Friday, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. With little else to monitor until Friday's big event, the stock market could be volatile this week and later on, says Lindsey Bell, chief money & markets strategist for Ally Financial.


"There's not a lot of direction in the near-term," she said in a commentary. "Corporate earnings season is concluding, the month (and summer) are coming to an end, and news flow will slow. Investors are looking for a catalyst and without clear direction volatility is likely to increase."


The market, she added, will remain reactionary to important economic data and Fed decisions. "September is notoriously a tough month for stocks and it doesn't seem that will change this year. That said, the months following a midterm election have historically been very strong for the market."

Stock Market: What Investors Should Do Now
------------------------------------------


Investors should be taking some defensive measures.


[MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s list of recent breakouts now contains nearly 50 stocks, but most have little margin above buy points. Remember, many stocks test their buy points after breakouts, but be ready to sell any that [fall more than 7% or 8% below your entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Also [watch out for round trips](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/amazon-stock-amzn-triggered-key-profit-taking-rule-before-flashing-sell-signals/), where stocks erase gains of more than 10% from breakouts.


The energy sector remains a refuge for investors. While most S&P sector ETFs fell more than 1% Monday, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) lost only 0.2%.



Two of the 12 stocks in IBD's coal industry group made 52-week highs, while five pipeline stocks also hit new highs in today's stock market.


**Equinor** ([EQNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQNR)), part of the integrated oil & gas industry, broke out to new highs.


The Norway-based company topped a 39.25 buy point, although some chart readers would argue that EQNR stock also formed a double bottom with a 38.80 entry. Either way, it was one of the few bullish moves in Monday's stock market.


Energy markets face their own volatility as Russian supplies to Europe remain unsettled. The weekend assassination of the daughter of a close Vladimir Putin ally reignited geopolitical risk.


Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS, believes such events highlight "a growing shift toward an age of security, in which companies and government will focus more on security and safety relative to pure concerns of price and efficiency in a range of areas." Fears of a digital war give added impetus to cybersecurity spending, he added.

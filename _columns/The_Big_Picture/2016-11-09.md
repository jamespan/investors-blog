Late-night fears over the possibility of a Hillary Clinton defeat melted into strong cheers by investors as the stock market resumed its uptrend Wednesday.


Big gains across the board showed a market sensing the possibility that a Donald Trump White House could lead to a new chapter of lower taxes, economic growth, more business innovation and renewed American optimism.


Stocks overcame huge losses in overnight market-index futures. The Dow Jones industrials plunged 800 points, or more than 4%, as it became more evident that Trump was on the verge of capturing the Oval Office.


But after the sun rose on Wednesday, the indexes opened with minor losses, then marched higher in lockstep in the regular session.


Despite losses in some big- and megacap techs, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 ended up 1.1%; the Nasdaq 100, composed of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in that exchange, edged up 0.4%.


![mp110916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110916-154x300.png)Leading stocks are acting pretty well. The Nasdaq, S&P 500, and even the Dow Jones industrials all rebounded back above their 50-day moving averages. Look at Dow components **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) (up 12.5% past a 65.08 cup with handle entry) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) (up 11.6% from a 172.52 buy point), as well as other big Wall Street banks, and you'll feel convinced that stocks are rising out of bottoming-style bases and have a better chance of running higher after breaking out.


These facts justify a change in the trend and give astute investors an opportunity to buy with higher probability of making money in growth stocks.


It also is the right time to refresh one's watch list of names with excellent fundamentals that are building sound bases. The "leaders up in volume" portion of the Market Pulse gives readers some ideas for a watch list.


Keep in mind that the Dow Jones industrials, which rallied 1.4%, is now back at a level where the market began to succumb to sustained selling pressure. And the [distribution-day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) count remains elevated.


The market moved into a confirmed uptrend after a rare Day 3 [follow-through](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735761&sourceid=735764) rally on June 30.


Wednesday's cheering was strongest among small-cap investors. The Russell 2000 paced the surprise turnaround rally, rising 3.1% -- enough for the index to post a follow-though of its own on the fourth day of a new rally attempt.


The Russell had fallen nearly 9% after making a peak of 1263 on Sept. 22. That's enough of a decline to have begun the search for a change in trend.


Meanwhile, big-cap stocks had eased much less in price over the past several weeks. Thus, IBD had held the outlook based on action by the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 at an uptrend under pressure, which doesn't necessarily depend on a brand-new follow-though to move back into confirmed uptrend status.


The Nasdaq now stands less than 2% below its all-time high of 5342.


Question marks abound over what the new president-elect will do regarding existing trade agreements, diplomatic relationships with economic and military superpowers, and illegal immigration. Yet for now, the market's internals showed multiple positives.


Winners trumped losers by more than a 5-to-2 ratio on the Nasdaq, and 6-to-5 on the NYSE. On Wednesday, new highs screened by IBD soared to a combined 385 issues on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, vs. 141 stocks hitting 52-week or all-time lows. Banks topped IBD's [new high list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-09-2016/) with 91 names; not surprisingly, S&Ls ranked 2nd at 14.


Fear of what Trump may do to slow down trade between the No. 1 economy in the world and its major partners seemed to dissipate as money flowed into sectors believed to benefit from a Trump administration eager to spend on infrastructure, protect U.S. manufacturing sectors, and not get in the way of medical innovation.


Sector rotation is a timeless theme in the market. Wednesday's action showed no exception to this rule.


Shares of steel, coal, biotech, aerospace and construction materials soared on Wednesday, more than offsetting losses in Democrat-supported industries such as solar and alternative energy.


All-electric vehicle pioneer **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), a huge winner after its April 2013 breakout, struggled on Wednesday with a 2.5% drop to 190.06. The large-cap auto and alternative energy play also probed new multimonth lows. It will take a lot of time, and perhaps a new string of quarters of excellent earnings, before the stock can re-enter the market leadership.


Breakouts gained more steam, although IBD's new-high list has remained narrow in recent days.
Companies posting solid Q3 results have been rewarded, such as **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) (extended after a strong bounce off the 50-day line), **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) (basing), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) (basing), **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) (breaking out past 22.25) and **Synchronoss Technologies** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)) (extended past a 43.75 bottoming-base buy point).


None of these five have a market value exceeding $5 billion, which is generally the minimum threshold for midcap status. But the average Q3 EPS increase among the five is an outstanding 74%.


Synchronoss posted just a 17% EPS gain, but growth at the transaction management expert is accelerating. Revenue grew 17% to $176.4 million, accelerating from gains of 7% and 14% in the prior two quarters. It earns a maximum 99 Composite Rating from [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-synchronoss-technologies-sncr.aspx) based on an analysis of company fundamentals, stock price action, relative strength and measures on the quality of institutional sponsorship.


Gold miners rallied, but none of the institutional-quality names is ready to break out. Considering that the U.S. economy is still growing and the labor markets are tightening, it's difficult to see gold and other "defensive" commodities rising as a safe haven from a potential recession.


In fact, grain, utility, alcoholic beverage and hospital stocks all fell hard. So did U.S. government bonds. The 10-year yield spiked more than 20 basis points to 2.07%, crossing the 2% barrier for the first time since January. Tradeweb noted the one-day gain in yield as the highest ever since the 10-year note began trading on the alternative exchange in November 2007.


Recessions ultimately kill bull markets. Would Trump, upon his inauguration, take drastic measures to hurt the global economy? It's highly unlikely, given that he's got an impressive list of economic advisors, including Peter Navarro, oil billionaire Harold Hamm and hedge fund maven John Paulson.


The possibility of business and worker-friendly tax reform, including a sharp cut in the marginal corporate tax rate, in addition to the closing of oft-abused loopholes benefiting mainly the ultrawealthy, perhaps may serve as an antidote to more than six years of stagnant U.S. economic growth and wage gains.


Corporations and small businesses might now be in line for badly needed tax relief after Trump's election.


Real-estate-magnate-turned-president-elect Trump has promised across-the-board tax cuts for businesses by slashing the top marginal tax rate from the current 35% to 15% -- which would take the U.S. from having the highest tax rate on corporations in the OECD, to one of the lowest.


What's more, with an estimated $2 trillion in foreign profits by U.S. companies remaining parked in overseas accounts, Trump has said he'll levy a one-time tax of just 10% on those that repatriate their foreign profits. That would potentially create a huge windfall of capital to add a significant kick to U.S. business investment.


And he'll let companies expense capital investments, so they'll be able to write off big investments much quicker.


Taken together, these moves will lead to a jump in business investment and job creation, economists and investment managers say — and may help propel the economy forward. Even foreign investors are taking note.


"Mr. Trump has also been bold on promising tax cuts for high net worth individuals and corporations in the hope of attracting investment, jobs and talent," said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a global financial advisory firm.


"With all of this in mind, it can be expected that investors in the U.S. and around the world will be now urgently reviewing and rebalancing their portfolios and personal financial strategies, in order to take full financial advantage of the surprise Trump victory."

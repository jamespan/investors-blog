The bulls got some relief Monday as a flurry of buying late in Monday's session lifted major averages to session highs. The Dow Jones industrial average fared the best, rising 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Nasdaq rallied 0.4%. Volume rose from Friday's elevated levels, an impressive accumulation day after Friday's drubbing.


Volume picked up in the last half hour of trading, but overall breadth left a lot to be desired. NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1. On the Nasdaq, losers topped winners by less than 2-to-1.

The market's message has been pretty clear in recent days: As oil prices go, so goes the market.


Crude oil fell below the $35-a-barrel level for the first time since February 2009 but recovered, rising 69 cents, or 1.9% to $36.31 a barrel. While rising oil prices signify strong demand and a healthy economy, falling oil prices mean just the opposite, and that's been causing the market consternation in recent days. Most of this year's slump in oil prices had been due to oversupply.


IBD's market outlook was lowered Friday to market in correction after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped below their 50-day moving averages in higher volume. The market was certainly teetering ahead of Friday's sell-off. Distribution days were started to cluster, with the Nasdaq showing five higher-volume declines since Dec. 2.


Now is not the time to be looking for breakouts to buy. Aggressive investors might nibble at a name or two here and there, but experienced growth investors will generally keep their powder dry, waiting patiently for confirmation of a new uptrend. Monday's gains were encouraging, but they don't mean much in light of repeated signs of distribution in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The two-day Fed meeting starts Tuesday and a decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Late Monday, fed funds futures traders pegged the odds of a rate hike at 83%, according to CME Group FedWatch.


From a technical perspective, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are showing signs of wear and tear, but the bulls can hang their hat on the fact that Nasdaq 100 heavyweights like **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) look just fine. So far, all four are enjoying successful tests of their 10-week moving averages for the first time after recent breakouts.

Major stock indexes were mixed and mostly unchanged for a good portion of Tuesday's session, but sellers came into the market during the last hour of trading. The Dow and Russell 2000 took the hardest hits, falling 0.7% each.




Wall Street's nerves were rattled after President Trump cast doubt on his June summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. He also said he's not happy with trade talks with China so far, and that no deal has been reached to save Chinese telecom **ZTE Corp**.


Higher-priced names took the most heat in the Dow. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) fared the worst, falling 2.5%. Shares of Boeing and many other stocks gapped up Monday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a trade war with China is on hold.


JPMorgan Leads Dow
------------------


**JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) outperformed in the Dow, rising 0.8%. It reclaimed the 50-day moving average May 9 and is holding above the line as it works on a flat base. Financials were generally strong ahead of a Republican-controlled House vote on changes to the Dodd-Frank law. The banking bill is widely expected to pass after working its way through the Senate in March.

Regional banks also performed well Tuesday as the 10-year Treasury yield ended flat around 3.06%. The outright leader in the group is [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)) but it's well-extended past a proper buy point. Still, the group is home to an actionable name and some potentially actionable ones.


**BB&T Corp**. ([BBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBT)) added 1% to 55.53. It's still in buy range from a 54.80 buy point. **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) rose 1.5% to 100.29. It's working on a flat base with a 102.76 buy point. **Regions Financial** ([RF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RF)) and **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) are also approaching flat-base buy points.


The S&P 500 lost 0.3% and Nasdaq composite gave back 0.2%. Earlier in the session, the Russell 2000 was poised for its fifth straight all-time closing high, but it reversed lower.


Volume on the Nasdaq came in slightly lower than Monday. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Monday.


Indexes In Confirmed Uptrend
----------------------------


When it comes to overall market health, a confirmed uptrend remains in place until proven otherwise. The Dow continues to grapple with the 25,000 level after closing just above it Monday. For the Nasdaq, the 7500 level is a potential resistance level to watch. The blue-chip index is still above the 50-day moving average, along with the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


The [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count is contained on the Nasdaq, but it's a bit more daunting on the S&P 500. Headed into Tuesday, out of the S&P 500's six distribution days, five showed declines ranging from 0.7% to 1.3%.


Still, the action in leading growth stocks still looks OK, with plenty of sound charts. IBD 50 name **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) jumped 6% as it works on the right side of a base. Aggressive buyers may have nibbled when the stock cleared an early entry of 54.37, but an alternate entry could still appear. The company on Monday raised its earnings and sales guidance for the current quarter and announced a $10 billion share buyback.



Other IBD 50 names continue to hold gains smartly after recently breakouts, including **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), among others.


Retail stocks garnered more headlines Tuesday. A strong premarket gain for **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) faded badly. Shares cratered 7.5% despite better-than-expected earnings, sales and same-store sales growth in the quarter. The problem was [same-store sales guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/kohls-q1-earnings-macys-jcpenney-department-store-results/).


Meanwhile, department store operator **J.C. Penney** ([JCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCP)) slumped nearly 7% after CEO Marvin Ellison resigned to take the CEO post at home-improvement retailer **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)).


**TJX Cos**. ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) was a bright spot in retail, rising 3% on strong results. A buy point of 84.89 is still in play for the stock.


Homebuilders were weak again, weighed down by weak earnings from **Toll Bros**. ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) Shares crashed 8%. It was noted as a possible put-option trade in last week's [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/ross-stores-kohls-best-buy-headline-busy-week-of-retail-earnings/) column.

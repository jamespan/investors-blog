=========================================================================

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reversed higher Friday and the Nasdaq pared losses, as the major stock indexes shrugged off China Evergrande tensions and Bitcoin's tumble. Top growth stocks Costco, Salesforce.com, Snap and Tesla traded in new buy zones as the market sought to build on its bounce.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The stock market got off to a weak start Friday, as China Evergrande Group missed a key interest payment. Evergrande let a Thursday deadline pass to pay a $83.5 million coupon payment on its U.S. dollar bonds without notifying bondholders. Despite missing the payment deadline, the company has a 30-day grace period before the bondholders can signal a default. The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-makes-preparations-for-evergrandes-demise-11632391852?mod=hp_lead_pos1) reported Thursday that China is asking local governments to prepare for the potential failure of the property developer.


Meanwhile, China's central bank cracked down on cryptocurrencies, saying all cryptocurrency transactions are illegal, sparking a 4.6% retreat in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)). Bitcoin slid to around $42,500 late Friday, according to [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092421-277x300.jpg)The tech-heavy Nasdaq inched lower but had been down as much as 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose 0.1% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.5%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 decisively regained their 50-day moving averages Thursday, while the Dow logged its third straight gain Friday. The blue-chip index remains below its 50-day line. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE compared with Thursday's numbers.


On the downside, leading growth stocks sharply underperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 1.4%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) tumbled 9%, triggering [the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 444.58 flat-base buy point. Footwear stocks were hurt Friday after **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) [missed sales estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-nike-earnings-supply-crunch/) and cut its guidance due to supply chain issues.

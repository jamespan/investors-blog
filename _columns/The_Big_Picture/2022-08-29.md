  Indexes Face Critical Test At These Levels; Energy Stocks Buck Downtrend

The stock market's nearly two-week slide has come down to an important test as major indexes fall to significant chart levels.




The Nasdaq composite closed 1% lower on Monday, making it a 10-day, 8.5% retreat. Notably, the Nasdaq arrested its drop at the 50-day moving average.


That offers the index a chance for a rebound. Perhaps not coincidentally, the 50-day average happens to be near the 12,000 level, a rough dividing line between support and resistance for several months.


But this has been a rapid drop to the line.


A 6% cushion above it vanished in the Nasdaq's past two sessions. A break below the line would bring another — perhaps worse — bearish sign. Thus, how the indexes behave around the 50-day line this week has keen importance.


The S&P 500 still has a bit of space above its 50-day line. It fell 0.7% Monday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is also testing the 50-day average, lost 0.6%. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), an ETF that carries most of the Nasdaq's weight, is sitting at its 50-day as well.

The low participation prevented the stock market from chalking up another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Fed Policy Hits Stocks
----------------------


In a sense, Monday's session was an extension of Friday's rout, albeit not as severe.


The Nasdaq plunged nearly 4% into the weekend while the S&P 500 lost more than 3%. Losses of more than 3% in the S&P are rare, although they've occurred seven times already this year.


Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research said the market's performance following this year's big sell-offs, on balance, "says not to expect much of a near-term bounce back from Friday's rout. In fact, one could justify being quite cautious here."


The stock market was left shaken Friday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that [even higher interest rates will be needed](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chair-powells-speech-the-two-words-that-could-upend-the-sp-500/) to extinguish the hottest inflation flare-up in four decades.


The Fed gets its next chance to boost the fed funds rate Sept. 21-22, and traders are betting heavily on another 75-basis-point hike. Those odds rose to nearly 75% on Monday, while the chances of a 50-basis-point increase stood at about 25%, according to [CME Group's FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html).


Treasury Yield Up 11 Basis Points
---------------------------------


Backing those expectations, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note added eight basis points to 3.11% to start the new week.


No doubt, the market figures to be sensitive to comments from Fed officials and [economic data](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). Tuesday morning, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index and the Labor Department's job openings survey are due out.


Thursday, the stock market gets two reports on the manufacturing sector and the jobless claims.


Friday marks the week's biggest event when the August jobs report comes out. Economists expect an increase of 293,000 nonfarm jobs, down from July's blowout 528,000 gain.


IBD 50 Holds Up Better Than Stock Market
----------------------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.3%, though it would have been a bigger loss had it not been for oil and gas outperformers. Fertilizer and chip component sell-offs weighed on the IBD 50 list.


By sector, energy continued to outperform.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 1.5%. Oil and gas comprised nine of the top 13 industry groups on Monday, booking gains of 0.7% to 4%. With some breakouts and bases appearing in the sector, investors have some opportunities to ponder.


A number of economically sensitive groups landed at the bottom of the performance table. This laggard's list included department stores, leisure products, trucking, shipping and semiconductors.

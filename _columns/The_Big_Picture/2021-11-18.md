The stock market finished mostly higher Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed in on fresh record highs. After a tech-driven rally, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) are in new buy zones.




Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 outperformed Thursday, rallying 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%, weighed down by a 5.5% tumble in shares of **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) that followed the [company's disappointing earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-stock-tumbles-as-quarterly-revenue-misses-guidance-disappoints/). The small-cap Russell 2000 slid 0.6%, as more speculative stocks were spurned in favor of large-cap stocks.


Leading growth stocks climbed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) moved up 0.8%, recovering a part of Wednesday's 1.25% slide. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) raced nearly 5% higher. Shares are about 80% above a 111.84 buy point in a cup with handle after an Aug. 11 breakout.


Chip stocks were firm, with the Vaneck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) up 2.5%, propelled higher by **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) 8.25% surge. Chip giant Nvidia [beat analyst estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-chipmaker-beats-third-quarter-sales-earnings-goals/) for its third quarter due to strong data-center processor sales.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP111821-230x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


What To Do Now
--------------


The stock market put in a mostly positive performance Thursday. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 reversed from early losses to close just shy of all-time highs. The Dow Jones industrials and small-cap Russell 2000 fell for a second straight day.


Amid the recent strength, the Nasdaq only has one [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower volume during the recent declines. The S&P 500's count remains at three distribution days. That's a low amount of institutional selling.

With the stock market once again approaching new highs, investors have good cause to remain upbeat about the health of the uptrend. So, breakouts in top growth stocks remain fair game. However, there was evidence of rotation out of high-flying speculative names and into large-cap technology stocks, like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), Amazon and Apple.



EV Stocks Crumble, But Not Tesla
--------------------------------


Stock market leader **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) avoided the prevailing weakness in electric-vehicle stocks, moving up 0.7% and extending a win streak to three sessions.


**Fisker** ([FSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSR)) tumbled 6.2%, triggering the [round-trip sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-winning-stock-plummets-round-trip-sell-rule/) from a 20.71 buy point in a cup base. Shares closed about 5% below the entry.


**Lucid Motors** ([LCID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCID)) lost 10.5%, adding to Wednesday's 5.35% decline. Despite the two days of sharp losses, [LCID stock](https://www.investors.com/research/lucid-motors-stock-buy-now/) remains far extended past a 28.49 buy point in a [cup-with-handle base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/)


**Rivian** ([RIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIVN)) dived 15.5%, closing 31% off Tuesday's high. Remember that investors should be disciplined about buying new issues by waiting for an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) to form before considering a purchase. The recent weakness could be the start of its first base formation, but this week's price action is not constructive given the huge downside reversal and high volatility.


Meanwhile, Chinese EV stocks **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) and **Xpeng Motors** ([XPEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XPEV)) slid 3.7% and 2.1%, respectively. Li Auto continues to build a cup with handle that shows a 34.93 buy point. Xpeng is now below the 48.08 buy point of a choppy cup base.

Adobe, Amazon, Apple In Buy Areas
---------------------------------


While many top growth stocks are extended, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), Amazon and Apple offer new buying opportunities.


[IBD Leaderboard](http://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) stock Adobe remains in the 5% buy area above a 659.29 buy point in a cup with handle following a Nov. 4 breakout move, as shares inched higher Thursday. The 5% buy zone goes up to 692.25.


Amazon broke out past a 3,605.55 buy point in a cup with handle, rallying over 4% Thursday. The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows that [AMZN stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) has a mediocre 82 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).


The stock's relative strength line is coming sharply off recent lows after November's gains, but it is well below its July high. That indicates underperformance vs. the S&P 500 over a longer time frame. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter to confirm the stock as a market leader.


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Apple is in buy range past a cup with handle's 153.27 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis, following Wednesday's breakout. Shares traded up nearly 3% Thursday following a [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle) that the company is pushing to debut a fully-autonomous Apple car as early as 2025.

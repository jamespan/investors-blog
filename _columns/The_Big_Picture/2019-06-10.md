  Four Reasons To Be Cautious With Growth Stocks Despite Bullish Stock Market Signal

Fresh from a bullish signal, the stock market extended its big rebound Monday, but indexes and many leading stocks trimmed gains.




The Nasdaq composite added 1%, basically cutting in half the day's gain. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3%. Last week's gains ended a six-week losing streak in the Dow, its longest since the middle part of 2011.


Software, semiconductor and other technology stocks led the market. **Salesforce.com**'s ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) [deal to acquire analytics firm](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-buys-tableau-software/) and sector laggard **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) for $15.7 billion in stock gave enterprise software shares an additional burst.


On Friday, the Nasdaq made a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), a signal for investors to increase exposure to stocks. While Monday's gains helped reinforce that bullish move, there are reasons to remain guarded.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MP061019-256x300.jpg)First, as follow-through days go, Friday's was a close call. True, the Nasdaq surged 1.7%, far more than necessary for a rally confirmation. But volume was only 3.4 million shares higher than on Thursday. Nasdaq volume fell slightly Monday; that's not a convincing rush of buyers.


Second, the market's correction in May came with a sharp break below the indexes' 50-day moving averages. Such "vertical violations," as we call them, are signs that we're dealing with more than a garden-variety pullback.


In these cases, the first or second follow-through may not work. Just last year, a pair of follow-through days on Nov. 7 and Nov. 28, both of which looked better than Friday's, failed quickly. A lasting follow-through didn't come until [Jan. 4 of this year on the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/).


Third, the Nasdaq rose past its 50-day moving average Monday, but closed below it. [IBD daily charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) draw the 50-day line in red. Continued upside resistance at this key level would be a third reason to hold off before committing more capital to the new uptrend.


Indeed, the 50-day line is the next level to watch as the market tries to solidify its advance. On the positive side, the S&P 500 closed above its 50-day line for a second day in row.


Small cap indexes, such as the Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600, still have quite a way to go before they challenge resistance a their respective 50-day moving averages.


A fourth risk is President Trump's trade battles, as [Friday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-posts-big-gains-ushers-in-positive-signal/) noted.


Stock Market Cheers Mexico Deal
-------------------------------


Over the weekend, the Trump administration evidently became satisfied with Mexico's proposals to help slow the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S. That halted tariffs on Mexican imports. With the threat gone, trucking, logistics and other transportation industry groups were leaders Monday. The Mexican peso rose more than 2%, and the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores climbed more than 1%.


But the bigger trade battle with China continues without any resolution in sight. A negative headline could spark selling again. That's a fourth reason to buy into the new uptrend carefully.


The stock market — which has been rallying on indications of an interest-rate cut — could turn sharply with bad news on China.


There are some positive signs working in the market's favor. Leading stocks are participating, with several breaking out the past few days. Even before Friday's surge, some breakouts planted the seeds of a new uptrend.


Last week the IBD 50 surged 4.5%, outperforming the Nasdaq (up 3.9%), S&P 500 (4.4%) and Russell 2000 (3.3%). On Monday, the IBD 50 rose 1.1%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) jumped 1%. FFTY is managed by [Innovator Capital](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty).


Market Leaders And Breakouts To Watch
-------------------------------------


Many leaders closed well off session highs Monday, including some breakouts.


**Upland Software** ([UPLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPLD)) kept more than half its gain, closing in buy range from the 50.74 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of an [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/). Volume expanded more than three times its 50-day average level. The stock was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Monday.


**Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)) and **Generac Holdings** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) held most of their gains. Penumbra, which is today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/penumbra-stock-running-spree-medical-devices/), topped a 162.60 buy point. Volume was mediocre, though. Generac surged past a 60.79 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in nearly 3 1/2-times its usual volume.

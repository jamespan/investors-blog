Stock Market Rises, After Head Fake Fools The Bears
====================================================

Stock indexes staged a remarkable U-turn Thursday, starting off with sizable losses and then erasing them all. The indexes also finished near their highs for the day, a bullish sign.




The Nasdaq gripped a 0.4% gain at the close after being down 1.1% early. Blue chips in the Dow Jones rose 0.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%. Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also advanced 0.5%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


After a nice spurt over the first six sessions of 2019, some kind of pullback seemed likely in the seventh session.

The lack of strong volume suggested that most institutions weren't looking for an opportunity to sell.


Head Fake
---------


Yet, the bulls got more than they might've reasonably expected Thursday. The roughly 1% drop in the major indexes turned out to be a head fake.


This time it was the bears who got caught leaning the wrong way.


The inability of the bearish camp to keep the indexes in the red was good news to optimists.


Optimism has been lacking since the sell-off from Oct. 1 through Christmas Eve.


Looking Stronger
----------------


Although the pessimists could yet grab back control of the stock market, the [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) Friday is looking stronger day by day.


So far, the strength is mostly seen in the performance of the stock indexes. Individual stocks have not stood out much. Breakouts have been isolated.


Three recent breakouts include business software designer **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), which is up 6% from the buy point; advertising services provider **QuinStreet** ([QNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QNST)), up 3%; and contract manufacturing company **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)), up 2%.


A Tip For This Stock Market
---------------------------


Here's a tip for those looking for watch-list candidates: Look for double-bottom bases. The W-shaped bases are naturally closer to a buy point than entries based on the left-side high. The double bottoms might break out first.


Perhaps, though, the dearth of breakouts is to be expected.


Given the depth of the correction — about 24% in the Nasdaq and just over 20% on the S&P 500 — bases may take some time to get within striking distance of a buy point.


The timing, though, could prove advantageous.


Earnings Season
---------------


Q4 earnings season will pick up in the weeks ahead, and companies not reporting for several weeks could give bases time to form. Earnings season also could give investors something to focus on other than news.


Expectations surrounding earnings season are mostly dim, which could set some stocks up for positive surprises. Clearly this is not a market priced for perfection. There's plenty of headroom if companies can deliver.


China trade issues, the Federal Reserve and the government shutdown are likely to flare up on occasion. But these items are not new.


A Calm Fed Chief Speaks
-----------------------


Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday to the Economic Club in Washington, D.C. Remarks from Powell were reassuring, and the market did not react much. Powell painted a positive picture of the U.S. economy but hinted at a willingness to change if conditions change.


If and when those issues are resolved – especially China and the Fed – the stock market could benefit.


Powell did say the Fed will [continue to reduce its balance sheet](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-balance-sheet/), noting that he expects it to become "substantially smaller."

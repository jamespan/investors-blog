Stocks scored big gains Monday, marking some positive action after two weeks of losses.


The S&P 500 jumped 1.4%, closing back above its 50-day moving average. It also recouped all of last week's loss, and then some.


The Nasdaq ran 1.2% higher. It too wiped out all of its loss from the past week.


Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 scored their biggest gains of the month so far. The move followed Friday's high put-call ratio of 1.16. Such spikes have resulted in short-term bounces in the indexes over the past year or so.


The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 1.3%. But the small-cap Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.6% rise. Small caps had shown relative strength during last week's market weakness, which made for a curious divergence.


The IBD 50 vaulted 2.3%


Monday's catalysts included a retreat in the surging dollar. But crude oil settled at a six-year low.


The market also digested a round of weaker-than-expected factory and housing data (see story [here](http://news.investors.com/economy/031615-743642-slowing-industrial-output-suggests-no-momentum-economy.htm)), which came out ahead of a two-day Fed meeting that starts Tuesday.


Despite the solid gains in the main indexes, volume fell across the board from Friday's pace. Gains in higher volume have been rare in recent weeks.


Trading may have slowed as investors await signals from Fed policymakers on just when interest rates will start rising.


Winners beat losers by nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE and about 5-to-4 on the Nasdaq.


The Feb. 6 distribution day on the S&P 500 fell off the count due to time: A distribution day is no longer valid after 25 sessions. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq still have five marks of institutional selling each, which is still on the high side. So the market's uptrend remains under pressure, which means investors should remain cautious.


It's also important to note that recent distribution days have taken place close to each other, which is not a good thing. It's like a boxer getting tagged with more-damaging combinations instead of just single shots.


Medical stocks, which have already been leaders for some time, showed healthy action Monday. **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), typically not a fast mover, bolted out from a flat base on news over the weekend of positive results from a couple of studies.


**Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) rose on news of a sweetened offer from **Valeant Pharmaceutiâ€”cals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)). **Endo International** ([ENDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENDP)), which jumped into the bidding for Salix last week, has withdrawn its offer.

U.S. stock indexes stayed on a routine path Thursday, chalking up small gains in quiet trade.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each stepped up 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1%. The small cap S&P 600 rose 0.7%, but the Dow Jones utility average surged 1.1%. The IBD 50 advanced 0.8%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


![MP081816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP081816-1.jpg)Modest price moves have been the trend for the indexes in this rally. In the 34 sessions after the June 30 follow-through day, the Nasdaq's daily gain has reached 1% or more only three times, while the S&P 500 did it just once.


No down day has reached the 1% level.


Still, the indexes suffered distribution Tuesday and stalling in the previous week. Distribution, which points to institutional selling, doesn't always arrive breaking glass and knocking over furniture. Sometimes it creeps in like a cat burglar.


For that reason, individual investors need to stay alert. Taking profits on the way up is much easier to do than on the way down, partly because a stock's unwinding often comes faster than the climb upward.


What if the stock keeps rising after an investor sells for a 20% to 25% gain? This really isn't a problem, unless greed overrides every other consideration.


If a stock keeps rising after the 20% to 25% gain, that might be a head's up to look for fresh potential winners.


In a good market, it's often easier to find a new stock that will gain 20%, than to wring an additional 20% out of a winning stock. Yet, the chart can sometimes prove helpful in deciding when to hold and when to fold.


Stocks that broke out and were fairly easy to hold as they rose include **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) and **B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)).



Each of these stocks kept going after reaching the 20% profit-taking level. The disciplined way the stocks rose added weight to the argument to hold. The 50-day line never got more serious than a brief test for these stocks.


News Thursday was mostly positive. First-time jobless claims were about 1% lighter than expected. The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook for August returned to positive territory, though that only matched views. Yet U.S. leading economic indicators for July came in at 0.4% -- twice the expected level and echoing the highest estimate in the range.


Friday is expected to be a light day for economic news. The only big item up is the Baker-Hughes oil rig count, according to Econoday.


After Thursday's close, **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) joined the midcap S&P 400. Dycom provides construction and engineering services to telecoms. **Patrick Industries** ([PATK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATK)) joined the small cap S&P 600. Patrick supplies the manufactured housing and RV firms with building products. Both stocks are highly rated.


Dycom rose 2.5% Thursday in fast trade. Patrick Industries popped 3% in heavy volume.

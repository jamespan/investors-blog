The stock market rallied for a second straight session in mildly higher volume Wednesday, good enough for the S&P 500 to notch a fresh all-time high.


The Nasdaq composite paced the day's quiet gains, up 0.4%. It's now a small advance away from painting a new 52-week high. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% ahead to keep its thin lead over the Nasdaq with a 7.5% year-to-date gain.


Credit the strength in biotech, and oil and gas exploration stocks for keeping the uptrend alive on Wednesday. Building, airline and auto retail names also rallied.


But the chip sector succumbed to heavy profit-taking, as semiconductor manufacturing, fabless design and chip equipment groups all fell hard. So did IBD's Computer-Networking, Telecom-Fiber Optics and Computer Software-Security groups.


No wonder the Nasdaq's market breadth was unimpressive, with losing stocks narrowly exceeding gainers.


On the NYSE, the technicals showed better health. As seen in the Dow industrials chart on this page, the NYSE advance-decline line bumped up as nearly 18 stocks rose for every 13 that fell.


The market's energy to hit new highs is encouraging. So are a number of leadership-quality stocks that have acted well since moving past proper buy points. **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) are up 25%, 15% and 5% from their recent proper entry points, respectively.


Stocks that are showing up in IBD's screens, including Sector Leaders (today on Page B1), the IPO Leaders (on Tuesday and Thursday), and the Stocks On The Move tables (Page B3) continue to be a great source of emerging new market leadership.


A trader's batting average, however, is probably a little lower today than when the market is in a more energetically bullish state. The bull run is certainly long in the tooth, and numerous stocks are in third- or fourth-stage bases, which boosts risk.


Given how the market has been cautiously treading into new highs in recent weeks and that the indexes are still saddled with a relatively beefy amount of distribution days, taking profits at 10% to 15% rather than 20% to 25% while cutting losses quickly is not a bad strategy. This is especially smart portfolio management if the breakout appears to show less punch than expected.


The S&P 500 is working on a sixth straight monthly gain and has rebounded 198% from the March 2009 low. Yet it still pays to seek out the companies that truly symbolize the N in CAN SLIM (see Tuesday's Investor's Corner on Page B3). Since early July, IBD New America has noted **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) (July 8), **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) (July 9), **Arris** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)) (July 10) and **Parsley Energy** ([PE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PE)) (July 17).

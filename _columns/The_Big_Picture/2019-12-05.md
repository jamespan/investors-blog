The stock market ended Thursday with minor gains amid a combination of trade optimism and impeachment news. Stocks opened higher on U.S.-China trade optimism, but quickly headed south after the U.S. House of Representatives moved to formally impeach President Trump. But indexes fought back in afternoon trade, ending slightly higher.




The Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a 0.1%, or 28-point, advance.


Strength in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) aided the Dow industrials. Apple gained 1.5% to move back within striking distance of its [20% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/), after a Citibank analysts raised his price target on Apple to 300 from 250. Nike stock broke out above an entry at 95.22 after a [Goldman Sachs upgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-enters-buy-zone-sharp-acceleration-of-growth/).

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP120519-261x300.jpg)After logging two [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) this week, the major stock indexes are trying to right themselves. Since the Monday-Tuesday slide, the market has been calmer, making narrower price moves.


Many leading stocks, like **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), remain comfortably above buy points, while stock market leaders — like graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — are holding on to their 50-day moving averages. If these levels give way, then more losses are likely.

Our index of leading growth stocks — the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) — gained 0.6%, easily beating the major indexes. [Innovator IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/ibd-indexes/ibd-etf-indexes-ibd-50-etf-leaders-breakout-stocks-etf-ffty-ldrs-bout/) ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) moved higher for a second straight day after a three-session pullback. The ETF of top growth stocks found support near its 50-day moving average Tuesday.


On the upside, retail leader and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) jumped more than 13% after reporting [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/rh-earnings-q3-2019-rh-stock-warren-buffett-bet/) after the market close Wednesday.


Meanwhile, Chinese e-commerce giant and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) idea **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) rallied 3% to close back at the 200 price level. Shares are extended beyond the [5% buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) of 184.23 and 188.38 buy points.

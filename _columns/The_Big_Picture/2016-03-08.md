For the long-only investor, no decline is pretty, especially when the major indexes fall at least 1% for the day.


Yet in light of the strong run in recent weeks, Tuesday's decline was perhaps as harmless as an investor could ask for.


The great majority of stocks on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE fell for the day. But growth stocks continued to form bases (see **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)), **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), **NVR Inc.** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **Cadence Design** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS))). Most breakouts held their ground. And the new high list continues to show that institutional money managers are looking not simply at yield and smashed-up commodity plays.


The Nasdaq composite fell 1.3%, and the S&P 500 slipped 1.1%, both finishing near the day's lows. The latter snapped a five-day win streak that sent the large-cap benchmark up 3.6%.


![MP030916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP030916-191x300.jpg)Small caps got hit harder. The Russell 2000 slumped 2.4%. At 1067.88, it's down 6% year-to-date. The S&P 500 is down a little more than 3%.


Volume fell on both main exchanges, a sign that not all fund managers were rushing for the exits. As seen in the Market Pulse, the distribution-day count remains low.


A pullback was likely due. In the prior three weeks, the Nasdaq chalked up gains of 3.9%, 1.9% and 2.8%. It's been an impressive comeback after the market sold off in late January to early February, taking out the Jan. 20 lows. So, it is encouraging to see Tuesday's declines absent the heavy turnover that investors have witnessed on days such as the first six trading days of 2016, as well as Feb. 2, Feb. 5 and Feb. 8, all of which were deep sell-offs in above-average trade.


The financial media immediately connected the sell-off in U.S. stocks to the surprise 25% drop in Chinese exports in February, reportedly the biggest year-over-year drop in six years.


Thing is, then, why did Chinese equity markets rally? The Shanghai composite reversed off its lows on Tuesday to finish up 0.1% for its sixth up day in a row. The Shenzhen composite, host to young technology stocks, also rose. One can dispute the coupling argument for U.S. and Chinese equities. The S&P MidCap 400 is down merely 1% since Jan. 1. The Shenzhen composite is down 24% year-to-date and has fallen 44% off its June 2015 peak of 3156.


In other words, Chinese stocks are still in a massive bear market. Their U.S. counterparts have fought to keep the hungry bear outdoors.


No doubt, as IBD coverage has shown in recent days, the market still shows a thick defensive stripe. It merely reflects a strong desire among stock investors for yield and businesses that are less prone to the vagaries of overseas markets. The Dow Jones utility average stood out Tuesday, rallying almost 1%. The **SPDR Utilities** ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ETF, formerly on [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), racked up a 52-week high Tuesday and is now up 10.5% year to date.


IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups still show a heaping spoonful of defensive names heading the list, from water supply (No. 2 in Tuesday's paper) to meat products (No. 5) to tobacco (No. 15). However, keep an eye on the electronics sector, which has quietly jumped into the top third of IBD's sector rankings in the stock tables, at No. 11. The sector is up 2% year-to-date and hosts at least 16 stocks, including **Proto Labs** ([PRLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRLB)), with a 90 [Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-proto-labs-inc-prlb.aspx) or higher.

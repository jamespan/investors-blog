 U.S. stocks pivoted twice Friday, staging a negative reversal to wipe out morning gains and then a positive reversal when House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled a vote on the health care bill.


The Nasdaq settled for a 0.2% gain. It was the second day in a row that it closed near session lows, and the composite's action Friday in higher volume amounted to stalling, a form of distribution. That added a sixth distribution day for the Nasdaq, which is getting high and supports the case for cautious investing.


The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.1%. The S&P 500 came close to touching its 50-day moving average, where a test of support looms.

For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1.2%. The S&P 500 checked in for a weekly loss of 1.4% and the Dow 1.5%.


Before Friday's open, economic data gave stocks a dose of optimism. Durable goods orders for February topped the consensus target of 1.5% with a 1.7% pop. Perhaps more importantly, the prior reading of 1.8% was revised upward to 2.3%.


Meanwhile, the Republican replacement for ObamaCare burned before it could rise off the House launchpad. President Trump told the Washington Post he was dropping the health care issue for the near future.


The market rose off its session lows on the news.


**HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)), a health savings account provider that would benefit from a more free-market approach to health care, slammed 5% lower Friday, bringing its loss for the week to 12.5%.


Blue chips were mostly down Friday, but some of the Dow components continue to sketch favorable charts. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) is trying to find support at its 50-day line. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) continues to work on a flat base. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) could be poised to clear a long cup-with-handle pattern.


The homebuilder group, an area of recent strength, was down 0.7% for the week, but some of the stocks are showing positive action.


Several homebuilders completed three-weeks-tight patterns Friday including **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)).


Others added handles, including **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **TRI Pointe Group** ([TPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPH)). A handle represents a final wave of selling by weak holders and can make a breakout more likely to work.


The Coming Week
---------------


The big test ahead will come Thursday, which will feature the final take on fourth-quarter GDP. The prior reading was 1.9%.


On Monday, the Dallas Fed will report its manufacturing survey.


Tuesday will include data on Case-Shiller home prices, The Conference Board's consumer confidence gauge and the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index.


Wednesday will offer reports on pending home sales and the Energy Information Administration's crude oil inventories.


In addition to the GDP number, Thursday will include first-time jobless claims and corporate profits.


Friday's lineup will include reports on personal income and outlays, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge and the Baker-Hughes oil rig count.

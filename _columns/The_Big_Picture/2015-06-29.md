Stocks started a short trading week with big losses Monday as the crisis in Greece escalated. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.4%, marking the biggest loss since a 3.1% drop on April 10, 2014. The index sliced its 50-day moving average and the 5000 level, which it had defended twice earlier this month.

  

The S&P 500 slumped 2.1 % for its fourth straight loss. It undercut prior lows near the 2100 level and turned a touch lower for the year. The index is nearing its 200-day moving average, where there's potential for support.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 2%, with all 30 of its components falling. Small caps took the biggest hit, as the Russell 2000 slid 2.6%, slicing its 50-day moving average.

  

Stock markets around the world sold off Monday as Greece imposed controls to control a run on its banks. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum July 5 on reforms sought by the country's creditors, and Greece is expected to miss a Tuesday deadline for a payment to the International Monetary Fund.

The U.S. stock market fared better than its overseas counterparts. Bourses in France and Germany slumped 3.7% and 3.6%, respectively. The Shanghai composite swooned 3.3%.

  

Volume on Wall Street was lower across the board, as Friday's rebalancing of Russell indexes caused trading to swell and resulted in a smaller share total for Monday.

  

With lower volume, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 avoided adding to an already heavy load of distribution days. But sellers were firmly in control in Monday's session. Losing issues swamped advancers by nearly 10 to 1 on the NYSE and nearly 7 to 1 on the Nasdaq.

  

Many leading stocks also took it on the chin, sending the IBD 50 down 2.7%, with 48 of its stocks ending lower.

  

**Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) both triggered the 8% sell rule from buy points.

  

**Vasco Data Security** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)) also set off a sell signal. It wiped out a 24% gain from a 28.27 handle buy point, but found support at its 50-day line.

  

There was a silver lining to Monday's market thrashing: The put-call volume ratio jumped to 1.24 from 1.02 Friday (as seen on Page B2).

  

That puts the indicator at a level that has coincided with several market lows for more than a year now.

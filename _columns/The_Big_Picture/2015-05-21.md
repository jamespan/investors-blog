=============================================================

Stocks kept to their monthslong trading range Thursday, as the indexes tacked on small gains. The Nasdaq tapped out a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%.The IBD 50 rose 0.5%.

  

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE, as the market moved closer to the three-day Memorial Day weekend.

  

Although the market is in a confirmed uptrend (thanks to the Nasdaq's May 14 follow-through day), the indexes haven't been able to convincingly break free of a trading range that goes back to early March.

  

The Nasdaq can't seem to get more than 2% above the 5000 level, or more than 3% below 5000. The S&P 500's range is even tighter. This is not the sort of action that makes life easy on either the bulls or the bears.

  

What then should the IBD-style investors do?

  

One thing that might be useful is to look at which breakouts have been working this year.

  

Let's look at stocks that broke out within a day of earlier follow-through days or when market resumed an uptrend. •

The Jan. 8 follow-through led to a breakout and 54% gain for **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)). On Jan. 9, **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) broke out and eventually climbed 28% and 38%, respectively.

  

•On Jan. 23, when IBD noted a market uptrend had resumed, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) broke out. The stock gained 20% from the day's low to its April 24 peak.

  

•On Feb. 10, an uptrend-resumed signal led to a **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) breakout and eventual 24% gain.

  

Other shifts in the market's condition weren't especially productive. And the breakouts since May 14 are too early to judge.

  

The point here is that despite the rangebound action of the indexes, good gainers are emerging. Individual investors need to be discerning and selective. This is a market for rifle-shot accuracy, not the shotgun approach.

  

Economic news served a full plate of negatives Thursday. Several reports were worse than expected: first-time jobless claims, the Chicago Fed National Activity gauge, the Purchasing Managers Index, the Philly Fed's manufacturing index, existing home sales and the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index.

  

Leading indicators, though, were stronger than expected, thanks to growth in building permits and the interest rate spread.

  

The fact that the market could take the mostly negative news in stride was a good sign.

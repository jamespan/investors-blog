The stock market closed lower after a flurry of earnings reports, although Wednesday's losses pretty much kept a mild-mannered market uptrend intact.


The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 0.6% in a day in which techs were the weakest sector. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) slid 3.7%, more than wiping out Tuesday's 1.4% gain. Much of the sector's weakness was in semiconductors, after **Advanced Micro Devices**' ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) [weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q3-2024-earnings/) shook the chip sector.




Software and internet stocks helped offset some tech losses. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) pared its gain to 2.8% following a splendid third-quarter earnings report.


The S&P 500 reversed lower 0.3% and is practically back at the same spot it was a week ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% and closed near session lows for the third time in the past four sessions.


Most of the selling occurred in afternoon trading. Declining stocks topped advancers by about a 3-2 ratio on the Nasdaq, but winners slightly beat losers on the NYSE.


The IBD 50 index underperformed the stock market with a 0.8% drop. **Hims & Hers** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) plunged more than 14%. The online provider of wellness products may have fallen in sympathy with **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), whose [sales of weight-loss drugs missed expectations.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/eli-lilly-stock-eli-lilly-earnings-diabetes-weight-loss-drugs/)


After Wednesday's close, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) were the latest Magnificent Seven companies to announce earnings. Microsoft beat profit expectations and shares rose about 1% in extended trading. But Meta fell more than 2%.


Stock Market Indexes Vary
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP103024-179x300.jpg)While the stock market has softened a bit, IBD continues to recommend 80%-100% exposure. The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) is manageable. The S&P 500, though, narrowly avoided a distribution day Wednesday as volume edged lower on the NYSE. Nasdaq volume fell more than 5%.


Each in its own way, the main indexes are crafting their own versions of the stock market uptrend.


The Nasdaq is the current leader, having notched a record high this week. Up 2.3% in October, the composite made a record high Wednesday but came short of a new closing high.


The communications services and technology sectors take much of the credit, up 2.7% and 1.7% this month. That's a welcome trend for the Nasdaq, which is [weighted about 56% in techs](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-composite-benchmark-for-the-21st-century). More importantly, they are two of just four S&P sectors up in October, and Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) is barely 0.3% higher.


The S&P 500 has been going sideways for two weeks. Yet, it is less than 1% from new highs and still holding above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The Dow is the only major index down for the month, about 2.6% off its prior high and testing the 42,000 level. It's been hit with weakness from some consumer components such as **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).


On Wednesday, **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) cost the Dow 54 of its 91-point drop. **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) is another industrial stock hurting the Dow.


In small caps, the Russell 2000 continues to be the most volatile. It is rebounding from a pullback to the 50-day moving average and nearing another test of resistance around 2,300.


Stock Market Digests GDP And Jobs Data
--------------------------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield was nearly flat at 4.26% vs. Tuesday afternoon quotes. The yield erased a morning drop that greeted economic data.


In the first measurement of third-quarter gross domestic product, the U.S. economy rose 2.8%. That's slightly slower than the 3% increase in Q2 and below economists' consensus forecast.


The ADP National Employment Report showed a better-than-expected increase of 233,000 jobs in October, up from 143,000 in September.


"This makes two consecutive quarters now of well-above potential GDP growth for the U.S. economy, built on a solid foundation of accelerating real consumer spending and government spending growth, and steady nonresidential fixed investment," Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a report. "Volatile quarterly trade flows and inventory changes will largely be ignored by the Federal Reserve."


Anderson also noted a positive trend in inflation, with the GDP price index slowing to a 1.8% annualized rate in Q3 from 2.5% in the second quarter. Other inflation gauges also eased.

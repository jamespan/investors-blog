Stock Indexes Peg Modest Gains, But Strong Volume Is Missing
=============================================================

Stocks traded in a tight range Thursday, with low volume pointing to institutional indifference.

  

The Nasdaq and the IBD 50 pegged 0.1% gains each, while the S&P 500 added 0.4%.

  

Volume fell across the board as the market headed into the three-day weekend. The market closes for the Good Friday observance.

  

The S&P 500 failed to retake its 50-day moving average Thursday, but the Nasdaq remained above its 50-day line.

  

Recently, the stock indexes have shown a discouraging trend of light volume on up days and rising volume on down days.

  

It is a sign of funds selling into strength.

  

It is also the sort of thing seen when a market is topping — but it is nothing new to this stock market. In the past couple of years, such action has led to only moderate pullbacks.

  

Sometimes it has meant that the IBD-style investor could've sat through the turbulence, provided that the stocks in his or her portfolio didn't trigger sell rules. Other times, booking profits or cutting losses made more sense.

  

How does the investor know which to do? The appropriate strategy is dictated by the stocks in the individual's portfolio.

  

Different investors can face different realities.

  

Those who bought **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) in their October breakouts are sitting on decent gains — if, and this is a big if, they managed to hold through the turbulence in the December-January period.

  

Those who bought more youthful plays such as **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) probably found the stocks impossible to hold.

  

Overall, small caps have outperformed this year, but this fact deserves an asterisk. Yes, the small-cap S&P 600 is up 3.8%, vs. 0.4% for the large-cap S&P 500. However, the elite IBD Big Cap 20 yardstick is up 9%.

  

Scanning the Big Cap 20 for buy candidates might be a good idea at this point. But whether a stock is good or not, the market tone needs improvement. Without a tailwind, it's unrealistic to expect stocks to do much.

  

On Friday, breakouts included used-car retailer **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)), thinly traded restaurant stock **Nathan's Famous** ([NATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NATH)) and department store **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)).

  

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq was essentially flat.

  

In the coming week, the quarterly earnings season gets started, but it won't get into full swing until mid-April.

  

The March payroll data were scheduled to be released Friday. With the exchanges closed, it won't be until Monday that the market can react to it.

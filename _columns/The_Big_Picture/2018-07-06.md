Bullish Surprise: Stock Indexes Dash Higher Despite Tariffs
============================================================

U.S. stocks indexes rumbled higher Friday, leaving a mystery as to what bullish factor outranked a trade war.




The Nasdaq dashed 1.3% higher, while the S&P 500 ran ahead 0.8%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trailed with a 0.4% gain. The small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.8%. The index is a leader, trading closer to a new high than the other indexes.


Volume was down on both major exchanges.


Technicals improved as the May 31 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell off the count because of time.

A bullish change in market outlook might seem remarkable given the tariffs. At a minute past midnight Thursday, the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods. China matched the figure with $34 billion on U.S. goods.


How then did the bulls find conviction?


Market watchers can point to several possibilities.


No. 1: Old news is good news: The stock market has had more than five months to sort through trade-war fears. It's possible that the bulls are convinced that the war will be a short one.


No. 2: Friday's payroll numbers dealt some aces. The May reading of 223,000 jobs was revised to 244,000. The June report came in at 213,000, above the highest estimate in the range.


Wage gains meantime remained contained, lessening worries on inflation.

No. 3: Earnings season is about to begin. Three major banks — **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) — will kick off the reporting season Friday. Last time around, results for major banks didn't help their stock prices much.


Yet, tax rates and regulations have been moving in a friendly direction for banks. The stocks need some earnings surprises to drive share prices higher.


No. 4: Too much is too much. In the blue chip Dow, 12 of the 30 components have Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of D minus or a worst-possible E.


Much of this is because stocks such as **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) have sold off in fear of a trade war.


If bulls are convinced that the selling is overdone, they could step in and support such stocks.


Supreme Court And Stocks
------------------------


On Monday, President Trump is expected to reveal his pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who will step down July 31.


This could be important to businesses. The court's new term begins Oct. 1. One of the cases the court is expected to rule on is the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

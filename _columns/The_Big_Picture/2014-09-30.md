===================================================

Stock indexes fell modestly Tuesday yet left the market still in a state of indecision.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 0.3% in a day of seesaw trading. Volume rose across the board as institutional investors tidied up their portfolios for the conclusion of the quarter.

  

Losing stocks led winners by about 11 to 5 on the Nasdaq and by roughly 8 to 5 on the NYSE.

  

The losses resulted in another distribution day for the indexes. With seven higher-volume declines on the Nasdaq and six on the S&P 500 in recent weeks, there's reason to expect a significant market top in the making.

  

However, some of those distribution days haven't been severe. Monday's distribution on the S&P 500, for instance, saw the index make a somewhat positive price reversal.

  

That day aside, the indexes are clearly limping as the market tries to sort itself out. Leading stocks also are trying to find their way. Lots of them are testing support levels on their charts, but few so far have rallied and resumed their advances.

  

High-growth names got hit harder. The IBD 50 fell 0.9%.

  

Uncertain markets make life difficult for stock pickers, a trend that's evident in the IBD Mutual Fund Index. Almost all of the 20 funds in the index are lagging the broad averages.

  

A few of those funds invest in small-capitalization stocks, which have taken a much bigger beating than larger-cap stocks.

  

While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are only about 2% off their highs, the Russell 2000 is more than 9% off its July 1 peak. The Russell lost nearly 1.5% Tuesday.

  

The put-call volume ratio has served as a good indicator of market lows this year. This week, it topped 1.0, a level that indicates elevated fear in the market but also essentially marked the low in January. Readings around 1.1 coincided with the market lows in April and August.

  

While the market seeks direction, some sector rotation is taking place. There was more evidence that the auto sector is skidding after **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) Monday lowered its pretax earnings outlook for the year. Ford shares have slid 9% so far this week.

  

**Gentherm** ([THRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THRM)) — which makes heated car seats and had been a market winner — tumbled 10% in heavy volume, making a sharp break below the 50-day moving average. **Harman International Industries** ([HAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAR)), whose products include auto audio systems, fell 4% and sank further below the 200-day moving average.

  

**Avis Budget** ([CAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAR)), a stock that crosses over into the leisure sector, careened 7% in heavy trading. Reports said that the company was cautious about its 2014 targets and that its European business is sluggish.

  

As they exit autos, institutions have kept moving money into the health care sector. Three of the top four Fidelity sector funds this year are in that sector, as the table on Page B10 shows.

  

The top five sector ETFs are medical and semiconductor funds. Watch those sectors for emerging opportunities.

  

The consumer specialty products industry group has risen sharply. But in that group, the meteoric **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) has shouldered the industry's advance.

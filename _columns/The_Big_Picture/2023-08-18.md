The stock market closed mixed Friday as indexes tried to find their footing at the end of a painful week. Investors will now be tuning in to a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) earnings.




The Nasdaq composite briefly fought its way out of negative territory but closed 0.2% lower, ending the week with a painful 2.6% drawdown. It lost more ground on [the key 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and has now fallen for the third week in a row, its longest weekly losing streak since December.


The S&P 500 was fractionally lower but essentially flat. It too ended well off its lows for the day. It closed more than 2% lower for the week and is also below its 50-day line. The S&P remains up more than 14% for the year but is well off recent highs.

While it fell below its 50-day moving average Thursday it is now within striking distance of the benchmark. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) were the top performers here.


Small caps managed to end in the green, with the Russell 2000 lifting 0.5%. Growth stocks also turned in slight gains, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 0.2%.


The stock market is currently in the grip of a correction, but Friday's action could be the start of a rally attempt. This is because we consider a down day closing in the upper half of its true range a pink rally day. IBD is recommending an exposure range of 20%-40%. But it is crucial to stay engaged and to build up a robust watchlist in case the market conditions change once again.


Fed Chair Powell's Speech, Nvidia Earnings Loom
-----------------------------------------------


Stocks got punished following the latest Fed minutes release. Now investors will be looking for further clues on monetary policy when Fed Chair Powell makes his annual speech at the Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., next Friday.


Perhaps even more crucial from a market perspective is the forthcoming earnings report of **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which comes Wednesday. The AI theme, which has gripped the market in 2023, has made NVDA one of the year's top performers.


If Nvidia manages to serve up strong guidance for the third quarter it could boost upside momentum.


Other key earnings reports next week include **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) and **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)).

These Farming Stocks Hurt Stock Market
--------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the session mixed with a slight bias to the upside. Energy and utilities fared best, while consumer discretionary and communication services were the worst performing areas.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gives investors a more granular insight into the day's action.


Mail order plays, newspaper stocks, departments stores, office supply retailers and oil & gas drillers were among the best performers.


Conversely, cable & satellite plays, travel booking and automakers were among the laggards. Farm machinery stocks struggled badly despite **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) serving up impressive results amid worries over future demand.

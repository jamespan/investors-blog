Bulls Fail To Lose Their Nerve Ahead Of Big Federal Reserve Decision

Stock investors shrugged off deep uncertainty Wednesday over when and how quickly the Federal Reserve will remove its policy of zero interest rates. The major indexes rallied and finished near session highs. Volume grew, suggesting that institutional investors are comfortable going long in equities, regardless of what the central bank decides at 2 p.m. ET Thursday.

  

The S&P 500 outdid the Nasdaq composite Wednesday, a rare feat lately. The S&P rose 0.9%, ahead of the latter's 0.6% gain. The S&P SmallCap 600 was also up 0.9%. The interest rate-sensitive Dow utilities rallied 1.2%.

  

Oil and gas, mining, apparel, alcohol, jewelry and railroad stocks paced the upside. Data from the Energy Information Administration showed a sharp weekly draw in crude oil inventories. Wall Street expected a lift.

  

There were other elements to like about Wednesday's action. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by more than a 3-to-1 margin. That's been a rarity lately.

  

As the NYSE advance-decline line shows (see the S&P 500 chart on B2), advancing stocks have largely matched decliners. Not so with the Nasdaq. While the win-loss ratio Wednesday was less pronounced (8-to-5), the Nasdaq's A-D line itself has risen sharply over the past three weeks.

  

Since the Sept. 8 follow-through, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have gotten hit with only one distribution day so far. The Sept. 9 reversal was ugly. Yet the market has coasted higher in a smooth manner since then.

  

The Nasdaq composite is just a 1.4% gain away from retaking its 50-day moving average.

  

The pundits and bankers who believe the Fed will not raise rates certainly can point to low inflation data. On Wednesday, the core CPI index for August inched up 0.1%, missing the Econoday consensus view of a 0.2% gain.

  

However, the U.S. 1-year Treasury bond yield hit a 12-month high. And the benchmark 10-year bond yield has surged more than 25 basis points since the "World Black Monday" sell-off on Aug. 24. Does this suggest that some bond traders have been selling debt to avoid getting caught in a potential harsh sell-off later this week or the next?

  

No one would dispute the fact that no matter what the Fed does Thursday or in the final two meetings of the year (Oct. 27-28 and Dec. 15-16), the cost of money remains extremely low.

  

When the Fed last raised interest rates in June 2006, the fed funds rate went up 25 basis points to 5.25%. Back then, that produced hefty income streams for both the regional banks as well as retired individuals.

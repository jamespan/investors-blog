Thirteen days since IBD called a ["market in correction" on Feb. 25](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/), the stock market crash has featured one of the most punishing short-term sell-offs in generations. Friday's gains, however, gave the market a new chance to begin the bottoming process.




President Trump's late-hour announcement to engage in all-out war to "combat and defeat" Covid-19 with a range of new measures unleashed heavy buying in the final half-hour of trading. Yet even after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 soared more than 9% Friday, they still logged weekly declines that ranged from almost 9% for these two indexes to 16% by the S&P SmallCap 600. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dove 14% for the week.


Trump said he'd suspend interest payments on all student debt for now. He directed the energy secretary to fill the strategic petroleum reserve to the brim. Oil jumped more than 5%. But U.S. Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), which tracks West Texas Intermediate oil prices, still dropped more than 20% for the week.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP031320-300x296.jpg)What news will end this biggest decline in U.S. stock wealth since the 2008-2009 subprime debt debacle? Neither lower energy prices, nor another big cut in interest rates are likely to do it. Interest rates have been low forever. More workers in the oil and gas industry face the threat of losing their jobs.


"As the experience of 2015/2016 has shown, a decline in oil prices is no longer a net positive for the U.S. economy," Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, wrote in a client note. "It may benefit consumer pocketbooks, but at times of uncertainty consumers are likely to save the windfall and not spend."


Ultimately, when will growth in new coronavirus cases and deaths in the U.S. and Europe flatten out? Answers to these questions may halt this virus-infested equities slide.


All week long, defensive sectors offered virtually no place to hide. The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) plunged more than 14% for the week.


The speed of the market's decline since [IBD declared a market in correction on Feb. 25](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) has been almost unprecedented.


During the Black Monday Crash of 1987, the Dow Jones industrials plunged 35% over a 17-day span. The Russell 2000's slide in recent weeks was nearly 34% over 15 sessions. It will take time for the next batch of strong growth stocks to rebound back near highs, sculpt a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), and finally break out to new highs. But this cycle will run its course. You can sum up Wall Street in two words: fear and greed. Eventually, the former subsides and the latter returns.

Stock Market Crash And Investor Psychology Today
------------------------------------------------


Fear indicators, also known as [investor sentiment gauges](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), went haywire this past week.


The put-call volume ratio soared to 1.43 on Thursday, nearly matching a 1.44 reading on Monday. In both cases, investors bought more than 140 bearish puts for every 100 bullish calls. The [Cboe market volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) (VIX) soared as much 84% for the week.


These sentiment indicators don't gauge greed.



For that, you need to spot a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/). Monitor the day-to-day action. And keep the watchlist fresh. Look for names such as **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which have fallen less in recent weeks than the major averages. Some of these large caps used the 200-day moving average as a springboard to go higher Friday. That's unusual. Most stocks on Wall Street have dived below their respective 200-day lines.

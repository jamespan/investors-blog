The stock market took a breather Monday to digest Friday's earnings-fueled rally, giving back precious little.




The Nasdaq composite was down a fraction, holding on to Friday's 2.2% surge. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.4%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE. That's a sign institutional investors chose not to sell into strength and they are content to hold around record highs.


The Dow suffered under the weight of **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)). Merck lost 6% for the second straight day. Reports say GE, one of the weakest Dow components this year, is considering [shedding some businesses](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-is-looking-to-offload-locomotive-health-it-businesses-wsj/) to cut billions in costs.


Selling was heaviest before lunchtime. News that a corporate tax cut would be phased in over several years under a plan in the House seemed to shake the market. Some of the October stock gains rest on hopes that Republicans will push through tax reform, perhaps before winter.

The Russell 2000 slid 1.2%; the S&P SmallCap 600 lost 1.4%. That may say something about risk appetite, because small caps represent the more speculative part of the market.


But it's big caps that have reasserted their lead. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) followed through on Friday's breakouts.


It's a bad sign if only a few big stocks are leading the market. But the NYSE advance-decline line is near new highs. The Nasdaq's line looks less firm after easing for three weeks. On Monday, decliners were twice as numerous as advancers on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, losers led by 8-to-5.


The number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) remains low and got lower Monday, when the S&P 500's Sept. 25 distribution day was deleted because of its age. A cluster of distribution Oct. 18-25 raised suspicions about the market's ability to keep rising. But after a modest pullback, the indexes responded with sharp gains and new highs on Friday.


That strength showed the market is not ready to quit an uptrend that's lasted 16 months since its most recent follow-through bottoming confirmation, on June 30, 2016.


There are some areas showing weakness where sell signals are occurring.



The Dow transportation average slid 1.2% as trucking and logistics companies came under selling. IBD's trucking industry group has revved up top the top 10 of 197 industry groups, but there was profit-taking in the group Monday. **Heartland Express** ([HTLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTLD)) skidded 5% and dug deeper below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). It fell 6% Friday after earnings came out.


Retail, banks, some health care were other lagging groups.


In the education services group (in the 60s among 197 groups ranked by six-month performance), changes are unfolding in the group's leadership. Chinese companies that led much of this year, namely **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), have fallen below the 50-day lines.


Meanwhile, thinly traded **Strayer Education** ([STRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRA)) broke out of a base Monday as it agreed to buy group peer **Capella Education** ([CPLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPLA)). Strayer surged 9% to 100 while Capella soared 30.5%. The two for-profit schools said they would [merge in a $1.9 billion deal](https://www.investors.com/news/lennar-strayer-dynegy-announce-deals-these-may-be-next/).


China-based **Hailiang Education Group** ([HLG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLG)), averaging fewer than 30,000 shares a day in volume, has surged from its 50-day line.

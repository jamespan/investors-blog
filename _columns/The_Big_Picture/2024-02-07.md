Perhaps you've heard this old saw of the stock market: *Strength begets strength. Weakness begets weakness.* Wednesday's action oozed this truth.




The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 paced another bullish session as investors en masse decided to favor the strength of earnings reports over the [ongoing uncertainty encircling](https://www.investors.com/news/regional-banks-climb-new-york-community-bank-pares-losses-on-new-chairman-after-moodys-junk-rating/) embattled **New York Community Bancorp** ([NYCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NYCB)).


The stock market rally on Wednesday mainly sourced its fuel from technology.


Looking at the [top 20 industry groups of the day](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-feb-07-2024/), they included security software (up 3.4%, based on preliminary data). Fabless semiconductor, integrated computer systems and design software firms each rallied more than 2% on a price-weighted basis.


As such, the Nasdaq composite paced the upside of the stock market, gaining nearly 1%.


Stock Market Today: Nasdaq Eyes New Highs
-----------------------------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP020524-1-233x300.jpg)At 15,756, it's now climbed to less than 3% below an all-time summit of 16,212. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) rose 1%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% and made its 10th record close in 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 added 0.8% and is challenging the 5,000 level.


Small caps faltered. The Russell 2000 edged 0.2% lower but held mildly above the 50-day moving average. At 1950, the Russell remains down 3.8% for the year, compared with a 5.5% lift since Jan. for QQQ.


The Dow Jones transportation average posted its fourth gain in five sessions, up 0.4%. At 16,076, the Dow transports moved back into mildly positive territory in 2024.


Volume jumped 10% on the NYSE vs. Tuesday to 4.9 billion shares. On the Nasdaq, turnover edged 4% lower to 4.57 billion. The Jan. 2 distribution day on the S&P 500 fell off due to length of time.


Don't Ignore These Top Sectors
------------------------------


Let's not forget that tech does not single-handedly move the Nasdaq 100.


The General Market Indicators page (found at the bottom of each Big Picture column) shows how a few nontechnology firms can exert their influence as well.


For instance, Priceline operator **Booking** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), part of the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist), is one of the 30 biggest companies on the Nasdaq. Booking shares are rallying nicely after a test of the 10-week moving average. Booking's gains helped propel the IBD Leisure-Travel Booking industry group to a 2.2% advance.


Hold True Stock Market Winners A Long Time
------------------------------------------


Booking has been a superlative long-term winner.



After the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 ended, Booking joined the winners' circle. In July of 2009, BKNG shares cleared a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 119.14 at the time and cruised to multiyear highs. That base was part of a deep first-stage consolidation. Booking doubled by the spring of 2010, formed another deep base, then broke out again.


Now trading at 3,708, Booking has booked a 30-fold gain, roughly equal to a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of nearly 26%.


Another nontech leader within the top 30 names has been **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)). Shares have recently surpassed the [20%-25% profit zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) after a breakout near 570.


[IBD's stock tables as of Wednesday's close](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-07-2024/) currently show nine of the top 10 sectors posting year-to-date gains of 3% or more. They range from Apparel (up 12% since Jan. 1) and Building (up 3.6%) to Leisure (4.1%) and Machine (4.8%).

It's Not Just About Tech Stocks
-------------------------------



Booking, as well as fabless semiconductor firm **Arm** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), illustrate this history-proven principle of how strength begets strength.


Both companies have proven agility in their businesses. Arm's earnings and sales growth in Q3 showed acceleration. Annually, Arm's earnings have grown substantially.


Institutional support in both stocks has led to follow-on entry points, including bursts off the 10-week moving average, in addition to breakouts from bullish patterns including the cup with handle.


Arm joined [Leaderboard as a half size position](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Dec. 8 near 65.


The stock market usually delivers a parade of weakness as well. Lately, defensive stocks including utilities, alcohol and tobacco have lagged. They headed into Wednesday's trading ranked at the bottom of [IBD's sector-organized stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-06-2024/).

Could These Stock Market Laggards Get Weaker?
---------------------------------------------


Banks have had a mixed showing since the stock market signaled a potential new uptrend on Nov. 1 with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both posting strong [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Wall Street firms have generally done better but they haven't been outright leaders as well.


Meanwhile, regional lenders are still trying to remove the proverbial foot from their throats after a horrendous 2023, in which regional powerhouses SVB Financial, Signature Bank of N.Y. and First Republic all went belly up. Depositors fled these banks at the worst possible time. Why? They sat on big mark-to-market losses in their gigantic U.S. debt holdings.



Could New York Community Bancorp be next?


NYCB, which plunged 42% last week in the heaviest volume in its stock market history, has cratered another 26% this week to 4.46. Volume this week in NYCB? It's already surpassed last week's record. The 376 million shares exchanging hands this week are already more than half the stock's total float (freely tradable shares) of 708 million shares.


Moody's downgraded the bank's debt securities to junk status on a range of concerns. The company announced a new executive chairman and is thinking of unloading some of its commercial real estate-related loans. Bloomberg Intelligence warned that such a move could hit revenues.


NYCB shares reversed off Wednesday's low to rise 6.7%. In no way would this up day serve as a buy signal. Individual investors, and to a large degree professional fund managers, will generally have more success deploying capital in companies that are already showing technical and fundamental strength. IBD research has found that the average time from [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) to peak in the biggest stock market winners runs at least 18 months.


Psychological Sentiment Today
-----------------------------


Bullishness among newsletter editors cooled to 54.3% vs. 57.7% a week ago, according to Investors Intelligence.


Bearishness among the pundits edged up to 17.1% vs. 16.9% last week. Investors Intelligence commented that "most of the former bulls shifted to projecting a correction, lifting that reading to 28.6% from 25.4% last issue."


The research firm also noted the bull-bear spread narrowing to +37.2% vs. 40.8% last week ago, which stood as the widest margin since July 2021. Investors Intelligence added "spreads above 40% point to elevated risk."


The Cboe Market Volatility Index dropped 1.8% to 12.83, still above its near-term low of 11.81 marked on Dec. 12.

Positive Movement In Bonds
--------------------------


The yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, meanwhile, edged up 2 basis points to 4.11%. That's still well below the benchmark yield's October peak of 4.99%.


Could the yield stay in a range for a while? Absolutely. The stock market, of course, is trying its best to read the tea leaves left by Federal Reserve bank leaders as they comment on what is required in terms of inflation and economic data before the U.S. central bank embarks on potential monetary easing.


What is the bond market saying lately? A thinning of the spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury securities — currently at a negative 32 basis points as of Wednesday (4.41% for the 2-year note and 4.09% for the 10-year note) vs. -38 basis points on Jan. 2 (4.33% vs 3.95%) based on U.S. Treasury data — hints at a future normalization of the yield curve. This is critical; a positively sloped yield curve stimulates bank loans and economic growth.


The current fed funds rate, or what the Federal Reserve charges big banks on overnight cash infusions, has stood at a 5%-5.25% target range since early August.


What Could Pull Wage Inflation Lower?
-------------------------------------


Meanwhile, would the news of bigger layoffs, and the dampening effect it could have on workers' wages, be something to watch for? Brent Schutte thinks so.


The chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management argues that the recent figure of 0.6% U.S. wage growth in January vs. the prior month, doubling the 0.3% gain in December, underlines the difficulty right now in hastily cutting interest rates, which would likely give a fresh boost to both the economy and the stock market.


"With nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported quarterly earnings, revenue for the quarter is up 3.3% year over year — well below the pace of wage growth," Schutte wrote in a note emailed to clients. He added that on a year-over year basis, earnings among workers in production and non-supervisory roles jumped 4.8%, or "well above the 3% to 3.5% pace the Fed believes is consistent with its target of 2 percent inflation."


"That means to maintain profit margins companies will either be forced to raise prices (inflation) or cut costs, which could include laying off workers. Either approach would be at odds with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability," Schutte commented.

U.S. stock indexes kept to an indefinite pattern Thursday, unable to find consistent direction between one day and the next.


The Nasdaq eased less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 tacked on less than 0.1%. The IBD 50 rose 0.2%. Volume fell on both major exchanges.


The Nasdaq has moved essentially sideways since scoring an all-time high Sept. 22. The S&P 500 also has shown indifference, except it is stuck under its 50-day moving average.


Technically, the market improved a bit Thursday. The Aug. 31 distribution day fell off the S&P 500 because of time. After five weeks, distribution is too old to be considered part of current market conditions.


![mp100616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP100616-186x300.png)The bulls and the bears alike could use a catalyst to drive the market in one direction or the other.


While news can take a surprise turn at any time, there are three factors that could shape the market in the weeks ahead.


No. 1, the U.S. presidential election is less than five weeks away, but it isn't clear that the market has settled on a bet yet.


Political gridlock is looking possible. Although some folks talk about gridlock as if it were a problem, the market seems to prefer a do-no-harm atmosphere. Some research indicates that the S&P 500 performs better with the Senate and House out of session than in session.


No. 2, Q3 earnings season will pick up its pace in the coming weeks. This is usually a source for good or bad surprises. But different markets reward or punish to their own disposition. Watch beats and misses to see if the market reveals its bias.


Holding through earnings season is always a tough question. Two things should shape the individual investor's approach: Profit cushions and whether the market is in a forgiving or unforgiving mood.


Options are another way to limit risk. See the Investor's Corner articles on ["4 Questions To Ask During Earnings Season"](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/4-questions-to-ask-during-earnings-season/) and ["New Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings."](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/)


Individual investors might study their portfolio to see if anything looks like it might be "priced for perfection." Such stocks will often dive even on a beat. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) dropped after reporting a small earnings beat in late August. The stock sold off 17% in the ensuing pullback.


Ulta Beauty is recovering now and could be ready to build the right side of a new base. The stock is 13% off its high.


No. 3, Britain's exit from the European Union, also known as Brexit, could heat up anxieties again. The United Kingdom will start the official proceedings March 17, beginning a two-year countdown. Britain would leave the EU in early 2019.


Leaders breaking out were scarce Thursday. Wine, beer and spirits provider **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), which tried and failed to stay above its buy point Wednesday, got the job done Thursday. The stock closed 1% above a 168.78 buy point.


First-time jobless claims fell to near the lowest level since late 1973. On Friday, nonfarm payroll data will be released before the market's open. The Street expects 168,000 jobs added. The range of estimates runs from 155,000 to 200,000, according to Econoday.

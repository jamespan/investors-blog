title: Stocks Today Thrust Higher In Lighter Volume; 3 Factors That Will Help Turn The Market

Are omicron fears waning? And did stocks today reflect confidence in the economy?




Judging by the action in key indexes and relevant sectors, one could immediately think "Yes." But a technical recovery in the stock market is far from complete. Hence, a cautious stance toward picking stocks appears warranted.


The Nasdaq composite's 2.4% gain erased nearly three days of losses. But notice on a daily chart how the tech-rich index has now spent four of the past five trading sessions with a close beneath its 50-day moving average.


In strong equity markets, both stocks and indexes not only trade above their respective 50-day lines. They actually lead them higher.


That's what makes the S&P 500's gain, albeit smaller at 1.8%, more meaningful.



Stocks Today: Eye These Sectors Now
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP122121-201x300.jpg)The large-cap benchmark benefitted from demand returning to travel-related stocks, as well as sectors such as real estate, health care and medicine, banks, semiconductors and enterprise software. Now, some of the big winners in these areas still look bloodied and bruised.


Just look at the fall in names such as Slack project management tool rival **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), chipmaking lithography systems behemoth **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and U.S. homebuilder **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)). Only Horton is actually in a proper buy zone. But it also gave back moderate gains since its breakout past a double bottom with a 99.75 [initial buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Atlassian is now trying to carve out a bottom near 332 and shape the right side of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Ditto for ASML, stuck in "no man's land" territory between its 50-day moving average and its longer-term 200-day line.


The NYSE composite rebounded 1.8%, while iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) jumped almost 2.9%. These indexes also are still treading beneath their 50-day lines. Yet on the positive side, the latest correction of 2021 hasn't approached the magnitude of techs' steep fall in late January to February.


Volume fell on both exchanges, but only slightly so on the Nasdaq.


As noted in this [Stock Market Today column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-gains-nasdaq-leads-joe-biden-makes-omicron-plea-travel-stocks-pop-airbnb-stock/), President Joe Biden made an impassioned plea to Americans to do whatever it takes to stop the highly virulent strain of Covid-19 dead in its tracks.


As to be expected, breadth improved dramatically after Monday's drubbing. Advancers trounced decliners by a 3-1 margin on the Nasdaq, and by more than 4 to 1 on the NYSE.


Did defensive stocks take a back seat to Tuesday's advancers? A quick way to check: Watch SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) and SPDR Consumer Staples ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)). The two ETFs edged slightly lower. But both funds have glowed in the fourth quarter.


3 Factors To Watch Now
----------------------


Investor psychology in stocks today is not overly optimistic. Nor is it extremely pessimistic. Likely this is a good thing for stock investors. But it's still interesting to note that the ratio of premiums for bearish put options vs. premiums for bullish call options came close to a 12-month high. You can track it daily via the Psychological Indicators at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


Meanwhile, stocks today need at least these three conditions for the bull market to get back on track.


One, the indexes need to get back into a solid trend of higher highs and higher lows. Just looking at how they're trading in respect to their moving averages provides only a limited view. Whether you see a daily chart or a weekly one, try to draw a trend line along the lows of the major averages, then ask yourself: Is this index really moving higher? Check out the S&P MidCap 400 (zero-SPMC at MarketSmith). On Monday it sank below the 200-day moving average for the the second time in nearly three weeks. Significant price progress has been virtually absent since May.


Two, are quality sectors participating? This is where screening for strength in the [MarketSmith 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), the IBD Stock Spotlight, Big Cap 20 and IBD 50 can help a lot. The latter three computer-generated lists can be accessed via the Stock Lists tab at Investors.com.


Finally, keep surveying the number of new highs vs. new lows (also updated every day at IBD Data Tables). During Monday's sell-off, just 19 companies on either the Nasdaq or NYSE made a 52-week or all-time high. That compares unfavorably with 182 NYSE-listed issues hitting record lows and 253 stocks on the Nasdaq. A healthy market is going to show the exact opposite trend.


Beyond Stocks Today
-------------------


The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield gained 6 basis points to 1.48%. That doesn't sound like a whole lot. But it means a ton for lenders as the yield curve steepened. Small and midsize banks rallied, and they still make up a meaningful section of the general stock market.

Stock Indexes Give Back Small Piece Of Recent Gains
====================================================

Stocks took a timeout Thursday after three days of big gains.


The Nasdaq lost 1%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively.


The IBD 50 retreated 0.4%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges, lessening the sting of the losses.


After the Nasdaq piled up a 6% gain over the previous three sessions and the S&P 500 added 5% in the same period, some kind of adjustment was natural.

At this point, the bulls are hoping the stock market can avoid distribution while letting potential leaders build bases.


Distribution involves a loss in a major index in rising volume. It points to institutional selling. When it comes soon after a new uptrend is confirmed, the uptrend often fails.


That's what happened one day after the Jan. 26 uptrend confirmation. The uptrend soon came under pressure, and never accomplished much.


For an uptrend to work, the indexes need to provide a tailwind, and the market has to provide leaders.


The difficulty now is twofold: Quality breakouts are scarce so far, and the IBD 50 has a defensive composition.


In Wednesday's IBD 50, real estate investment trusts, utilities, discount stores and conservative stocks made up 26% of the field.


This is unusual. In a vigorous uptrend, utilities only appear in the income screens.


The strength among discount stores is somewhat less troubling but still not ideal.


Ideally, bulls would like to see upscale retail stocks replace the discounter stocks and see credible growth stories bump the dividend plays.


In the current market atmosphere, there's no good reason to abandon caution. The improved market conditions appear to be tied to plans to freeze output of crude oil, which could be walked back.


Patience is a good strategy until leaders start appearing and breaking out.


On Thursday, IBD 50 component **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. The stock closed almost 4% above the 75.22 buy point.


Economic news was mixed Thursday.


The Philly Fed's manufacturing survey for February was worse than expected. Leading indicators for January were in line with the consensus target. Jobless claims dipped from the previous reading.


Perhaps the best news involved the money supply. Divisia M4 including Treasuries, the broadest gauge on the money supply, rose 4% in January. This continued an uninterrupted trend that began in July.

title: Bears Still In Hiding As Most Stock Indexes Edge Lower

Market bulls, sit tight. The bears still have not come out swinging.


Wednesday's dull action was ideal for a down day for most key indexes. The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 finished 0.1% lower, while the NYSE composite eased 0.2%. The Russell 2000 lost nearly 0.5%, but still has some of last week's nearly 0.8% gain. The small-cap gauge is also still up 3.4% year-to-date.


In a clear sign that investors are still hungry for large- and megacap equities, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 0.2%.


![mp022217](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP022217-1.png)Volume dropped lightly on both exchanges. But institutional demand is still clearly present. For starters, a greater number of stocks continue to make new highs than make new lows. On Wednesday, the ratio was nearly 10-to-1 on a combined Nasdaq and NYSE basis.


Meanwhile, as seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table, heavy institutional selling continues to fade. The distribution count over the past 25 sessions fell to three on the Nasdaq and two on the S&P 500 as a Jan. 17 sell-off expired based on time, which also knocked off a stalling day on the Nasdaq.


A heavy load of distribution days, or significant declines in heavier volume vs. the prior session, usually marks the end of a confirmed uptrend. Looking at the distribution days still relevant today, none of the three on the Nasdaq or the two on the 500 showed a drop of 1% or more.

Wednesday's release of minutes from the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates elicited mostly yawns. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hardly changed; the spread between 2- and 10-year bond yields has tightened a bit, yet remains healthy.


Recent economic data continue to show a pickup in inflation expectations and stronger prices. They give the U.S. central bank more reason to stick with a plan to raise rates at least two times in 2017. Yet that likely wouldn't diminish the picture that compares equities more favorably than bonds. As noted in a past [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/trump-energizes-bulls-with-phenomenal-tax-plan-can-stocks-rise-even-as-nvidia-rests/), the earnings yield of the S&P 500 still sharply outweighs the 10-year bond yield.


Plus, some observers firmly believe that rate hikes will be gradual in 2017.


Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, noted that "the more cautious voices of the Committee are those voting this year, suggesting patience will likely trump the need for pre-emptive action. After all, with little fear of inflation or growth running hot, many on the Committee would rather have additional clarity in terms of fiscal policy before taking additional action."


Bullishness remains high among the pundits, yet what's really interesting is the extreme range of sentiment in the headlines. Go to RealClearPolitics' homepage and you'll find dour headlines such as "Our Miserable 21st Century" by Nicholas Eberstadt. Yet as reported at CNBC, veteran market analyst Ralph Acampora calls the market "a Reagan-like rally," as the post-Reagan election ushered a six-month honeymoon rally for stocks in the early 1980s.


The Trump Bump is currently in Month 4 of its Wall Street honeymoon.


In this age of "fake news" and 24/7 online journalism, there is a simple way to deal with the almost deafening noise: Stay focused on the day-to-day price and volume action. The charts don't lie.


How are active managers doing? A look at the IBD Mutual Fund Index suggests that it's still a tough slog. (See this index's chart at the bottom of the General Market page by going to the link at the end of this article.) Through Tuesday's market close, the index of actively managed funds is up 5.5%, trailing the Nasdaq by a lot and the S&P 500 by a tad.


However, individual investors have plenty of opportunity to beat the indexes by carefully selecting top growth companies that have broken out of sound bases. There are plenty of pools to fish, not just the Chinese internets.


Many IPOs, even those that went public within the past 36 months, are hot. Chemical firms are hot. **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)) led the Dow 30, up 3.5%, as its merger plan with **Dow Chemical** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) reportedly overcame a key regulatory hurdle.


The CAN SLIM breakout train has not been derailed. Banking, insurance and even some brokerage firms are being stingy about giving back their gains since breakouts in September through November. On Wednesday, **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) (47.32 handle entry) and **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)) (53.67 aggressive buy point) both made strong moves to exit bottoming bases.


In the latest [IBD Industry Themes column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-industry-themes/), markets writer Alan Elliott notes unusual strength in fracking-related sand suppliers. **Smart Sand** ([SND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SND)) is looking smart, indeed, following through on Tuesday's breakout past a narrow IPO base entry at 19.94.

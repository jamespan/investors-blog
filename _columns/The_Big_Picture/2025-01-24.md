The stock market ended a strong week on a sour note Friday as earnings from the likes of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) loom in the coming week. The latest Federal Reserve meeting is also due, where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Donald Trump.


The Nasdaq composite opened in positive territory but ended near session lows as it fell 0.5% Friday. It still sits more than 2% above the important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and turned in a weekly pop of 1.7%, its second in a row. It now holds a lift of 3.3% for January.




The S&P 500 closed just above the 6,100 level despite a daily decline of 0.3%. It sits comfortably clear of its short-term and its major moving averages, a good sign. It ended the week up 1.7%, notching a weekly closing high in the process. The benchmark index is now up 3.7% in 2025.


Advancers actually managed to edge out decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq, adding a distribution day to its count.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lagged Friday, falling 0.3%. But it remained clear of both the 44,000 level and its 50-day line. [Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was the worst laggard, falling 3.1%. **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) fared best with a 1% lift.


Small caps flirted with positive territory, but the Russell 2000 ultimately ended Friday down 0.3%. The 50-day moving average remains a resistance area to watch. Growth stocks fared worse, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund dipping 1%. It's weekly gain of 3.8% was stout, however.


Fed Looms: Will Powell Defy Trump?
----------------------------------


The stock market rallied with aplomb for the second week in a row. The fact President Trump held back on so-called tariff "shock and awe" after taking office cooled investor fears that more trade wars could be imminent, taking some pressure off equities.

The coming week could be another humdinger for indexes, with a number of key events coming into focus. The latest Federal Open Market Committee two-day meeting concludes Wednesday.


The post-meeting media conference could serve as an opportunity for Fed Chair Powell to reiterate the central bank's independence after Trump told the World Economic Forum he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately."


Powell looks set to resist Trump, in the short-term at least, as rates will almost definitely hold steady [according to the CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)


Meanwhile, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index reading is set to drop Friday. Headline PCE is seen rising 2.6% year-over-year while core PCE, which strips out food and energy prices, is seen turning in an annualized pop of 2.8%.


Finally, a slew of important earnings reports are due in the coming week, including several members of the so-called Magnificent Seven. Apple, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), Tesla and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) are all on deck.


The likes of **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) are among other noteworthy reports.


These Stock Market Groups Fall On Texas Guidance

Stocks Mixed As Techs Falter, But These Sectors Outperform; Oil Stocks Flourishing
===================================================================================

The stock market Monday was either good or bad, depending on which types of stocks you own.




It was a bad day if you own technology or growth. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) fell 1%, breaking a four-day win streak. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) dropped 0.9%. The IBD 50, where about half the companies are techs, shed 1.9%.


But by the end of the session, the damage was contained. The Nasdaq found support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The index is trying to establish a beachhead above this crucial level, and Monday's bounce helped meet that goal.


The Nasdaq was down as much as 1.2% but closed 0.5% lower. Yet, advancers led decliners on the Nasdaq by a 7-5 ratio. That can happen when heavyweights like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) have a down day â€” they overshadow action in smaller stocks.


Energy, Financials, Small Caps Climb
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MP092721-207x300.jpg)If you own energy, financial, small cap or value stocks, Monday was cause to celebrate.


The S&P 500 is less heavy in techs and got a boost from the energy and financial sectors. The index reduced its loss to 0.3%. IShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) rose 0.4%.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, which translated to a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the indexes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq now have five days of heavy institutional selling. That's getting dangerous.


Nine of the top 15 industry groups Monday were in the energy sector. U.S. crude for November delivery rose 2% to $75.45 a barrel. It's the highest price to settle since Oct. 3, 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**Whiting Petroleum** ([WLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLL)) and **Royal Dutch Shell** ([RDSB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDSB)) broke out past [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), adding to a stream of [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in the sector.


The Russell 2000 jumped 1.5%, easily outdistancing other indexes. Strength in small-cap financials helped offset weakness throughout the health care space.


Regional Banks Lead Stock Market
--------------------------------


Banks and financials also performed well. IBD's superregional banks group was 15th best out of 197 industries, up 3.5%. Smaller regional bank groups climbed 3% or more, thanks to rising yields.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up 2 basis points to 1.48%, and up from 1.32% last Tuesday. The 30-year Treasury bond climbed above the psychologically important 2% level for a while.


Treasury bond yields have been rising since last week, when the Fed indicated it could start unwinding its asset purchases as early as November. The Fed also suggested it could raise interest rates in 2022, earlier than expected.


Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The hearing is on the economic effects of the pandemic, but Powell could be pressed for details on the taper or interest rates.

Dow Among Higher Stock Market Indexes
-------------------------------------



The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% but was well off session highs. Financial and energy components helped the Dow outperform.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) rose more than 2% and broke out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The base flashed a 163.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) rose 0.6% and came closer to a 179.77 [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) gapped up to a 2.4% gain.


Dow consumer stocks **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) made their own breakouts, bolstering the Dow.


[Supply chain issues](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cargo-delays-are-getting-worse-but-california-ports-still-rest-on-weekends-11632648602?mod=trending_now_news_4) are back in the daily stock market conversation. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)), for example, last week [lowered its outlook due to factory shutdowns in Vietnam](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-nike-earnings-supply-crunch/).


Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, said in a report Monday that worker shortages at ports are forcing companies to work at two-thirds capacity. "A record 62 container ships are waiting at L.A. and Long Beach (ports), double the level from six weeks ago," Hackett noted.


Asian factories cut output due to Covid-19 outbreaks. And now, power shortages in China caused Beijing to set consumption limits. That figures to further limit manufacturing activity.

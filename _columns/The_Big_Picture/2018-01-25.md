Blue chips outperformed the major indexes Thursday, as the three costliest stocks in the price-weighted Dow provided significant lift.




 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.1% and the S&P 500 added 0.1%.


Volume fell across the board, blocking any chance of a distribution day.


A distribution day involves a loss in a major index in rising volume. The action points to institutional selling.


So far this year, there have been few signs of institutional selling.



Within the 30-component Dow, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) rose 2.5% in moderately higher volume; **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) gained 1.3% in heavy volume; and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) popped 1.9% in strong volume.


Boeing is up 16% so far this year, making it the hottest item in the Dow.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP012518-233x300.png)The slowdown in volume Thursday could be related to Friday's report on Q4 GDP. The data will be the first reading on Q4. The report will be released before the market's open.


The Street expects a 2.9% uptick in GDP. Estimates range from 2.2% to 3.3%. The third reading on Q3 was 3.2%.


Durable goods orders for December also could've been a reason for funds to step back and wait. This report also will be released before the open.


New orders are expected to climb 0.6%. But the range of estimates reflects uncertainty. The lowest estimate in the range is minus 1%. The highest estimate is for a 1.5% increase.



Breakouts Thursday were sparse. Those moving up in strong volume included regional bank **Cullen Frost Bankers** ([CFR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CFR)), **Varian Medical Systems** ([VAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VAR)) , cloud-based e-commerce platform provider **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and spice and herbs provider **McCormick** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)).


On the downside, chipmakers, chip designers and chip-equipment providers took hard hits. RV makers skidded sharply, as **Winnebago** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) and **Thor** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) lost 8% and 3.5% respectively. There was no news to explain either the chip or the RV losses.


Meanwhile, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sagged almost 2% in heavy volume as it knifed under its 50-day line. Some market watchers blamed concerns over sales of the iPhone X.


Financial News
--------------


Economic reports were mixed Thursday.


On the positive side, first-time jobless claims rolled in at 233,000 vs. estimates for 240,000. The prior reading of 220,000 was revised to 216,000.


Leading indicators for December were stronger than expected, up 0.6% vs. views for 0.5%.


The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index hit 16 vs. estimates for 14. Positive readings point to growth, while a rating of zero is neutral.


On the negative side, new home sales in December came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000, below the lowest estimate in the range. The consensus view was for 680,000. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/-ishares-us-home-const-itb.htm)) exchange-traded fund dived 2%.


The building sector rose 51% last year. Going into Thursday's session, the building sector was up 3.07% so far in 2018. Only eight of 33 sectors are doing worse. The No. 2 rating the building sector had as of Wednesday's close is mainly because the rankings include fundamentals. But a look at the price action alone suggests rotation is underway.

  Stock Market Ends Mixed As Energy Stocks Strengthen; Palo Alto Networks Gives This Timely Investing Lesson

The rise in stock market volatility during earnings season is something that IBD readers have come to expect. And this week has been no exception, even four weeks after the late-January peak in quarterly reports dished up by S&P 500 firms.




In some cases, the instinct to sell quickly and at the open can pay off. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) Wednesday reaffirmed the importance of a quick decision. Yet it also sometimes pays to see how the major indexes and leading companies in the stock market finish — even if the opening minutes or even first hour look crummy.


Did Wednesday's stock market argue this case? One might say yes.


The S&P 500 edged up 0.1% on Wednesday to 4,981. Even if it turned out to be a puny gain, it compares favorably with the session low of 4,946, when the large-cap index fell more than 0.6% intraday. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average halted a two-day losing streak, up 0.1% to stay firmly in positive territory for the year.


A big spike in natural gas futures on Wednesday after a huge drop from the peak in August 2022, plus another solid gain in crude oil futures, boosted energy stocks. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, six of the seven top performers hailed from the oil and gas sector. Coal tied for first on the day, up 2.9% together with U.S. oil and gas producers.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP012124-198x300.jpg)Angst over quarterly earnings results made it seem early in the stock market action that techs would get pummeled again.


Put another way, the Nasdaq maintained at least some poise, even after IBD's current outlook got a downward revision to a 60%-80% weighting in stocks from 80%-100% on Feb. 12. At 15,580, the Nasdaq composite fell for the third day in a row yet remains just 3% below a 52-week high of 16,080.


Volume cooled on both main exchanges vs. Tuesday.


Small caps also underperformed.


An early 1.1% slip by the Russell 2000 narrowed into a loss of less than 0.5%. However, midcap stocks joined the S&P 500 in the green. The SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) rose almost 0.3%.


With the S&P 500 racking up [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) over a rolling 25-session time period (see the accompanying Market Pulse), and the Nasdaq getting pounded with a 1.8% sell-off on Feb. 13 on hotter-than-expected January consumer prices, it certainly made sense to lighten exposure to stocks in recent days.


Another reason why IBD's recommended exposure level got cut to 60%-80% on that tough decline on Feb. 13? High-quality breakouts by growth companies had been thinning fast.


Plus, the progress made by some tech stocks in their recent breakouts has turned suspect.

More Round Trips To Come?
-------------------------



**MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), an expert in database development, offers a new example.


More than two weeks ago, on Feb. 2, the stock jumped 6.6% in accelerating volume. Shares rose past a trendline entry within the base near 425. The next five trading sessions looked great.


By Feb. 9, MongoDB had stretched its gain to around 19%. However, the recent slide forced new buyers to defend the gain and avoid a full round-trip of an excellent short-term profit.


So, the way the key benchmarks of the stock market closed made Wednesday's session even more important.


The Stock Market In July And August: A Contrast
-----------------------------------------------


From a technical point of view, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 continue to gain support at or near their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). And their 21-day lines have been rising bullishly since early November. A healthy 21-day moving average implies that the trend in stock prices is up over a roughly one-month period.


The Dow Jones is no exception. On Wednesday, it found support at the 21-day line as well.



Check out a long-term daily chart of the Nasdaq. At the start of August, the 21-day exponential moving average crested and began to fall. Over the next three months, the 21-day line also etched a series of lower highs and lower lows. That's a textbook explanation of a downtrend.


Going back in time, the Nasdaq logged five distribution days over a 25-day span on Aug. 2, spurring a downgrade in IBD's market outlook to "uptrend under pressure." Eleven trading days later, the composite continued to see heavy sell-offs in higher volume pile up. By Aug. 16, the Nasdaq's distribution-day count ballooned to nine. A day later, the outlook got another downgrade to "market in correction" — or the time to raise gobs of cash, lock in profits and sit on the sidelines.


Wednesday's stock market action was all the more remarkable in light of the fact that long-dated interest rates went up again. Higher interest rates can make bonds turn more attractive, steering more dollars away from equities.


The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year note rose 5 basis points to 4.32%, its highest close since Nov. 30, according to Cboe data. Year to date, the 10-year yield has jumped nearly half a percentage point, from 3.86% at the start of 2024.

Lesson from Palo Alto
---------------------



Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks' 28% thrashing in massive volume gave another reminder of how wildly stocks can trade after earnings. Palo Alto's sharp drop also highlighted the importance of a company's fundamentals and paying attention to a deceleration in growth.


Compared with most companies in the stock market, the network security firm's [39% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/panw-stock-palo-alto-earnings-q42023/) to $1.46 per share on a 19% rise in sales to $1.98 billion looks quite good. Yet it also marked the third quarter in a row of slowing profit growth. A sharp slowdown in earnings growth over multiple quarters can act as a sell signal.


From the quarter ended in July 2022 through the quarter ended in July 2023, Palo Alto's earnings had bulged 51%, 51%, 81%, 83% and 80% vs. year-ago levels. But in the October-ended fiscal first quarter, profit growth decelerated to 66%, ahead of this past quarter's 39% gain.


Meanwhile, the most recent quarter's 19% sales increase was the smallest year-over-year gain in at least eight quarters. Over that time frame, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based firm's top line had grown 24% to 27% five quarters in a row. But in the October quarter, sales increased 20%. At the time, management noted some clients were delaying purchases and renewals of services.


Down more than 28% for the week, the large-cap tech faces a critical test for holders at the 40-week moving average. It's given back all the gains from a late-November breakout at 265.90.


**Photronics** ([PLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAB)) offered the same lesson as Palo Alto Networks.


Photronics stock acted great after it broke out of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) at 26.98. But the rally didn't last. [Taking gains as the stock advanced 20% to 25% from the breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) proved a great trade. On Wednesday, the stock tanked nearly 14% in huge volume on quarterly results. Earnings accelerated to a 20% rise in the January-ended quarter, but 2% revenue growth does not fit the model of a true stock market leader.


PLAB fell for a third straight session and completely surrendered a precious post-breakout gain from the 26.98 buy point. That's a sell signal, as was the break of the 50-day moving average.


[Taking gains on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) remains a vital lesson in the stock market for all individual investors.

Nasdaq Fights To Cut Losses; Will This Sector Crash The Bull Market?
=====================================================================

For growth stock investors, what was the most interesting development of the day?




Was it the unveiling of new iPhones and a [next-generation Apple Watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphones-media-event/) from market leader and [former Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))? The sharp drop by most semiconductor shares? Or the hearty appetite for commodities and defensive companies? (Think tobacco firms, oil and gas explorers, coal miners.) How about the quiet surge in some blue chips in the Dow Jones industrial average?


The answer, of course, lies in part with what are your druthers, stockswise. But overall, this could be a strong candidate: The Nasdaq composite suffered yet another distribution day, but it was perhaps as harmless an institutional sell-off as it gets.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MP_6x5_091218-211x300.jpg)The Nasdaq, off a little more than 0.2% in slightly higher volume Wednesday, chalked up its sixth day of distribution, or clear sign of unusually strong professional selling.


However, "strong" is about as clear cut as "strong coffee." Why?


For starters, consider that the tech-fortified index had dropped as much as 1.1% intraday. So for the stock bulls, it's far better for the index to finish high up within the day's range rather than at the lower end.


Ditto for the S&P 500, which in fact reversed off its morning low to edge up 1 point by day's end. News reports quoting anonymous sources that the U.S. is interested in fresh trade talks with China helped spur the midday rally.


Technically speaking, IBD defines a distribution day as a decline of at least 0.2% (no rounding up) in volume that's higher than the prior session. On Wednesday, volume certainly came in above average, but it merely inched up vs. Tuesday's total.


Six distribution days for the Nasdaq over the past 25 trading days may be a concern for some IBD readers. And indeed it would be, if many of those sell-offs had teeth. The past two weeks have actually seen a clustering of distribution, too. From Aug. 30 to Wednesday, the market has now seen four distributions in the span of nine trading sessions.


However, only one of those four drops showed real bite — the 1.2% sell-off on the Nasdaq Sept. 5.


The average drop among the other three distribution days? A mild 0.23%.


The Nasdaq was actually not the day's worst performer. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.3%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, an important industry sector gauge, dropped nearly 1.2%. If you only paid attention to **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), you might have thought the sector had a good day.



Advanced Micro, up 7% in double normal volume on Wednesday to 32.21, has scorched both the fabless semiconductor industry group and the market with a 213% year-to-date gain. Shares have also more the doubled since rebounding off the 10-week moving average at 15.84 during the week ended July 27, [triggering a follow-on buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Will This Sector Unleash The Bear?
----------------------------------


The ghost of Lehman Brothers, which went belly up 10 years ago and helped spark further sell-offs during the Wall Street banking crisis of 2008, has reared its head across a sea of print and digital media. Individual investors are openly wondering about whether the next crisis will be rooted in the country's lenders, in the regular federal budget deficits, or in the massive total government debt load accumulated over decades.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond finished Wednesday's trade at 2.97%, up 51 basis points from Jan. 2.


Fed funds traders, meanwhile, currently see a 95% probability that short-term interest rates will rise a quarter point at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's Sept. 25-26 meeting and a nearly 82% chance that another 25-basis-point hike will take place in December. Right now, the fed funds rate is targeting a range of 1.75%-2%, up from a multi-generational low of 0.25%-0.5% back at the end of 2015.


It's good to think about anniversaries, even the negative ones. However, new regulations have forced the biggest lenders to boost their capital ratios. Runaway leverage stories are not dominating the news landscape. Unlike the sudden dry-up in liquidity among big banks in 2008 that resulted in the demise of Washington Mutual, Bear Stearns, Wachovia and Merrill Lynch as separate entities, lenders generally are showing healthier balance sheets.


And the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it doesn't want to jack up the cost of money too soon, too fast.



Superregionals, paced by a 2.4% drop by **SVB Financial** ([SIVB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIVB)), had a bad day on Wall Street. IBD's superregional banks industry group slid 2.2% on a price-weighted basis and undercut the 50-day moving average. However, the group is having a decent 2018, up 12.5% since Jan. 1.


SVB, which targets startups and technology customers in Silicon Valley, has been bumping its head hard against the 330 price level. Yet its uptrend is still intact.


Most semiconductor stocks are clearly under selling pressure and forming bases. This sector certainly helped the equity bulls run right over the bears in 2016 and 2017. But what if they don't come back strong in the future?


On a daily and weekly basis, IBD readers can learn a lot about the market trend by focusing on which broad sectors are driving the bus and which ones are dragging their feet.


Leading Sectors In The Bull Market
----------------------------------


Looking at the current rankings, software, medical, retail, consumer and business services stocks still look positive. In fact, these sectors rank the highest among 33 tracked in IBD's [stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-sep-11-2018/).


A few defensive sectors are now in the top third.


The Finance sector ranks a middling No. 16 through Tuesday's close; banks rank No. 20 and the S&Ls are in the caboose at No. 29.


[Bullishness among stock newsletter writers](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) edged down to 57.7%. Bearishness rose to 18.3%.

Stocks Meander After Easter Holiday, Ending Mixed In Soft Trade
================================================================

A quiet day of trading Monday saw stocks finish mixed and mostly unchanged after the Easter holiday.


The Dow added 0.1%, the S&P 500 rose less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq eased 0.1%. Volume fell from Thursday’s light levels. European stock markets were closed Monday, which probably had something to do with it.


The Russell 2000 and IBD 50 each added 0.1%.


![MP032816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP032816-184x300.jpg)A solid upward revision to Q4 GDP growth on Good Friday didn’t stir much excitement, perhaps offset a bit by personal income data released Monday that showed more softening of income growth in February.


On the NYSE, advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners. The ratio was flip-flopped on the Nasdaq.


Airlines outperformed Monday thanks to a big move by **Virgin America** ([VA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VA)). The airline is close to clearing a 15-week consolidation with a 39.30 buy point. Its recent move has been fueled by takeover rumors. After soaring 13% last week, the stock rose 10.3% Monday after Bloomberg reported that the airline has received takeover bids from **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) and **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)).


Discount retailers also performed well. After completing a three-weeks-tight pattern last week, **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) jumped 2.5% after Stifel raised its price target to 110 from 90.


It’s not just Dollar General that’s holding near highs and showing resilience. There are plenty of other top-rated names in the same boat. One would expect that during a confirmed uptrend. In many cases, though, stocks are treading water amid generally slack institutional buying demand.


To see what tepid buying demand looks like, check out a chart of **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)). It has been trying to clear a cup-with-handle base to no avail. Meanwhile, names like **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **Gibraltar Industries** ([ROCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROCK)) are also trying to clear bases, but big buyers have steered clear so far.


Stocks like **Fortune Brands** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are holding above buy points, but volume has generally been light in these names as well.


Despite the fact that the market is in a confirmed uptrend, it’s not a time when growth investors should be actively adding aggressive growth companies to their portfolio. The Nasdaq 100 is getting resistance so far at its 200-day moving average, which is a key test for the market at the moment. The Nasdaq is just below its 200-day line, currently around 4,865.

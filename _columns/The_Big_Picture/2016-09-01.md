U.S. stock indexes battled near the break-even line Thursday as the market awaited Friday's payrolls report.


The Nasdaq reversed higher to a 0.3% gain after being down 0.5%. The S&P 500 was almost flat after paring losses, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.1%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index led with a 0.9% pop.


The IBD 50, a list of top stocks in fundamentals and chart characteristics, rose 0.4%.


Volume fell across the board, reverting to the below-average trend on the NYSE and confirming the trend on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq has checked in with below-average volume for 19 consecutive sessions. The NYSE posted above-average volume Wednesday but then went back to slow turnover Thursday.

The last up day of 1% or more will turn 4 weeks old Friday. Down days also haven't come in big chunks. This leaves individual investors mulling over sometimes flimsy evidence.


The S&P 500 could provide stronger testimony. The big-cap index has slouched to within 1% of its 50-day moving average. A bounce off that line would be encouraging, but tests of the 50-day average in May and June ended by taking the index closer to the 200-day line.


The Nasdaq has been stuck in trading range since early August. Support appears to be set just under 5,200. Resistance is showing up near 5,275.


Several top-rated stocks rose confidently Thursday.


Chinese internet portal **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) thrust 3% in heavy volume, notching a new 52-week high.


Chip designer **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) advanced 2% in above-average volume, falling just short of retaking its 50-day line. The stock has been consolidating since late July.


Off-price retailer **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) glided 1.7% to a new closing high. Volume was 86% above average.


On the downside, **Grupo Supervielle** ([SUPV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUPV)), a May IPO, reversed under a buy point at 14 after closing above the entry Wednesday. Earnings at the Argentine bank are expected to shrink 16% this year and then rebound with 52% growth next year. Grupo Supervielle is a turnaround candidate, and for that matter so is the entire country of Argentina. The new president, Mauricio Macri, is more free-market oriented than his predecessor and is pushing for economic changes.


Another Latin American stock, **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), added 1% after Wednesday's 3% gain. MercadoLibre is based in Argentina but gets more revenue from Brazil than from its home nation. Brazil also is struggling to overcome an economic mess.


Two U.S. stocks reporting quarterly results headed south in after-hours trade. Retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) plunged more than 8%. The company missed the Street's target on revenue and offered cautious guidance. Firearms maker **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) also reported results, beating views on earnings and revenue. The stock was down slightly in after-hours action.


Economic news was a mixed bag Thursday. In China and the U.K., manufacturing data for August was stronger than expected. In the U.S., the August factory data were weaker than expected.


On Friday, nonfarm payroll numbers will be released before the open. The Street expects 175,000 jobs but the range of estimates runs from 125,000 to 215,000, according to Econoday.

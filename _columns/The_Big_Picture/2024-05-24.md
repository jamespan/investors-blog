The stock market bulls fought back on Friday even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week lower. New inflation data and the release of the Fed's Beige Book are among noteworthy events ahead in the shortened Memorial Day week.




The Nasdaq composite dusted itself off from Thursday's downside reversal to gain 1.1% Friday. This allowed it to turn in a weekly gain of 1.4% and post a new closing high. It has now risen for five weeks in a row and is up nearly 13% so far in 2024. The tech-heavy index is more than 4% above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) — a bit stretched.


The S&P 500 ended the session with a 0.7% lift but treaded water for the week. It is clear of its 50-day line and the shorter-term [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). While the benchmark index now lags the Nasdaq, it is still up more than 11% for the year.


Advancers led decliners more than 2-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and nearly 2-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in a nominal gain but was essentially flat for the day. However it suffered its first down week in five as it shed 2.3% for the week. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) fared best Friday in the Dow, while **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) enjoyed a dead cat bounce as it ended the week down 5.6%.


Small caps ended the week lower despite the Russell 2000's Friday lift of 1%. The fact it found support at the 50-day line was encouraging. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF's ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) 2.2% pop Friday underlined outperformance among growth stocks. The ETF topped the 28.35 buy point of a cup base.


PCE Inflation Data, These Earnings Ahead
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP052424-272x300.jpg)It will be a shortened week due to the stock market closing Monday for the Memorial Day holiday, but it is still a noteworthy one for economic data.


The Fed's Beige Book, which compiles evidence on economic conditions from the 12 Federal Reserve districts, [is due Wednesday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). There will also be a smattering of Fedspeak, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and New York Fed President John Williams among those making public appearances. Additionally, advanced retail and wholesale inventories data drops Thursday.


But the banner event is the release of Personal Consumption Expenditures data for April on Friday. This is key given rising fears among investors that inflation could be reigniting. Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is seen rising 2.8% year over year. Headline PCE is expected to be up 2.7% on an annualized basis. A sharper-than-expected drop would help sooth worries over interest rates.


And while earnings season has passed its peak following **Nvidia**'s ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) blowout results, noteworthy reports still lie ahead. Dow Jones stock **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), clothing retailer **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) and [Leaderboard restaurant stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) are [all on deck in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/crm-stock-earnings-cava-abercrombie-viking-earnings/).


These Stock Market Groups Flex Muscles
--------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mostly positive](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and communication services were the strongest areas, while health care was the only sector that fell.



The relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups gave investors a deeper insight into the day's trading.


Solar plays, alternative energy stocks and computer hardware companies were among the best performers. Many mining stocks made new highs Friday.


Shoe stocks also performed well following a strong quarterly report from **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), with the Ugg parent soaring out of a cup-with-handle base.


In contrast, enterprise software firms, managed care companies, water utilities and outsourcing firms all struggled [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).

The Nasdaq composite led the stock market rally Thursday, as Treasury yields continue to cool off. The S&P 500 hit a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended slightly higher.




The 10-year Treasury yield fell for the third straight day, to about 1.63%. On March 30, the 10-year Treasury yield hit a 14-month high at just over 1.76%.


The Nasdaq rallied 1% Thursday. The S&P 500 moved up 0.4%, while the Dow 30 rose 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 snapped a two-day slide with a 0.9% rise.


Leading growth stocks also outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.3%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 4-ranked **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) is trading just below an early entry around 63 from a trend line. Lovesac [was featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-retail-leader-lovesac-stock-approaches-new-buy-point/) in this week's [IPO Leaders](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/) story.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


On March 31, the Nasdaq [staged a bullish follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rally-boosted-tech-stocks-sp500-record-high-dow-jones-leader-microsoft-buy-point/), as tech stocks finally rotated back into favor. Through Thursday, the Nasdaq rallied more than 4% from the closing price on March 31. During that time frame, the Nasdaq regained its key 50-day line and moved above resistance around the 13,600 level. The tech-heavy composite is at its highest level since Feb. 19. It is now about 2% from prior highs.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 set more record highs Thursday.


Amid the recent action, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have both seen their [distribution-day counts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) dwindle. The S&P 500 carries two days, while the Nasdaq's count is now at one, which is considered a very light amount. (The March 18 distribution day on the Nasdaq is no longer relevant after the index rose more than 5% above that day's close.)


With low levels of institutional selling, investors should feel more confident in buying stocks breaking out past new buy points.

Stocks To Watch: Nvidia, Square, Align, Sea
-------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is rapidly moving up the right side of a cup base, which currently shows a 615 buy point. Be on the lookout for a potential handle to offer a lower buy point. Shares gained 1.2% Thursday.


Per Leaderboard commentary, "The previous base had multiple flaws, including a weak RS line. The latest base was third stage, but because the current base undercut that prior pattern, the base count has reset. The stock is finally above its 50-day line."


**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) advanced 5.4% Thursday, extending a win streak to seven sessions and approaching a 283.29 buy point in a cup base. This week, shares broke out above a trend-line entry around 242.

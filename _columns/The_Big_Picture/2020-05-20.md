So much for a weak close for the stock market Tuesday.




Major stock indexes scored solid gains Wednesday and ended near session highs, helped by another bullish rally in semiconductor stocks. Top-performing chip stocks in the Nasdaq 100 included **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)). The common bond among all four? They all topped buy points.


Analog Devices cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 114.16 buy point. Before the open, the [chipmaker reported its sixth straight quarter of declining earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/analog-devices-earnings-q2-2020-adi-stock/). But Wall Street instead focused on a [solid outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/analog-devices-earnings-q2-2020-adi-stock/).


ASML, featured in Wednesday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/asml-stock-gaps-up-above-buy-point/), gapped out of a consolidation with a conventional entry of 319.32; group peer KLA cleared a 117.27 buy point and Intel topped a 62.23 entry.

Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite took out Tuesday's high with ease, rising 2.1%. As noted in the latest [Weekend Market Update](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-update-raging-bull-passes-first-test/), the Nasdaq passed a key test last week with a solid bounce off its 21-day exponential moving average. Now, the index has its sights set on its all-time high of 9838 set in February. It was another accumulation day for the Nasdaq, with volume coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.


The release of Federal Reserve minutes from prior Fed meetings has moved markets in the past, but that wasn't the case Wednesday. The Fed is in a holding pattern for now after implementing $3 trillion in lending and liquidity programs to support the economy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear the Fed will do more, if needed, to support the economy.


The S&P 500 rallied 1.7%, but it's about to face a key test at the 3000 level, which basically corresponds to its 200-day moving average. It wouldn't be surprising to see the S&P 500 get turned away at the 3000 level. That can happen when an index tries to conquer a big round number like this.


But the stock market uptrend [confirmed by the S&P 500 on April 2](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) has a lot going for it, so it might not be a tall order for the benchmark index. The 9000 level was a potential resistance level to watch for the Nasdaq, but the leading index powered above it with relative ease.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.5% as it approaches the 25,000 level. NYSE volume fell slightly from Tuesday.



The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up 3%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) is in position for a breakout try over its April 29 high of 136.85.


Leaders Acting Well
-------------------


With a light [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, there's still plenty to like about the confirmed uptrend. Leading growth stocks have been pillars of strength, with several strong performers like **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Bandwidth** ([BAND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAND)), **Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) trading tightly near highs after breakouts.


Two solid earnings reports in the [retail sector](http://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news) from **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) fueled positive sentiment early in the session. But both stocks faded from early gains despite big earnings and sales beats and strong digital sales. E-commerce sales at Target soared 141% year over year. Lowe's digital sales jumped 80%.


Headed into Wednesday, the retail sector ranked No. 9 out of 33 sectors ranked by IBD based on a combination of fundamental and technical factors. Internet retailers like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) have been performing well.

China-based Alibaba and JD.com came under pressure Wednesday after the [Senate passed legislation that could ban Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. exchanges](https://www.investors.com/news/alibaba-stock-falls-senate-bill-risks-us-listings-chinese-stocks/). But both stocks rallied off lows. Alibaba reports earnings Friday before the open. It's holding just above a 216.20 buy point.


FANG Stocks On The Move
-----------------------


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) followed through bullishly after Tuesday's breakout from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) base. The buy point was 215.38. Late Tuesday, Facebook introduced Facebook Shops, where small businesses will be able to sell their products online.


Fellow [FANG stock](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), the parent company of Google, is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 1,415.63 buy point. Amazon scored an all-time high as it tries to move above the 2,500 level. Amazon was raised to a full position on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Tuesday.

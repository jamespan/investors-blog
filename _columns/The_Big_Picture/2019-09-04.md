title: Stock Market Cheers Hong Kong News; Nasdaq Jumps 1.3%

The stock market got a lift Wednesday, helped by a 3.9% pop in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index overnight. The session yielded a decent crop of technical breakouts from the likes of **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)), although the latter two came in light volume.




Sentiment was positive in Asian markets after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam formally withdrew a controversial extradition bill that resulted in weeks of sometimes violent protests in the key Asian financial hub. The bill would've allowed extradition to mainland China.


The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 1.3%, and the S&P 500 rallied 1.1%. The S&P 500 was helped by strength in oil and gas stocks, which benefited as U.S. crude oil futures jumped 4.3% to $56.26 a barrel. The Dow Jones picked up 0.9% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index rose 0.85%.


But solid gains for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite came in lower volume. It was a tough comparison, though, after Tuesday's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP090419-264x300.jpg)The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rallied 2.8%, helped by a day of outperformance for chip-equipment stocks. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) broke out of a [base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) with a 218.59 buy point. Other top-rated stocks are working on bases, including **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **Entegris** ([ENTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENTG)).


IBD's enterprise software group popped 2.5% early, but the gain faded to just over 1%.


Is Rangebound Stock Market Ready To Run?
----------------------------------------


Renewed signs of accumulation, or higher-volume price gains, would help the market's cause a lot right now. Problem is, there haven't been many of them lately.


Since Aug. 15, the Nasdaq has risen 1% or more five separate times but doesn't have much to show for it. Just one of those gains, on Thursday, came in higher volume, but volume was only 1.69 billion shares, well below its average daily volume at the time of around 2.07 billion.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still stuck in trading ranges that started in early August. That's not a bad thing, but rangebound markets are tough to navigate, with big gains one day followed up by losses the next. If you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're not alone. Without an edge, it makes sense for growth investors to selectively nibble at stocks, while maintaining a cash position to soften the blow during harsh down sessions like Tuesday. Reflecting this mixed picture, IBD's market outlook remains "uptrend under pressure."


Waning Economic Optimism
------------------------


The stock market held up relatively well despite a new reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index that showed a big dive in the near-term [U.S. economic outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/us-economic-outlook-hits-3-year-low-amid-china-trade-war-dow-jones-ibdtipp-poll/) to a three-year low. The broader IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index hit a seven-month low but remains in slightly optimistic territory at 50.8.


The new IBD/TIPP poll data comes after a [weak reading from the ISM Manufacturing index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/manufacturing-index-contracts-china-trade-war/) Tuesday. It showed contraction for the first time in three years, with a reading of 49.1.


InMode, Mastercard Break Out
----------------------------


An elevated distribution-day count is reason enough to tread cautiously with new buys. But breakout investors got an opportunity with **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) when it cleared a short [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 23.83 buy point. Shares closed at 25.27, up nearly 13%.



Actionable charts remain in short supply, but Wednesday's session served up a couple of other opportunities besides InMode. Mastercard cleared a flat base with a 283.43 buy point, and Meritage Homes topped a 66.28 entry.


In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) is finding support at the 10-week moving average as it carves a flat base. So is **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), which significantly pared a 3.9% intraday loss. Shares lagged early after the coffee retailer lowered its fiscal 2020 earnings outlook. The weak outlook came even though CEO Kevin Johnson told CNBC the company was seeing no signs of a recession and "firing on all cylinders."

Starbucks has turned into a nice winner after a breakout from a base early in the year. A flat base is still intact for Starbucks.


Earnings In Focus
-----------------


After-hours earnings reports brought sellers into shares of **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)), **Smartsheet** ([SMAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMAR)) and **Slack** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)). **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) slid initially but erased its after-hours drop.


Late Thursday, watch for earnings from **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)).

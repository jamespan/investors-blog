Stocks kicked off a shortened week of trading with small losses in light volume Monday. The Dow lost 0.2% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell around 0.1%. Volume on both main exchanges fell from Friday's levels. It's expected to be a low-volume week for the market because of Thanksgiving. The market is open for a half session Friday, closing at 1 p.m. ET.


Pockets of strength included the Russell 2000, up 0.4% and the IBD 50, up 0.1%.


In economic news, October existing-home sales fell 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted 5.36 million units, slightly below the consensus estimate of 5.4 million. Sales were held down by higher prices and low supply. Year over year, sales rose 3.9%, the lowest reading since January. The new data came on the heels of weaker-than-expected October housing starts last week.

Overall breadth was good Monday, with advancers having a slight advantage over decliners on both exchanges. Meanwhile, about one-third of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD rose 0.5% or more.


After a mild distribution phase in the major averages, indexes are back in a confirmed uptrend, helped a lot by the Nasdaq's 1.8% gain Wednesday in higher volume.


A key level for the S&P 500 to overcome is 2116, its Nov. 3 intraday high. The bulls would like to see a move above this level, preferably in strong volume, because it would constitute an upside breakout.


For the Nasdaq, the similar line in the sand is 5163.


A still-elevated distribution day count is worth noting, but the bulls don't have much to complain about these days as indexes trade near highs. A look inside the Nasdaq's six distribution days shows just two declines greater than 1%. Same for the S&P 500.


The Oct. 2 follow-through day for the S&P 500 continues to work well. Several growth names are holding gains smartly after breakouts. Several others are setting up for potential upside moves, including **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)).


Monday's session yielded one powerful breakout. **Prestige Brands** ([PBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBH)) soared 7% to 52.72. It's still in a buy range from a 50.81 buy point that goes up to 53.35. The company announced plans to buy privately held DenTek Oral Care for $225 million.

Nasdaq Leads Bullish Turn In Stock Market, But Still Must Clear These Potential Pitfalls
=========================================================================================

The Persian new year holiday, known as Nowruz, began March 20. It treats the 13th day as special. In general, folks celebrate by going to a park or verdant outdoor area and releasing bad luck. So, did the [stock market today](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) have a "lucky" Day 13 of its own?




Amid a relatively quiet day of news, particularly on the economic and banking fronts, the stock market itself seemed to make the biggest noise. For many IBD readers, this might not seem like "news." But the stock market serves as the distillation of millions of opinions with real dollars backing up those views. And this is why the major indexes can act as a harbinger for news — good or bad — three, six or nine months down the road.


Indexes rallied broadly Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq. Perhaps the spark came from a pair of encouraging quarterly reports from **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), a [bellwether of the memory-chip market](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-misses-quarterly-target/), and athleisure apparel giant **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), which issued a [promising full-year growth forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q4-lulu-stock-margins-key/).


The Nasdaq composite rose 1.8% to 11,926, finishing nearly at session highs. Volume jumped from Tuesday's bone-dry level, which in fact was the lowest turnover so far this year. No matter. The 11% increase in Nasdaq turnover vs. Tuesday, combined with the solid advance, translated into a 13th-day [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) since a new rally attempt started on March 13.



Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100, underscoring strength in nonfinancial large caps, rallied 1.9% and reached 12,846, the highest close since Aug. 25.


Stock Market Today: A Pivot Higher?
-----------------------------------


As noted in Investors.com stories for decades, a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) does not guarantee a long-lasting bull run. But IBD research on 22-plus bull and bear cycles of the stock market firmly shows that every major market bottom featured one.


The S&P 500, up 1.4% in higher volume on the NYSE, posted a Day 12 follow-through of its own. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) gained 1.2% and reclaimed the long-term 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average trailed them all, rising 1%. At 32,717, the 30-stock blue chip index still bears a 1.3% loss for the year.


You only need one index to follow through and take heed the signal to immediately freshen up your watchlist. If all or most of the [CAN SLIM traits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) exist in a watchlist name, you can then deploy some capital. But don't rush it. While the market correction meant having little exposure to stocks, Wednesday's rally confirmation means investors can raise exposure to a range of 20%-40%.


No doubt, the best follow-through days in the stock market over the past 20-plus years tended to arrive much earlier in the rally attempt. Think March 2003 or March 2009, when they occurred on Day 4 or Day 5 for either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500.


However, the follow-through on April 2, 2020, in the aftermath of the Covid-sparked waterfall decline actually didn't arrive until the eighth day of the rally attempt.


On Dec. 20, 2011, the S&P 500 soared 3% to mark a Day 17 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), more than two years after the Great Financial Crisis bear market ended. This one ushered in a solid four-month run.


Most importantly, a good follow-through features strong breakouts to 52-week or multi-month highs. It can be the latter case this time, given the super-heavy declines that hit dearly valued tech stocks in late 2021 to 2022.

Finding Stock Market Leaders Now
--------------------------------


Good places to spot emerging new leadership? Go to lists of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and rank them in terms of best gains. [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/), [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), [IBD Stock Analysis](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-analysis/) and [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) also offer excellent places to do efficient research.


Are you seeing heavy volume accompany strong price advances? Are they reversing from highs, or finishing strong? How do their weekly charts look? And how about their industry peers, particularly those with a solid [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) and [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/)? Those are some of the questions to ask as you do your research.


The biggest near-term hurdle for this emerging new rally arrives Friday with the release of fresh economic data. [Forecasters tracked by Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) see the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rising 5.1% in February year over year. While that would mark deceleration from 5.4% in January, it's still nearly a pole vault's distance above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2% inflation. The core PCE is seen rising 4.7% in February vs. a year ago, matching the January increase.



No doubt, the economy may be undergoing a rolling recession. That is, some parts of the economy are getting colder than others. Plus, confidence in the regional banking industry is still shaky. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) gained 1.1% on Wednesday, but still looks weak overall.


A sudden surge in interest rates could also crush the stock market's fledgling rally. On Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond edged up 2 basis points to 3.56%, the third straight rise. The 2-year note's yield has fallen to 4.08% from 4.40% on Jan. 3.


Watching Treasury Bond Yields
-----------------------------


Will that yield spike again? It will chiefly depend on the Friday inflation data. Yet for now, futures traders still think short-term interest rates are closer than ever to hitting a ceiling.


The CME FedWatch survey currently shows a 40% probability that the Federal Reserve will follow last week's quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate with another 25-basis-point rise to 5%-5.25% at the May 3 meeting. That's down from 49% a week ago and 73% on Feb. 28.


Another pitfall that the stock market must steer clear? Weak technicals.


The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been in a clear downtrend since peaking in late January. A hot market generates heat among a widening population of rising stocks. If the A-D line, which can be tracked via the General Market Indicators PDF at the bottom of this column, fails to rise, it would indicate the rally's underlying strength is suspect.


On Wednesday, 2,383 Nasdaq-listed companies advanced; 1,049 retreated. That compares favorably with Tuesday's statistics, in which 1,473 stocks rose on the Nasdaq while 1,965 issues fell.


On the NYSE, gainers beat losers by more than 4-1 ratio. That's exactly what you want to see under the hood of the stock market. The NYSE's advance-decline line reached a 3-week high, the same level in which Silicon Valley Bank operator SVB Financial plummeted on fears of a bank run.


Strong Gainers In 2023
----------------------


Meanwhile, stabilizing interest rates and strong overall demand for housing may help explain why the residential construction sector has emerged as an early leader so far in 2023.


IBD's residential and commercial building group took a back seat to bigger gains by stock market indexes on Wednesday. Yet on a price-weighted basis, the group has rallied 18.6% so far this year. ([MarketSmith users](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) can type in G1520 to view a chart of this industry group).


Meanwhile, semiconductors have gotten a nice boost this year, in part due to excitement about a new chapter of growth possibly led by the rollout of applications and devices that use generative AI.


The fabless semiconductor industry group (G3676 at MarketSmith) is up almost 28% since Jan. 1.


Other major movers to the upside include automakers, travel booking, cable and satellite equipment, mobile manufacturing, design software and database software.

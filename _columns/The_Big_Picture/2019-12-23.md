The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market Monday, as indexes continued a slow upward crawl that seems to mask the strength of the current uptrend.




The Dow, up 0.3%, moved on headlines and at least one breakout. **Boeing**'s ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) [CEO is out](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-ceo-resigns-amid-737-max-crisis-boeing-stock/). **Walt Disney**'s ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) latest Star Wars installment [missed lofty box-office expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-2019-box-office-record/). **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) broke out of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Disney shares sank to a five-week low. But Boeing bounced on the CEO shake-up and extended a bounce from support around the 325 price level. Intel cleared the 59.23 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a choppy base, though volume was light.


The Nasdaq rose for a ninth consecutive day. That's the composite's longest win streak of 2019, although many of those gains were minor.  In the past week, four of the five index increases measured 0.4% or less, and two were merely 0.1%. Yet, the charts of the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow look unshakable right now.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP122319-291x300.jpg)The S&P 500 added 0.1% Monday, making its eighth gain in the past nine sessions. The only decline was a minuscule 0.04% drop last Wednesday.


Volume fell sharply on the NYSE and Nasdaq — no surprise after Friday's quadruple witching caused a spike in trading. And with the Christmas holiday Wednesday, volume figures to be light the rest of the week.


Stock Market Indicators Mainly Positive
---------------------------------------


As the stock market nears the final week of 2019, indicators are largely positive and investors have reason to be confident.


The Accumulation/Distribution ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed to close last week at A- levels on a scale of A (heavy accumulation) to E (heavy institutional selling). The advance-decline line of the Nasdaq is at a 14-month high, and the NYSE's own advance-decline line is at new highs. The number of stocks with A or B Acc/Dis ratings is more than four times the number of stocks with bearish D or E ratings.


But the market could be getting frothy, judging by at least one barometer. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) fell to 0.6 Dec. 13 and even lower to 0.54 on Thursday. A level of 0.6 or lower is considered a warning sign, indicating overconfidence among investors.


Such extreme readings in sentiment can signal market tops, but keep in mind that the put-call ratio is not entirely reliable in spotting peaks. It sank to the 0.6 danger level in June and the market continued rising for several weeks. The put-call ratio has a much better track record spotting market lows. Spikes helped signal bottoms in June, August and October.


A swarm of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) often signal market tops. On that front, conditions are swiftly improving. The Nov. 20 and Dec. 3 distribution days on the Nasdaq were erased Monday thanks to gains made by the composite since then. The S&P 500 has so far not climbed enough to rid itself of distribution on the same two dates.


Is A Stock Market Pullback Due?
-------------------------------


With indexes stretching their rallies to record highs, a pullback wouldn't be surprising at this stage. The year's solid market gains could motivate portfolio managers to lock in profits in the final days of the year.



Growth stocks continue to perform well. Using a screen of stocks with an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of at least 90 that broke out in the past several weeks, we find that the average stock is 2.9% above its [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That doesn't include **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), a more speculative leader with an 81 Composite Rating that has been racing to new highs. It is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


IBD 50 on Monday lagged in a lackluster showing: It edged up 0.1%. Half the 50 stocks were lower, including financial, real estate, construction and consumer stocks.



**Winnebago** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) performed the best among [IBD 50 stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) Monday, as it followed through on its breakout past a 51.97 buy point. The stock did not rise much from most of its earlier breakouts this year, but did rally from an October [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). The latest base seems better because a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/) formed and the last base was tightly shaped.


Software leaders were mainly higher. The industry's comeback continued with **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), a big market winner since its initial breakout in February 2017, breaking out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

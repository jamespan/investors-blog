The stock market reversed from sharp gains Thursday on disappointing coronavirus drug trial news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a slight gain after advancing as much as 1.75%, as the current stock market uptrend continued.




**Gilead Sciences**' ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) experimental coronavirus drug, remdesivir, reportedly failed a [drug trial in China](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/gild-stock-dives-coronavirus-treatment-reportedly-fails-key-test/), sending the major stock indexes falling from their highs. Last week, there was [promising news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-treatment-eagle-stock-pops-hyperthemia-drug-against-covid-19/) out of the University of Chicago regarding the efficacy of remdesivir on coronavirus patients.


The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite inched lower. Leading growth stocks outperformed the major stock indexes: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) gained 0.4%. Volume on the two main exchanges rose from Wednesday's session. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 handily outperformed with a 1% gain.


Stock Market Uptrend Continues
------------------------------


With the new stock market uptrend now three weeks long (IBD [upgraded the outlook into a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/) on April 2), investors continue to see a strengthening rally with a number of strong breakouts past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). [Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-rips-higher-7-reasons-to-go-stock-fishing-now/) highlighted seven reasons to "go stock fishing." Bullishly, the Nasdaq continues to lead the current stock market rally with tech giants **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) adding to their breakout gains. On Thursday, Amazon stock rallied 1.5% on a price-target hike, while Netflix stock advanced 1.25%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP042319-228x300.jpg)Thursday's sharp reversal could indicate more short-term weakness is possible. The S&P 500 is battling with its 50-day moving average, a key resistance level. It would be quite normal — and even constructive — for the indexes to take a short breather to consolidate their recent gains. A brief respite would also allow many top stocks to add handles to their cup-base formations, offering more [risk-optimal buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


For those who believe they've missed out, remember, stocks never go up in a straight line. There are peaks and valleys along the way to solid long-term gains. Keep a close eye on [recent breakouts](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/). They can easily pull back to their [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and support levels for a second buying opportunity. Meanwhile, potential leaders — like Dow Jones stock **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — are approaching new buy points. If this current stock market rally is real and lasting, there will be plenty of time and opportunity to make money.

The coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the U.S., with confirmed cases topping 867,000, along with 48,000 deaths by Thursday, according to [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) data tracker. As the pace of growth continues to slow, investors are shifting their attention to the economic impact of the virus and the likelihood of reopening the country.

According to Leaderboard commentary, "An early entry appeared after a breakout over a trend line, but the stock has wrestled with it. The relative strength line has been tracing new highs, which is bullish."


Quarterly earnings results are due Tuesday after the close.


Apple is approaching a new buy point at 288.35 in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). Shares are just 4% away from the new entry after retaking the 50-day line on Wednesday. Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line is near new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) Thursday.


[Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/apple-stock-nears-buy-point-update-coronavirus-impact/) featured as Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Apple stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-inc-aapl.aspx) has a 94 out of a highest-possible 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the upper echelon of growth stocks. The Dow Jones tech giant is expected to report its earnings the evening of April 30.


PayPal is rapidly moving up the right side of a cup base, sporting a 124.55 buy point. The [contactless payment processor](https://www.investors.com/news/top-rated-stocks-near-buy-point-ahead-of-earnings-paypal/) is surging as consumers move away from paying at the counter amid the coronavirus outbreak.


Similar to AMD stock, keep an eye out for a potential handle to form, offering a more risk-optimal entry point. Earnings are due out after the close on May 6.



Dow Jones Leader Intel Dives On Earnings
----------------------------------------


Meanwhile, earnings season continues to be a driving force behind big stock moves. Investors will be focusing on how badly the coronavirus outbreak is impacting companies' core operations. Others, like **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), are trying to shrug off the recent crisis. Chipotle stock [jumped over 12%](https://www.investors.com/news/chipotle-earnings-q1-2020-chipotle-stock-coronavirus/), while Snap [surged 36%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-earnings-digital-ad-spending/) after recent results. Both shot up the right sides of deep cup bases.


After the close Thursday, Dow Jones chip giant **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) reported its [Q1 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-earnings-q1-2020-intc-stock/). The company topped Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but its Q2 outlook was cautious, sending shares diving 5.7% in the after-hours trading session to about 55.68.


Intel stock ended Thursday at 59.04, down 1.8%, about 5% away from a cup-with-handle's 62.23 buy point. On Tuesday, Intel's breakout above a 61.59 buy point failed when the Dow Jones stock fell more than 7% below the buy point amid that day's market sell-off.


Meanwhile, **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) jumped 4% after hours to 228, as the medical leader continues to move up the right side of a cup base with a 247.74 buy point. Late Thursday, Edwards Lifesciences reported [strong Q1 results.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ew-stock-edwards-lifesciences-earnings-q1-2020/)

Major stock market indexes ended three-week losing streaks in fine fashion Friday. Bullish earnings reports from **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) fueled positive sentiment in the technology sector.




Zscaler gapped up sharply, helped by [strong billings guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/zscaler-stock-zscaler-earnings-zs-stock-q22022/), but the stock is still 50% off its high. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) were other notable movers in the group. PANW gapped up as it forms a [cup-with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 578.89 buy point. QLYS stock hit an all-time high after finding support at its 21-day line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite gapped above the 12,000 level and retook its 50-day moving average, closing with a gain of 2.1%. Volume rose slightly on the Nasdaq but still was well below average. Advancing stocks beat decliners by around just over 2.5-to-1 on the composite.

The bullish session might've been enough to resume the uptrend, but volume has been lackluster behind the Nasdaq's three-session win streak, and the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains high for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. That's even after the Sept. 6 distribution day got nixed due to a 5% rise from that day's close. Meanwhile, a key inflation report looms large on Tuesday.


The S&P 500 also moved nicely above its 50-day line, rising 1.5%. NYSE volume fell from Thursday, but breadth was impressive, with winners beating losers by 5-to-1.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was a notable mover in the S&P 500. After finding support at its 50-day moving average earlier in the week, TSLA stock jumped above its 200-day moving average, rising 3.6%. But four straight gains have come in light volume.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index rose nearly 2%. Blue chips lagged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.2%.

The short-term overbought/oversold Nasdaq oscillator in [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) (find it under the symbol NASDQ) is near its mid-June low when the stock market bottomed. And the latest reading on market sentiment earlier in the week from Investors Intelligence showed a big drop in bullish sentiment to 29.7%. The latter is a contrarian indicator. With bullish sentiment so low, it's not surprising to see a stock market bounce.


It's a market where it makes sense to have some exposure to stocks but not aggressively â€” at least not yet.


If you're worried that you're lightly invested, don't be. You're not alone. If the stock market rally has staying power, it shouldn't be hard to find actionable stocks. We've been increasing exposure modestly on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), raising our invested percentage to around 40%.

Energy Stocks To Watch
----------------------


A slew of [cup-with-handle bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) are forming in the oil and gas sector. After a nice rally off lows Wednesday, oil and gas producer **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)) closed just below a 47.29 handle entry.


Group peer **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) is holding near its 21-day line as it sculpts a cup-with-handle base with a 75.37 entry. A decisive move above the 21-day line would give an early entry. **Denbury** ([DEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DEN)) is also pulling back in constructive fashion after soaring out of a 30-week consolidation last month.

Supply Chains Slowing Economy? This Stock Market Doesn't Mind So Much
======================================================================

The biggest week of third-quarter earnings ended with record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite despite new evidence that disrupted supply chains and higher costs are hurting many businesses.




The stock market bounced from a weak open and climbed into the closing bell. Considering the bad earnings news the market was dealt, it was remarkable that indexes performed as well as they did, let alone that they reached all-time highs.


The Nasdaq composite erased an early loss of 0.8% and closed 0.3% higher for its fifth consecutive gain. The S&P 500 climbed 0.2%. Trading was uneven — perhaps end-of-month portfolio adjustments — but the overall session was bullish. For the second straight day, indexes closed around session highs.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2% higher. The Russell 2000 lagged with a loss of less than 0.1%.

The Nasdaq rose 7.3% and the S&P 500 surged 6.9%. For both, it was the best month since last November. It's also the S&P's eighth monthly rise in the past nine months.


Stock Market Unobstructed So Far
--------------------------------


[Distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains light, inviting more exposure to stocks. But the stock market's twin nemeses of inflation and busted supply chains threaten to crash the party.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gave disappointing results late Thursday, and both cited supply chain problems. Both stocks pared losses, though.


Apple CEO Tim Cook said [component shortages cost the company $6 billion in potential sales](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-supply-chain-issues-likely-to-get-worse-this-quarter/) in the quarter. It could be more in the holiday quarter.


Amazon.com's [third-quarter sales and earnings fell short of expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-drops-on-third-quarter-earnings-report-amzn/), and the company's fourth-quarter outlook was dim. CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon expects to spend several billion dollars on labor supply shortages, increased wages, global supply chain issues, and higher shipping costs.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) plummeted to the lowest since March 5 after the coffee chain missed quarterly sales targets. It said inflation and rising employee wages will squeeze margins in the fiscal year that just started. The stock was one of the poorest-performing in the S&P 500.

Big Earnings Reports Move Stock Market
--------------------------------------


Those earnings reports capped a week that saw the five largest companies by market cap report earnings.



**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) made new highs after Tuesday evening's earnings sparked a rally. On Friday, Microsoft [became the most valuable company in the U.S.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-overtakes-apple-as-most-valuable-company-11635516976?mod=markets_lead_pos3) The software giant's market cap topped $2.44 trillion, dethroning Apple for the highest valuation. Microsoft is now extended from the 305.42 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


The IBD 50 outperformed with a 1.6% jump. Growth stocks saw favor in October, a key reason for the strong month.


But new breakouts are mixed. For example **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **TechTarget** ([TTGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTGT)), **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) have generally shown little follow-through so far. CrowdStrike finished down 0.6% for the week. Yet **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) and **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)) have already climbed the 20% from breakout points that [warrants some profit taking](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-best-sell-rule-for-growth-stocks/).


It seems that unless a top-rated stock roars past its buy point, there's no telling how far the breakout will go.

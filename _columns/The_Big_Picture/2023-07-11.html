<div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"><p>The stock market closed near session highs Tuesday, seeming confident that Wednesday's inflation report won't knock the stock market off its uptrend. Several stocks broke out, adding to a positive vibe.</p>

<p>Indexes traded higher for most of the session and accentuated the day with a burst of buying in the final 15 minutes of trading of <a href="https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/">Tuesday's stock market</a>.</p>
<p>Small caps again outperformed as the Russell 2000 climbed 1%. A couple of notes need to be made about its chart.</p>
<p>First, the Russell closed above the 1900 level for the first time since March 3 and appears to be clearing resistance at that level. Second, the index's 50-day moving average moved above the 200-day average by a few points. Chart readers recognize that as a bullish golden cross, although it is a fairly late signal.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns "><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=0RUS"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9%, with several components making bullish moves. <strong>Caterpillar</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT" target="_blank">CAT</a>) broke out of a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/">cup-with-handle base</a>, although volume was lukewarm.&nbsp; <strong>Salesforce</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM" target="_blank">CRM</a>) gapped up nearly 4% on news that <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/salesforce-stock-price-increase-9fb05b53?mod=livecoverage_web">it's raising prices</a>.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target="_blank">MSFT</a>) is trying to get support at the 10-week moving average. The company won a <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/activision-stock-jumps-as-judge-clears-hurdle-to-microsoft-buyout/">court ruling over its planned acquisition</a> of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI" target="_blank">ATVI</a>). Shares of the latter soared 10%.</p>
<p>Volume rose on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq. Gainers topped decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield eased 3 basis points to 3.98%. The benchmark yield went back below the 4% level after spending three days above it.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Direction</h2>
<p>After two days of good action, stock investors have little to grouse about. Still, the major indexes are in a sideways pattern. After rising more than 30% year to date, it may be asking too much for the Nasdaq to add an additional 5% or 10%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8519152" src="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071123-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="365" srcset="https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071123-230x300.jpg 230w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071123-786x1024.jpg 786w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071123-768x1000.jpg 768w, https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP071123.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" uia-uid="0|1">The good news is that participation continues to broaden in this market. A re-energized oil and gas sector comes as transportation, industrial, financial and consumer discretionary sectors make solid strides.</p>
<p>The number of institutional-quality stocks topping buy areas continues to expand. The IBD 50 climbed 0.6% Tuesday, as two enterprise software leaders broke out of bases.</p>
<p><strong>Dynatrace</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT" target="_blank">DT</a>) cleared a <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/">flat base</a> with a 52.99 buy point in above-average volume. The relative strength line is behaving well, also. <strong>Datadog</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG" target="_blank">DDOG</a>) closed above a 103.80 handle buy point. But its volume was lackluster, rising just 6% above its 50-day average.</p>
<p><strong>United Rentals</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI" target="_blank">URI</a>) climbed above the 450.65 <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/">buy point</a> of a cup-with-handle base. The weekly chart showed a handle form over last week. Volume in the supplier of construction equipment was weak also.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Leadership Shifts</h2>
<p>The stock market is experiencing a shift in leadership — probably for the better. Today's market is growing less dependent on the so-called Magnificent Seven and more on organic growth.</p>
<p>The big seven stocks that shouldered most of the market's gains this year are softening a bit. <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL" target="_blank">GOOGL</a>) has fallen below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft, <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA" target="_blank">NVDA</a>) and <strong>Amazon.com</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN" target="_blank">AMZN</a>) are consolidating. <strong>Meta</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META" target="_blank">META</a>), <strong>Tesla</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA" target="_blank">TSLA</a>) and <strong>Apple</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL" target="_blank">AAPL</a>) seem fine.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rest of the confirmed uptrend is getting broader participation. The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP" target="_blank">RSP</a>) is up 1.3% so far this month. The S&amp;P 500, by comparison, is down nearly 0.3%.</p>
<div class="small-12 columns medium-6 leftchart"><div class="ibd-chart-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:462px;overflow:hidden;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="ibd-chart-frame" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:99.9%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" src="https://research.investors.com/ibdchartswp.aspx?cht=pvc&amp;type=daily&amp;symbol=ne"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Using MarketSmith's screen of industry groups with the most new highs, we can get a look at leadership from another vantage point.</p>
<p>Here, you can find construction-related groups such as paints and air conditioning &amp; heating. <strong>Carrier Global</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARR" target="_blank">CARR</a>) and <strong>AO Smith</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOS" target="_blank">AOS</a>) are still near buy points. Oil &amp; gas drilling, auto dealers and contract manufacturing also have several stocks at new highs. <strong>Noble</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NE" target="_blank">NE</a>) is in buy range from the 45.50 buy point. And the chart of <strong>Cars.com</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARS" target="_blank">CARS</a>) looks bullish.</p>
<h2>Inflation Data Ahead Of Stock Market's Open</h2>
<p>Wednesday before the open, the consumer price index for June will be released. The consensus forecast is for a 0.3% increase from May and 3.1% on an annual basis. Excluding food and energy prices, economists expect CPI to climb 0.3% on the month and 5% annually, <a href="https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559231&amp;cust=ibd&amp;year=2023&amp;lid=0&amp;prev=/byweek.asp#top">according to Econoday</a>.</p>
<p>Even a surprise CPI figure may not move markets much. Fed officials have been delivering a message consistent with a quarter-point rate increase this month and another one in August.</p>
<p>Marta Norton, Morningstar Wealth's chief investment officer for the Americas, says a trend of continued disinflation should continue in the short term.</p>
<p>"The rate of inflation over the longer term remains more of an open question in our mind, as does the trajectory of Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge," Norton said in a note. Easing supply chains and labor costs coming off peaks are helping to cool inflation.</p>
<p>"Yet, for core inflation to track meaningfully lower than it is today — for example, for it to reach a 3% year-over-year rate by December — we would need to see monthly increases of 0.15% rather than the 0.4% increases we've seen on average over the past six months."</p>

The stock market ended mixed Monday as strength in energy and materials stocks helped boost the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Several technology stocks lagged in the Nasdaq 100, but the Nasdaq composite avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) due to lower volume.




The Nasdaq 100 eased 0.4%, but several high-profile technology stocks fell sharply, including **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which reported strong earnings last week. After Friday's downside reversal, AMZN stock fell an additional 2%. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) also lagged badly in the Nasdaq 100.


The Nasdaq composite erased a 0.6% early gain, closing with a loss of 0.5%. The index is clinging to support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq might've closed in the red, but breadth was OK, with advancing stocks having a slight edge over decliners. NYSE advancers topped decliners by more than 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.7%, led by a 3% gain for **Dow Inc**. ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)). The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, helped by solid gains for **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), **Valero** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)) and **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)). FCX stock is trading near an alternate entry of 39.14 after a failed breakout. Valero and Schlumberger are back above their 50-day lines as both form new [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


**![MP050321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP050321-254x300.jpg)FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) was another top gainer in the S&P 500, up nearly 5% to 304.55. It's still in the 5% buy zone after a breakout over an alternate handle entry of 294.86.


A close near lows for the S&P 500 had the look of a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the S&P 500, but volume on the NYSE was lower than on Friday, meaning the index avoided distribution. So, the distribution-day count stays the same at three each for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


Retail stocks also outperformed, including **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)), which is holding support at the 50-day moving average as it forms a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). The department store operator was added to [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com) Monday. Of the 18 retail-related groups in IBD's database, 11 ended with gains of more than 1%.


Two top performers on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Monday hailed from the retail sector: **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) and **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)). Dick's has been trending above its 50-day line after a breakout from a consolidation in early January. Williams-Sonoma is holding support near its 21-day line after gapping out of a shallow cup base in March.



In the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), retailer **Revolve Group** ([RVLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVLV)) jumped nearly 5%. It's also been getting support at its 50-day line, and a six-week consolidation shows a 55.93 buy point. Earnings are right around the corner, though, with results due Thursday after the close.


Outside of the retail sector, shipping stock **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) surged out of a short consolidation, rising 13.5%. Headed into Monday, the shipping group ranked No. 5 in IBD's 197 industry group rankings, down slightly from No. 2 six weeks ago.


Market Health
-------------


From a technical perspective, the stock market still looks fine as indexes trade near highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are still holding above their 10-day moving averages. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) is less than 4% off its high and continues to base mainly above its 50-day moving average.


The price action in the major stock indexes might look fine, but the action beneath the surface has resulted in a challenging environment for growth investors. If you haven't been in sync with the market, and your portfolio is having a hard time making headway, it doesn't make sense to be 100% invested. Cut your laggards loose and hold on to your best performers. It's OK to hold some cash at this point.

**Vizio** ([VZIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZIO)) bounced back after a failed breakout last week. The maker of smart TVs and sound bars topped a 26 buy point Wednesday but quickly triggered a sell signal when it fell more than 7% below the buy point. Shares were strong Monday after the company announced a partnership with Verizon Media to deliver new cross-platform and connected-TV advertising solutions. Vizio reports earnings next week.


Meanwhile, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is still fighting a good fight above its 50-day line. The fund halted a moderate four-session decline, rising 0.6% Monday. It's showing healthier technical action than another ETF that focuses on growth stocks. The ARK Innovation ETF ([ARKK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARKK)) lost ground for the fifth straight session, down more than 3%, as it gets resistance at the 50-day moving average.


Top gainers in the IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks included **MarineMax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)), IBD's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/hzo-stock-nears-buy-point-after-marinemax-buys-yacht-maker/). The stock on April 22 powered above its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, helped by strong earnings.

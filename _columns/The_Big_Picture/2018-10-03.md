Small Caps, Oil Stocks Pace Upside; Why 8 Nasdaq 'Sell-Offs' Haven't Stopped The Bull Run
==========================================================================================

Sometimes the market, or a set of separate financial markets, appears to flash mixed signals. Yet Wednesday's action overall gave hints that the bull run is not yet over.


While the market for long-term government bonds, highlighted by a huge sell-off in long-dated U.S. Treasuries, shouted "Risk on!" to participants around the globe, big-cap stocks seemed to carry this message: "Hey, let's not get too carried away, OK?"


The S&P 500 trumpeted the second message. An early gain of nearly 0.6% got squashed to a lift of less than 0.1% by day's end. Other indexes fared significantly better.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP_8x4_100318-202x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, losing nearly half of its early advance. Volume grew 28% vs. the prior day. But the Russell 2000 and the small-cap S&P 600 rallied 0.9% and held near session highs.


These Sectors Bolster The Bull Run
----------------------------------


Some sector indexes nearly kept apace with the small-cap gauges.


The Dow Jones transportation average jumped nearly 0.6%, extending its year-to-date gain to 6.9%. It rallied 17.3% in 2017. The SPDR Energy ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) exchange traded fund rose 0.9%. Look at its daily chart, and it's a subtle clue that numerous oil and gas explorers and integrated firms are in the middle of forming new bases, or even breaking out.


**EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)), **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), **Apache** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)), [IBD Dividend Stock Leader](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/dividend-leaders-oct-02-2018/) **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) and **Anadarko Petroleum** ([APC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APC)) are painting that picture. The average EPS estimate for 2018 for the first four stocks: up 508%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF gained 0.4%. At 37.36, the barometer for high-growth market leaders is holding a healthy year-to-date gain of 12.6%. The S&P 500, at 2925, is up 9.4% over the same time frame.


The S&P 500 recorded its fourth distribution day, or evidence of severe institutional selling, over the past 25 sessions on Wednesday. It came in the form of a rare stalling day. That is, the big-cap benchmark finished well in the lower half of the intraday range. NYSE volume grew vs. the prior session. Such price-and-volume action implies that fund managers sold heavily into the day's advance.


Stalling Days And The Bull Run
------------------------------


However, IBD research of more than 22 bull and bear market cycles has found that bull runs do not die of a rash of stalling days. Rather, you need to see big drops down, often clustering in the space of a week or two. You need to see a wide-ranging sell-off among true market leaders.


We haven't witnessed either of these factors yet, at least within the NYSE side of Wall Street.


True, NYSE-listedÂ **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) has had a rough three sessions. The cardiovascular health expert followed Tuesday's 5% gap-down in nearly double the average volume with a 3.9% drop in accelerating turnover. That sell-off gutted all of a short-term 11% rally, following a bullish Sept. 24 breakout past a 156.97 buy point past a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).



Sure enough, the cup without handle has typically harbored more risk than the well-crafted [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). One reason: As IBD founder Bill O'Neil has often pointed out, you want to be careful with those stocks that seem to move straight up from the bottom and charge into new highs. Edwards, though, didn't make a run to new highs straight up from the bottom.


Edwards was probably due for a pullback. Since Sept. 6, the big-cap member of the medical products industry group had vaulted 25% in just 17 trading sessions. That's normally the kind of gain you see in a climax run, well after the stock has already run up 200%, 300% or more. Still, the fact that all gains from the breakout vanished was a serious breakdown.


This Bull Run Is Handling High Distribution Levels
--------------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 now has four distribution days, including Wednesday's stalling day. The Nasdaq has double that number, as the Market Pulse table shows.


Yet as the daily chart illustrates, since the first of those eight down days was in higher volume than the prior session, the premier index for growth stocks has fallen a mere 0.8% from the Aug. 30 close of 8088.


Moreover, the Nasdaq continues to hold above two key levels: the 50-day moving average and the psychologically significant round number of 8000.


Meanwhile, few stocks within top lists including the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) showed names marking big sell-offs in massive trade. The Nasdaq portion of IBD's [Stock Spotlight screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) was up 27% through Tuesday's close.


With a lack of corroborating evidence that growth stocks are peaking, it bespeaks strength.


The Sell-Off In U.S. Treasuries
-------------------------------


Wednesday's session featured a huge sell-off in Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year bond's yield spiked to as high as 3.16%. That's the highest level since July 2011, when the 10-year note yielded 3.22%. A strong ADP private sector report (jobs up 230,000 in September) boded well for September's payrolls and jobless data expected on Friday.


With all that money flowing out of Treasury bonds, where will it go?


Bitcoin fell 0.7%. Gold and silver also dropped, although the precious metals have had a significant rally off their lows the past few weeks. Keep in mind that as the U.S. dollar keeps rallying against the euro and the yen, it makes gold and silver more expensive.


Crude oil remains the standout commodity. West Texas Intermediate futures rallied another 1.3% to $76.22 a barrel, stretching year-to-date gains to 26%.


Breadth was mixed on Wednesday. On the Nasdaq, winners slammed losers by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. But on the Big Board, declining stocks actually exceeded winners by 50 issues.

Here's Why Putin Is Not The Only Reason Bears Are Mauling The Stock Market; Miners Offer Silver Lining
=======================================================================================================

The stock market was given a late pasting by the bears as Russia continued to ramp up the pressure on Ukraine. But a number of factors are in play as the indexes continue to toil.




The Nasdaq composite really had its clock cleaned. It was the day's worst performer, closing down 2.6% and at new lows for the year. The index's [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) fell further below the 200-day average.


The S&P 500 fell deeper into what Wall Street calls correction territory as it slid 1.8%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its lowest level of the year so far after it gave up 1.4%.


As the stock market continues to struggle, the [IBD market outlook was shifted to "market in correction."](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) Investors should avoid all stock purchases, and raise cash by taking profits or [cutting losses](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MP022322--234x300.jpg)Small caps were also beaten down, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.8%. Growth stocks were hit even harder, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) giving up 2.5%.


Volatility continued to rise, with the [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, closing up nearly 8%. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the New York Stock Exchange, but this was the merest crumb of comfort amid the broad damage.


Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note inched up to 2%. Oil also rose, with West Texas Intermediate crude rising 0.4% to $92.24 late Wednesday.


Russia-Ukraine Hurts, These Factors Also Weigh
----------------------------------------------


The outlook on the Russia-Ukraine crisis continued to look grim. With Russian President Vladimir Putin showing no signs of backing down, the Ukrainian parliament voted to enter a state of emergency at midnight.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said U.S. sanctions leveled against Russia were "about as harsh as my disciplining my daughter when she gives me puppy dog eyes."


But he said there are a number of factors that are causing the depressed market action.


"In addition to all the geopolitical uncertainty, Wall Street will have a hard time becoming bullish until it has a clear answer on monetary policy and when inflation will peak," he said. "The Russia-Ukraine crisis will continue to add more fire to inflationary pressures, and that raises the risk of a Fed policy mistake, which is the one thing that could end most bullish outlooks on Wall Street."


As if that was not enough to give bulls pause for thought, they will also have to consider the fact companies will be experiencing decelerating profit growth as normalization returns following the Covid pandemic.

Miners Strike Gold As These Areas Shine
---------------------------------------


Miners of all stripes were the silver lining for investors tracking the top-performing industry groups.


Wednesday, the top areas included coal, gold, silver and gem miners, oil and gas explorers and producers and periodicals.


There are currently a couple of gold mining stocks near buy points. **Sibanye-Stillwater** ([SBSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBSW)) has work to do to reach a 19.84 entry. The stock's recent performance has seen it rise onto the [IBD 50's top 10.](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10)



Meanwhile, **SSR Mining** ([SSRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSRM)) is just below a cup-base buy point of 20.15. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) is also at a new high, a bullish sign. Strong Q4 results early Wednesday boosted the stock.


While it is not the time to be buying stocks, these miners are certainly two names worth adding to one's watchlist.


The lagging groups Wednesday included nonalcoholic beverage makers, wood products companies, auto manufacturers and cable and satellite service providers.


Wood products provider **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) was one of the worst performers on the stock market. It flashed multiple sell signals as it plunged nearly 21% on its latest earnings report.


Will Bear Pounce Signal Market Bottom?
--------------------------------------


The Bulls vs. Bears weekly survey of newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence can serve as a contrarian sentiment indicator. The latest report showed that bullish sentiment decreased from 33.7% to 32.2% while bearish sentiment increased from 27.9% to 31%.


When the percentage of bears crosses above the bulls, a market bottom is more likely. But with the gloomy overall picture, it remains to be seen whether investors will have to endure more pain before finally turning the corner.

It was a rough start for the stock market on the first trading day of 2024 as a sell-off in semiconductor and software stocks weighed on the Nasdaq. But the selling was less intense in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 as money rotated into health care and biotech stocks.




The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.6% but held support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The silver lining was that buyers came in during the final half of our trading and lifted the Nasdaq off lows. Breadth was surprisingly strong on the Nasdaq, with losers beating winners by about 4 to 3. But volume rose from Friday, resulting in the Nasdaq's second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/).


At one point Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite was down 2.2%, on pace for its worst first trading day of the year since 2001, when it fell 7.2%.


If you haven't done so already, now is the time to be raising some cash by taking partial or full profits in some of your big winners.

Chip-equipment leader **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) gave back more than 5%. The stock topped a 696.97 entry on Dec. 11. Shares of the Danish firm were weak after the Dutch government partially revoked an export license for two of the company's lithography systems to China. ASML gave a sell signal Tuesday with a sharp break of its 21-day line.

IBD's semiconductor equipment group was one of the day's worst performers, down more than 3%. But IBD's biotech group added around 1%, helped by fresh all-time highs for **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)).


The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF ([XBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XBI)) gained 1%. After seven straight weekly gains, XBI is trying to clear a long [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/getting-the-dub-recognizing-the-double-bottom-base-pattern/) with a 90.91 entry.


Profit-taking also hit several leading enterprise software stocks, with the group down about 3%. Top-rated stocks in the group like **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) all fell below their 21-day lines. All three stocks are still in the [Leaderboard model portfolio](https://leaderboard.investors.com), although it trimmed the Shopify and Datadog positions Tuesday.


The S&P 500 gave back 0.6% but closed off lows and above its 21-day line. Breadth was pretty good on the NYSE as well, with declining stocks only having a tiny edge over advancers. Volume rose on the NYSE, giving the S&P 500 its second straight distribution day and three total.

Health care stocks like **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE))and Amgen outperformed in the S&P 500. But cruise line operators like **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) and **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) fell sharply, along with chip giants like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)).


West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures traded as high as $73.64 a barrel, up more than 2%. But oil settled at $70.38 a barrel, down 1.8%.


Oil jumped early on reports that Iran sent a warship to the Red Sea. The move comes after the U.S. destroyed three boats of Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The Houthis have staged more than 20 attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea since November.


Dow Jones Today
---------------


The Dow Jones average fell modestly in the stock market today, helped by strong gains for Amgen, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)), **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)). But **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell more than 3%, hurt by a [Barclays downgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-downgraded-on-growth-concerns/) to underweight from equal weight. The analyst cited lackluster iPhone 15 sales, among other things.


Amgen soared out of a cup base with a 288.46 entry. Shares jumped 3% to 297.39. Verizon jumped 3% and closed near a 38.88 buy point.



Rising bond yields also weighed. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 4% early in the session after closing Friday at nearly 3.87%. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 3.94%, up 8 basis points.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), **Fifth Third Bancorp** ([FITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FITB)) outperformed with an 0.8% gain. The regional bank is showing strength and support after a breakout from a base during the week ended Dec. 1.

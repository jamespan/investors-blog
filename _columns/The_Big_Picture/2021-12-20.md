  Nasdaq Squanders Its Nascent Stock Market Uptrend; Will Other Key Indexes Hold?

The Nasdaq endured a brutal opening Monday and stepped off its session lows to avoid another steep sell-off. But the index also waved a big red flag about the chances that the latest confirmed uptrend will hold.




Off as much as 2%, the composite index whittled the morning's decline to 1.2% by day's end. But the Nasdaq didn't just trip beneath the low of its [follow-through day on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-fed-policy-decision-time-to-get-back-in/). The key index for growth stocks also briefly took out the 14,931 low of its latest rally attempt.


The S&P 500, which also triggered a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the same session as the Nasdaq, is holding above its Dec. 3 short-term low of 4495. But a gap-down in price at Monday's open and another decline exceeding 1% are not the elements of a healthy new rally in stocks.


Beating the S&P 500's drop of 1.1%: iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slumped 1.5%, while fellow exchange traded fund SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) lopped off nearly 1.7% and briefly hit an 11-week low.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MPa122021-1-221x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average made it three down days in a row. Its 1.2% decline held the blue chip index fenced in between the Dow's still rising 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slid 1.4%; intraday, the ETF accelerated its decline off a Nov. 9 peak at 52.55 to 20.6%.


Volume fell on both main exchanges. But Friday's figures got boosted by the monthly and quarterly expiration of options and futures on individual stocks and stock indexes.


As one can see in the Market Pulse, selling in leading growth stocks remains intense.


Nasdaq Today: Still A Mild Decline, But Not For Many Leaders
------------------------------------------------------------


And while only the Russell 2000 is the sole major equity index to actually fall more than 10% from its all-time high, the pullback in other indexes still masks serious carnage in companies that generated big gains earlier in the year despite having not a whiff of profits on their balance sheet.


**Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)), trying to bottom out near its 200-day moving average, **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) and **[Affirm](https://www.investors.com/research/affirm-afrm-stock-buy-now/)** ([AFRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFRM)) pose as just a few examples.



Tech companies with rich valuations in terms of their price-to-earnings ratios have been hit hard, too.


E-commerce platform **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), down 3% on Monday and undercutting the low of its latest 15-week base, still trades more than 200 times its 2022 earnings estimate of $6.10 a share.


Yet round-trip action among leading stocks, even of the industrial variety with substantial sales and earnings, has become an unpleasant reality as the fourth quarter of 2021 draws near an end.


Beyond Nasdaq: Industrial, Consumer Plays Bushwhacked Too
---------------------------------------------------------


Consider **Goodyear Tire** ([GT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GT)).



The tire giant, at 56.46, actually holds a market-beating 75% gain since Jan. 1. Yet the latest breakout past a cup with handle at 19.60 no longer shows any profits.


It took just 13 trading days for GT to rise at least 20% from the 19.60 buy point.


Normally, this would give an investor a clue that Goodyear could become a runaway leader, and thus should stay in the portfolio for at least eight full weeks.


When A Key Holding Rule Loses Relevance
---------------------------------------


But when market conditions worsen, staying flexible is key. One can sell and lock in gains before eight weeks pass and all the breakout honey gets devoured by the bears.


On Nov. 30, with six distribution days on the books in the S&P 500, IBD downgraded the outlook for stocks to "uptrend under pressure." On the same day, Goodyear briefly dipped below that 19.60 breakout point and tested the bulls' conviction at the 50-day moving average.


A 93 [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) for Goodyear still shines. But as noted in the Technical panel of [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) (see it on the right-hand panel of information in any stock chart), the Akron, Ohio, company's three-week Relative Strength Rating has nose-dived to an unpleasant 41 on a scale of 1 to 99.


The triple-leveraged Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Suppliers ([NAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NAIL)) ETF has now fallen heavily in five of the past six sessions. A daily chart shows the waterfall-like decline, taking NAIL swiftly below its 113.02 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a deep seven-month [double bottom with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).


Market breadth still showed bearish hues.


Losing stocks trampled winning ones by a nearly 3-1 ratio on the Nasdaq, and almost 4 to 1 on the NYSE.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond climbed 1 basis point to 1.41%.


Utilities also got caught in Monday's downdraft; SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) slipped 0.7% but held above its 21-day exponential moving average. One could spot a 67.94 cup-with-handle buy point in the ETF's recent chart action. Gains have reached as high as 12% in the fourth quarter. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF holds a 6.3% gain since Oct. 1.

After climbing four weeks in a row, the stock market still was not content and climbed to record highs again Tuesday.


The Nasdaq rose 0.5%. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), one of its largest components, made a sure-footed rise to new highs, albeit in slightly below-average turnover.


Amazon already had shown leadership, having risen past the buy range from a 821.75 cup-with-handle buy point, making it one of the market's [stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/?yptr=yahoo).


The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each add![mp022117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP022117-194x300.png)ed 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 had a nearly 0.8% increase, and the Dow utilities average led with a 1.1% increase. All indexes closed near session highs after they shook off a midday nap.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


All in all, it was a fine performance for the market, made all the better by the fact that many leading stocks are making industrious advances from breakouts.


In the IBD 50, which rose 0.7%, more than half the stocks are above buy points or rising from support at the 50-day moving average. Technology and financial stocks have been most productive.


Chinese internet company **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and defense electronics firm **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) are up 16% from their respective buy points of 23.96 and 32.85. **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) has moved up 8% from its 66.91 entry. Insurer **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)) is up 10% from its 73.15 buy point.


Those are good profits, and it shows that it's not just the market's stars such as Amazon, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) that are performing well, but also its bench talent.


Still, just as the leaders are progressing, the main indexes are less certain.


It's not because of distribution. Only three [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) are on the S&P 500 and five on the Nasdaq. That's an acceptable, if not normal, amount of selling by institutional investors.


What's bothersome is that the market's solid gains are precisely what could work against it. Indexes are up four weeks in a row, the longest win streak since an eight-week stretch in July and August. Back then, the market was coming up from a short-term pullback. This time, the indexes are at record highs, and more susceptible to the law of gravity.


As this column has noted, the Nasdaq is trading above a price-channel line that touched the highs going back to November. That's a sign of caution, something that could be ameliorated by the chance that the Nasdaq might be in an even longer price channel (going back to last June).


In sector activity Tuesday, retail was up after key earnings reports.


**Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), the nation's largest retailer, beat fourth-quarter earnings and U.S. same-store sales expectations. Its guidance for full-year revenue exceeded estimates, too. **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) beat sales and profit expectations. Total same-store sales rose 5.8%, also above views. But **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) earnings and sales continued to decline in Q4, and management gave cautious guidance.


Wal-Mart and Home Depot rose 3% and 1%, respectively, while Macy's reversed lower after hitting resistance at the 50-day line.


Several other sectors led, including health care, semiconductors, steel and building.


Real estate was another interesting sector because of the action in ETFs. The iShares U.S. Real Estate ([IYR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYR)) exchange traded fund climbed back above its 50-day line.Â  SPDR Dow Jones REIT ([RWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RWR)), which tracks real estate investment trusts, and SPDR Real Estate Select ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) are approaching their 50-day averages.

title: Small-Cap Growth Stocks Lead Upside; 4 Reasons Why Nasdaq May Keep Solid 2018 Gains

Apparently it just took four words uttered by President Trump to derail an attempt by the U.S. and Canada to come up with Nafta 2.0. But Friday's action on Wall Street communicated this message: It's going to take a lot more than that to derail the strength in U.S. growth stocks.




Major indexes swam within a tight range, protecting hard-fought gains in August. The S&P 500 ended the day up less than a point. But at 2901, the large-cap benchmark rose 3% for the month.


That's a terrific monthly gain. Keep in mind, too, that August included no fewer than three distribution days (declines of 0.2% or more in higher turnover vs. the prior session) on the S&P 500. But even the S&P's gain pales vs. what other important indexes did.


The Nasdaq composite, benefiting from strength in key growth sectors such as chips and retailing, hopped nearly 0.3% ahead to end the historically challenging month for U.S. equities with a 5.7% advance. The Russell 2000, up almost 0.5% Friday, jumped 4.2% higher in August. Volume fell sharply on both main exchanges.

Trump said talks with Canada are "totally on our terms." Talks are set to resume, however. Meanwhile, a business barometer index from the Institute for Supply Management in Chicago fell in August and missed the Econoday forecast.


Friday's session showed that the technical health of the Nasdaq's rally, now more than 17% since Jan. 1, remains quite strong. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line climbed to new highs this past week. From Monday to Thursday, an average 166 Nasdaq companies made new highs each day. The Nasdaq saw just two down days (Aug. 10 and Aug. 15) that came in heavy turnover during the entire month. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating remains solid.


Positive Factors For Growth Stocks
----------------------------------


Here are three more reasons why the Nasdaq, even after rallying 28% in 2017, may be poised to continue its market-leading ways.


**Trade war risk**: The potential for escalating tariffs on Chinese and Canadian imports seems to be hurting NYSE-based commodity firms more. Steel, agriculture, auto, chemical and oil stocks have lagged their software, internet and retailing counterparts.


**Leading stocks**: They continue to act well. [Nine companies remain on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), including apparel innovator **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)). After roasting Wall Street estimates for Q2, shares rose as much as 16%. **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) exited the Leaders list after stretching its breakout gain past a 115.64 entry to 34%.


**Earnings picture**: It looks good. IBD 50 companies on average are expected to grow earnings 38.5% vs. year-ago levels in the third quarter and 33% in Q4.

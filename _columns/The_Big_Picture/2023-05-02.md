Financial and energy stocks led a rout on Wall Street Tuesday as stock market indexes are snapping out of a period of quiet action into a new phase of volatile trading.




Indexes pared losses but still closed more than 1% lower.


The Nasdaq composite lost 1.1%, though it held above the 12,000 level. The S&P 500 shed nearly 1.2% but remains above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%. Resistance around the 34,000 level showed its power after Tuesday's loss.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, adding [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Small caps got pummeled, dumping the Russell 2000 more than 2%. The IBD 50 Index fell 1.5%. **AristaÂ  Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) dented the index as cautious comments by the company's CFO triggered a nearly 16% plunge in the stock. **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) and **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) fell 10% in the IBD 50.


Stock Market Awakens From Quiet April
-------------------------------------


Stock market indexes spent most of April in the doldrums, rarely gaining or losing more than 1% on any given day. But that's changed in the past week. The Nasdaq has moved 0.4% to 2% in five of the past six sessions. The S&P has moved more than 0.8% in five of the past six sessions.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP050223-199x300.jpg)Despite higher volatility, the indexes remain in more or less horizontal price ranges. Yet, volatile behavior indicates uncertainty in the market.


This comes as the stock market awaits Wednesday's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.


Most traders expect a quarter-point interest rate hike, but the big question is what happens next. Will the Fed make a long-awaited pause in tightening? Some softening economic data and a banking crisis with no clear endgame should motivate the Fed to stop hiking rates.


Odds for another rate hike at the June Fed meeting are zero, while about 18% expect a rate cut, according to [CME Group's FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html). Odds for a cut in the fed funds rate keep rising with each subsequent Fed meeting this year.


The bond market does not expect much more tightening, and may even be pricing in a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield fell nearly 14 basis points to 3.43% in the largest single-day drop since March 17.


Banks Sell Off As Worries Persist
---------------------------------


On Wednesday, however, the stock market focused on worries that have surfaced more recently.


Investors had a muted response Monday after regulators seized **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) won the bidding for most of its assets. But a day later, banking stocks were routed.


The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) and SPDR S&P Bank ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) broke below support levels. Both fell to the lowest levels since autumn of 2020.


Some regional banks were hit hard, including **PacWest** ([PACW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PACW)) (down nearly 28%), **Western Alliance** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) (off 15.1) and **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)) (down 10.8%).


ISS Market Intelligence VP Alan Hess told IBD this year's failures of SVB, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank remain a weight on investors.


"This has renewed concerns that the banking crisis from mid-March still remains a very present concern," he said in an email.


Investors have been known to flee stocks when banks face a crisis. Right before and following the SVB collapse, U.S. equity funds saw net outflows of around $14.3 billion, according to ISS research. At the same time, money rushed into money market funds at the highest rate since the Covid crisis.


Energy Sector Also Weighs On Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


Financials weren't Tuesday's worst sector. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) fared the worst, down more than 4% as it broke below its converged 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


The sector slid as U.S. crude oil tumbled more than $4, or 5.3%, to $71.66 per barrel. It was the largest one-day decline since Jan. 4, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The oil drilling, oilfield services, oil & gas integrated and U.S. exploration and production industry groups fell 4.7% to 5.6%.


Stock Market Enters Weak Period
-------------------------------


Adding to concerns, the stock market is entering the worst seasonality of the year. The May-through-October period generally has had the weakest performance going back to 1950.


The May-through-October period averages a 1.7% S&P 500 gain, according to LPL Financial research. The best six-month period historically happens November through April, when the S&P rises an average of 6.9%.


Since 1950, the S&P 500 has climbed a miserly 0.2% on average in May. But the trend appears to be moderating or even shifting. May ended with gains for the S&P 500 in nine of the past 10 years, including surges of better than 10% in 2020 and 2021.


"Also, consider that this seasonally weak period has actually been quite strong in recent years. In fact, stocks gained during this seasonally weak six-month period in nine of the past 11 years," LPL strategists Jeffrey Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist wrote in their report.

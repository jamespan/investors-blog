  Stock Market Shows Signs Of Softening; Techs Lead, But Apple Hits Major Indexes

The Nasdaq had its first drop in seven sessions Tuesday, as Treasury yields jumped amid questions on the interest-rate outlook. And with the stock market entering earnings season, its direction has become less clear as the market's uptrend seems to be looking for momentum.




The Nasdaq fell not quite 0.2%. It is meeting resistance around the 15,000 level after failing to capture that round figure less than three weeks ago. The Nasdaq 100, however, was almost flat as techs were the only S&P sector index to rise Tuesday.


The S&P 500 lost 0.4%. The index is holding above its 21-day exponential moving average. At the same time, the 4,800 level is acting as a potential ceiling.


Small caps continued to struggle in the new year. The Russell 2000 gapped down 1.2% Tuesday and is down nearly 5% so far this month. To be sure, the Russell could use a cooling off after rallying 12% in December and nearly 9% in November. The small-cap benchmark is nearing a test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/), where traders can start looking for a rebound.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, or 231 points, and made its first touch of the 21-day line since Nov. 1. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) alone cost the Dow 113 points. Wells Fargo [downgraded the aerospace company](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-downgraded-as-china-ramps-737-max-inspections/), and China deliveries face a potential delay due to new safety inspections.


Apple Hurts Stock Market
------------------------


Apple also erased some points off the Dow as it fell 1.2%. The U.S. Supreme Court [let stand a ruling on an antitrust case](https://www.wsj.com/tech/supreme-court-denies-petitions-on-apple-epic-appeals-612328f9) involving the App Store that could cost the company dearly. Also, Apple [cut prices on its newer iPhones in China](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-discounts-iphones-in-china-amid-weak-demand/), where demand is weak.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP011624_2-204x300.jpg)Apple shares, however, found support at the 200-day moving average. The tech giant no longer claims the highest U.S. market capitalization. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) closed with a higher market cap on Friday and again Tuesday.


Volume rose on the main exchanges from Friday's preholiday pace. That gave the S&P 500 its fifth distribution day in the past several weeks.


Weakness notwithstanding, the stock market uptrend remains on track. IBD's recommended exposure is still a highest-possible 80%-100%.


Yet some market internals show a softening trend, just as the stock market enters earnings season.


For example, the 10-day moving average of stocks up in volume vs. down in volume shifted to the downside in the past week or so. While there are still many more stocks making 52-week highs vs. new lows, the [up-vs.-down gap has narrowed](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-jan-12-2024/) since the year started.


The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq advance-decline lines have curved downward since late December â€” a bearish divergence from the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes. On Tuesday, decliners topped advancers by a 5-2 ratio on the Nasdaq and by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE.


Stock Market Watching Fedspeak
------------------------------


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 11 basis points to 4.06%. The move made it more likely for the benchmark yield to stay above the 4% level.


The stock market continues to harbor expectations of interest-rate cuts as early as March. In that context, any comments from Fed officials are magnified. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller said he sees current Fed policy [in the right place](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-waller-sees-rate-cuts-this-year-but-nothing-rushed-06cffcc7?mod=home-page), and sees no reason to rush into rate cuts. His comments appeared to hit market sentiment.


Still, Goldman Sachs Economics Research expects the Fed to start cutting interest rates in March, with a total of five rate cuts during 2024, chief economist Jan Hatzius said, according to Dow Jones Newswires.


Odds for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's March meeting [stood at 65% Tuesday](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html), down from 77% before Waller spoke.


Geopolitical Risk
-----------------


Up to now, the U.S. stock market hasn't fussed much about geopolitical risks. Yet more companies are avoiding the Red Sea, adding time and cost to shipments of crude oil and goods.


**Shell** ([SHEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHEL)) indefinitely [suspended shipments through the Red Sea](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/shell-suspends-red-sea-shipments-amid-fears-of-more-houthi-attacks-c7fa936d?mod=hp_lead_pos5) following attacks on oil tankers and container ships by Houthi rebels. U.S. and U.K. forces continue to strike Houthi targets. About 12% of global seaborne oil trade goes through the Red Sea, a passage connecting the Suez Canal and the Arabian Sea.


Shares of sea-cargo companies climbed Tuesday after a container ship owned by **Eagle Bulk Shipping** ([EGLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGLE)) was [hit by an antiship missile](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/shipping-stocks-rise-as-latest-houthi-attack-thrusts-dry-bulk-fleet-into-the-spotlight-89b57343?mod=home-page) fired from Houthi-controlled Yemen on Monday, the U.S. military's Central Command said.


IBD's ship transportation industry group climbed to No. 19 from 46 four weeks ago, although it's little changed in the past few weeks.


Among the most active shipping stocks Tuesday, **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) climbed 2.1%, and new issue **Okeanis Eco Tankers** ([ECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ECO)) rose 2.4%. Greece-based **Costamare** ([CMRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMRE)) rose 1.7 in Tuesday's stock market.

After taking a one-day break, the stock market resumed its October rally Monday, as good fortunes for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) carried over to multiple indexes.




The electric-vehicle maker raced nearly 13% to a new high, sending its market capitalization above $1 trillion. The move was a key factor in the Nasdaq composite's 0.9% gain and the S&P 500's 0.5% increase. Tesla is 3% of the Nasdaq index, and nearly 2% of the S&P 500. The stock accounted for nearly 13% of the S&P's total gain, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


It also was the main benefactor of the IBD 50, which added 2% Monday, and Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which rose 1%. The strong move also gave the consumer sector its best day since March.


Tesla rallied after [Hertz car rental said it is ordering 100,000 vehicles](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-soars-as-it-inks-deal-with-rental-car-giant-hertz/) by the end of 2022. Hertz is supporting its order with 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout its network in the U.S. and Europe.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102521-229x300.jpg)The automaker is only the sixth company to reach the $1 trillion milestone. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) have topped the $2 trillion mark. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are the other companies to have topped $1 trillion.


Tesla Dwarfs Other Automakers
-----------------------------


Tesla's valuation now exceeds the combined market cap of the next nine automakers. That includes **Toyota** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), **Volkswagen** ([VWAGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)), **BYD** ([BYDDF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYDDF)), **Daimler** ([DDAIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDAIF)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Small caps also led the stock market Monday, as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.9%. The S&P 500 made a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also made a new high, despite a small 0.2% gain.


Volume dipped on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by 12-7 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Stock Market Bounces From Dip
-----------------------------



Monday's gains proved to be a bullish response to Friday's losses, which marked [the first distribution day since the Oct. 14 market follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/techs-fall-but-these-stock-market-signals-offer-positive-tone/).


This supports IBD's recently revised stock market outlook of "confirmed uptrend." The Nasdaq is up 5.4% so far this month and the S&P 500 up 6%. Already, its the S&P 500's best month in almost a year. For the Nasdaq, it's the best month so far since June.


A pause from this strong advance would not be a surprise. Hefty gains in indexes or leading stocks can seduce investors into faulty trades. Remember to buy only when stocks make sound breakouts or [proper follow-on entries](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


It's uncomfortable when the stock market's gains are due to just a few gigantic stocks like Tesla, Apple or Alphabet. Yet, the stock market uptrend is broadening a bit.


MarketSmith's list of recent breakouts shows a good mix of financial, consumer, energy, health care, software, trucking and other industries.


The energy sector is up nearly 13% in October and added 1.5% Monday despite that oil price were weak.


Consumer Sector Leads Stock Market
----------------------------------


You would expect that higher fuel costs would hurt consumer spending. But the consumer discretionary sector also is rallying. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) surged 2.5% to a record high Monday, and is up more than 6% since it first made new highs on Oct. 14.



Tesla, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) are some of the main influences on the sector ETF's rally. By industry group, movies, leisure products, lodging and apparel are contributing to the sector.


By comparison, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) is trying to climb back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and is 3% from new highs.


Facebook [reported earnings after the close that beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-stock-in-focus-with-quarterly-earnings-report/). The stock rose in extended trading. Shares fell to the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) in regular trading, where they found support. The line represents a last line of defense for Facebook stock, which has had a rough six weeks.


This is the [biggest week of third-quarter earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/apple-earnings-other-major-techs-highlight-biggest-week-of-q3-earnings/), and the headliner today was Facebook. Microsoft — the [No. 1 company for environmental, social and governance principles](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/microsoft-stock-attracts-esg-investing-interest/) in IBD's special report — announces results Tuesday after the close.


Alphabet, the parent of Google and YouTube, also will announce after Tuesday's close. Apple and Amazon report Thursday after the close.

Bears clobbered the stock market Thursday for the fourth time in five sessions, slapping the bear market label onto the Nasdaq composite.




The Nasdaq dropped intraday to a 20.7% loss from its peak, below the traditional 20% yardstick for a bear market.


For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2%; the small-cap Russell 2000, 1.7%; the Nasdaq, 1.6%; and the S&P 500, 1.6%.


Volume was higher for both major exchanges vs. the previous session.

Utilities A Rare Gainer
-----------------------


Individual investors found few shelters Thursday outside of cash. The Dow Jones utility average, though, tacked on 0.4%.


Although the Nasdaq reached the bear market level, the Dow and the S&P 500 have yet to sink that far. The S&P 500's low represents a 17% decline. The Dow's low marked a 16% drop.


Should an investor take solace in the smaller drops of the Dow and the S&P 500? Not at all. This is no time for wishful thinking.


With the arrival of the bear market, disciplined IBD investors have probably been building cash for some time.


Cash might sound like a cold, unappealing place. But out in the cold is a good place to be when the house is burning down.


Three Stock Market Rules To Follow
----------------------------------


Disciplined investors have three rules to follow now in a bear market. No. 1, build a watch list. No. 2, watch for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) that would signal a new uptrend. No. 3, do nothing that isn't related to the first two rules.


What about individual investors who refused to sell and now are sitting on big losses?


The sad truth is there is no good answer for those folks. It's like choosing between the flu and food poisoning: Results are ugly in both cases.


For example, a stock such as **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) broke out in November and quickly rose 11% from the 290.40 buy point. Then it turned south.



IBD-style investors would've sold when the stock threatened to wipe out all of the gain. That isn't hindsight. It's an IBD rule. Pocketing a gain even as small as 1% or 2% made sense in Ulta's case.


Those who held onto the stock could be sitting on a 19% loss now.


The Search For Scapegoats
-------------------------


When bad things happen, it's human nature to search for scapegoats. There's plenty of that going around now. Investors can take their pick in the blame game:


—The stock market's dive is the fault of Fed chair Jerome Powell, who [refused to do what Wall Street wanted on rates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-hike-despite-dow-jones-jitters-trump-tweets/).


—President Donald Trump's tariffs are a tax, and they are hurting key U.S. industries, such as machinery, steel and farmers.


—Nothing is being done to avoid [a government shutdown](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dow-jones-falls-bear-market-trump-government-shutdown-fed-doubts/), so blame either the Democrats or Trump for not agreeing on how many bad checks to write.


Adult investors play the game differently. Blame no one, just face reality. Institutional investors are selling stocks. That's the reality. Don't fight the trend.


Statistics For Bulls
--------------------


New lows numbered almost 1,900 Thursday, while only a handful of stocks appeared on the new high ledger, according to preliminary data.


Bulls are at 39.3% in the most recent bears vs. bulls survey. According to Investors Intelligence, similar readings — in the past month or so — are the fewest since May 2016. The market had a decent rally beginning in late June 2016.


Going into Friday's session, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving average was at 12%.


These kinds of extreme readings sometimes coincide with a capitulation.


Individual investors, however, should avoid re-entering a bad market too soon. Wait for a follow-through day to signal a new uptrend is underway.

Major Stock Indexes Don't Do Much, But Facebook Gaps Up Aggressively
=====================================================================

Stocks pulled back for a second straight session Thursday as the indexes set up camp about 2% off all-time highs. The Nasdaq trimmed 0.3%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The IBD 50 gained 0.2%.

  

Volume declined on both major exchanges.

  

The falling volume and puny losses helped the indexes avoid a distribution day. There were no signs of widespread selling.

  

On the Nasdaq, losers led winners by a 7-to-6 ratio, while the edge that declining issues had on the NYSE was splinter-thin.

  

Banks, retail and apparel were among the top gainers among IBD's 197 industry groups. Gold-mining stocks took the hardest hit of the day. The iShares **Gold Trust** ([IAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IAU)) has fallen in eight of the past nine sessions, trimming 5%.

  

Conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December appears to be hurting gold. The conventional explanation is that because gold pays no dividend, it becomes less competitive in an atmosphere of rising rates.

  

Gold also can be regarded as a fear gauge, but it's hard to believe that a small hike in rates would put the permabears on the run.

  

Neither fear nor greed was widespread in Thursday's session.

  

Stocks making the biggest moves of the day came largely from the market laggards.

  

For example, apparel and fragrance maker **Ralph Lauren** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)) leapt 15%, but the stock remains 30% off its high. Online digital imagery marketer **Shutterstock** ([SSTK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSTK)) soared 19%, but it's still 60% off its high. **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) gapped up about 16% but is 40% off its high. Former market leader **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) rose almost 10%, but the drugmaker still has a load of overhead supply: It is 48% off its high.

  

The problem with most of these stocks is that none is top-rated.

  

One stock with better ratings is **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)). The stock jumped 8% in fast volume, clearing a 57.20 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern. Yet the base is late-stage.

  

A lack of quality breakouts on one day might not mean much. Stocks that broke out not too long ago are providing profits. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), for example, gapped up almost 5% Thursday. The stock was frustrating to hold earlier in the year. However, it is now 12% above a 96.59 buy point from a recent breakout.

  

On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release data for October. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to come in at 190,000. Estimates ranged from 150,000 to 240,000.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit new highs Thursday, as Wall Street had a delayed positive reaction to Wednesday's Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. And the Nasdaq composite closed at its highest level since July 16.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% to close above 42,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 gained 1.7%, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 2.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index climbed 2.1%.


Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with technology and consumer discretionary leading the way. Defensive sectors — consumer staples, real estate and utilities — fell as investors embraced risk.


Breadth was positive, as [advancers topped decliners](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us?mod=market-data-center) by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE and by nearly 3-to-1- on the Nasdaq.


Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq but was higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


The Nasdaq's Sept. 3 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) dropped off the overall count. When an index moves up 5% from the closing price of the distribution day, then it is considered no longer relevant to the current count.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MP091924--262x300.jpg)In the Dow Jones index, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) were among the biggest winners Thursday, with gains of 5.4% and 5.1%, respectively. They combined for more than 200 of the Dow's 522-point increase Thursday.


Meanwhile, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) contributed more than 215 points to the Dow Jones industrials' point gain, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


On the downside, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) were the biggest losers on the session, down 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. It was another sign that investors moved away from defensive assets.


[All of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended higher as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) jumped 3.7%. Notably, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rallied 4% to regain its 50-day moving average, while **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) raced above an early entry at 235, the high price on Sept. 5.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 2.1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) climbed 5% to break out past a 272.77 alternate entry.


What To Do Now
--------------


Thursday's rally was more evidence of stock market strength following Wednesday's hesitant action. That results in IBD's recommended market exposure level being lifted from 60%-80% to 80%-100%.


That means that investors can add more positions as market leaders break out past new entries. Those are good opportunities to put some capital to work.


Despite favorable action, the current environment still requires [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured another three stocks, building on a number of breakouts this week. That's another bullish layer for the stock market outlook.


Meanwhile, there are another 16 ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list, suggesting there are more buying opportunities ready to emerge.

Stocks danced to a slow beat Friday, rising in quiet post-holiday volume.


The Nasdaq ambled to a 0.7% gain, while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. The IBD 50 rose 0.6%.


Volume rose vs. Christmas Eve's half-session but ran lower on an hour-to-hour comparison. The market was closed on Christmas Day.


Around year-end, trade doesn't usually return to normal levels until early January.


Friday's nothing session, though, was good enough to erase a distribution day on the S&P 500. The Dec. 16 distribution day fell off the count because of price gains since that day of higher-volume losses.


With the market under pressure, stocks can still be bought, though the atmosphere isn't ideal. While the S&P 500 has made new intraday highs in each of the past three sessions, the Nasdaq didn't cross above its Nov. 28 high until Friday afternoon.


Both major indexes have scored their new highs in below-average volume. That isn't what bulls want to see, although volume tends to decline around the holidays.


The so-so action underlines the iffy nature of this market. A big gain in rising volume is needed to foster more confidence in the uptrend.


However, one bullish factor is the cushion that the indexes have built above their 50-day moving averages. Since retaking their 50-day line Dec. 17, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have risen 4% and 3% above their respective lines.


Another factor is the improvement in new highs vs. new lows. On Friday, combined NYSE and Nasdaq new highs hit 352 vs. 35 new lows â€” a bullish balance.


Yet breakouts among top-rated stocks continue to be scarce, as they have been so far this month.


Stocks that have shown promise after clearing buy points this month include **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)), **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) and **Virgin America** ([VA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VA)) .


Other breakouts, though, have run into trouble. **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) cleared a 197.74 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern Dec. 2 but triggered the 8% sell rule in mid-December. **Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) surged past a 40.35 buy point Dec. 11 and triggered the 8% sell rule in mid-December.


**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) pushed past a 238.87 buy point Dec. 19 and then sagged more than 3% below the entry. That isn't a sell signal, but it has to raise doubts.


The doubts probably pertain more to the market than to the particular stocks. An individual investor might want to keep these stocks on a watch list. The fact that they are even trying to break out in a pressured environment is a good sign.


If the market finds renewed strength and shakes the pressure, these stocks and their sectors might be places to look for good movers.


Until then, individual investors should remain careful about new buys.


For the week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.9%, while the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 1.4%. The small-cap S&P 600 gained 2.1%, and the IBD 50 fell 0.4% for the week.


The relative strength line for the IBD 50 hasn't shown any leadership in months. In strong uptrends, the IBD 50 will usually outperform the major indexes.


Humble pie was on the menu for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, too. One of the better weekly performers was the Dow Jones Utility Average, which gained 2.4%. If the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can't beat utility stocks, bulls are left wondering when credible leadership will emerge.

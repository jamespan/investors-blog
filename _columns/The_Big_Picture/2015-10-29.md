Stock indexes posted small losses in quiet volume Thursday, curbing any zeal that might have been blooming among the bulls. The Nasdaq stepped back 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shuffled down less than 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 dropped 1%.

  

The IBD 50 shed 0.4%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

After big gains in three of the previous five sessions, the stock market Thursday was ready for a reality check.

  

The negatives that lurk in this market include a struggling U.S. manufacturing segment; lackluster U.S. GDP numbers; a hesitant Federal Reserve; and in China, a growth pace that's slower though still enviable at 6.9%.

  

Then there are the unresolved issues in the background: Greek debt, a sick U.S. labor force participation rate and a zeitgeist that is hostile to capitalism.

  

Despite all this, the major indexes are cheerfully bouncing along, only 2% to 3% off their July highs.

  

If bull markets climb a wall of worry, then this wall has height and no shortage of bricks.

  

What should an individual investor do?

  

With the market in a confirmed uptrend, with breakouts emerging and with the new highs tally growing, this isn't time to head for the exits.

  

The only exception is if the stocks that you bought are acting funny or triggering a sell rule; or if the stocks are advancing to the 20%-25% profit-taking level, an area where most stocks will begin to consolidate.

  

In this market, it's more likely that recent buys haven't reached the 20% level. So sitting tight for a while makes sense.

  

On Thursday, the breakouts continued.

  

Health staffing provider **On Assignment** ([ASGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASGN)) jumped as much as 23% but then reversed to settle for a 7% gain. The stock cleared a 41.59 buy point. The company reported late Wednesday that revenue rose 29%, the best in eight quarters.

  

Mortgage software firm **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) also broke out, clearing a 75.29 entry in fast trade.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) reported after Thursday's close but failed to wow. Its earnings matched the Street's estimate, and revenue inched above views. Its outlook was soft. In after-hours trade, the stock fell as much as 4%.

  

In economic news, the first take on Q3 GDP was weaker than expected, jobless claims were fewer than feared, and pending home sales missed badly.

  

U.S.-based homebuilder stocks slid on the news.

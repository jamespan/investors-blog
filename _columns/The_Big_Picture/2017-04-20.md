Stocks Shift To Higher Gear; This Sector Leads The Way
=======================================================

U.S. stock indexes rumbled higher Thursday, as the Nasdaq scored its fourth best percentage gain of the year.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume rose.

Small caps led the way up, as the S&P 600 rolled 1.4% higher. Among the rising small caps, mattress store chain **Select Comfort** ([SCSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCSS)) gapped up 28% in torrid volume as it broke out of a base.


Blue chips too were mostly up. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) gapped up 5% to lead the components in the Dow Jones industrial average.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), another Dow component, popped 1.25% in average volume, as it continued its bounce off the 10-week line.


Despite the nice gains in the indexes, only a handful of top-rated stocks were rising in heavy volume.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) rose 1% in brisk volume, ending two days of sharp losses. Volume was 32% above average. China-based online marketplace **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) thrust 2% to a new 52-week high in heavy volume.


Chip equipment provider **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) followed up on Wednesday's 7% gain with a 2% gain Thursday. Both days were in heavy volume.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), though not currently a market leader, crossed above a 59.64 buy point in volume 36% faster than usual. The stock cleared a flat base within a larger consolidation. Starbucks had been stuck in a declining trough since October 2015.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's best gainers included steel producers, retailers and cement stocks. The worst performers included homebuilders, tobacco and utilities.


Economic Reports Mixed Thursday
-------------------------------


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were about 1% higher than expected, not enough of a miss to create concerns.


The Philadelphia Fed business gauge for April came in at 22 vs. the consensus view for 25.5. This too was not a great concern because the gauge has been coming off a 33-year high logged in February.


Leading indicators for March topped the Street's consensus view for a 0.2% gain. The figure registered 0.4% — above the entire range of estimates.


Data Set For Friday And Two Stocks To Watch
-------------------------------------------


On Friday, the PMI Composite Flash for April and existing-home sales for March will be released.


Meanwhile, the stock market will offer its first regular-session reaction to quarterly results that were released after Thursday's close.


**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) beat expectations after the close. Earnings rose 26% to 86 cents a share on a 24% revenue gain to $4.5 billion. The Street expected a 16% earnings gain to 79 cents a share. Revenue was pegged at $4.31 billion, up just under 19%. Visa rose almost 3% in after-hours trading.


Visa carries a Composite Rating of 93. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A reading of 93 puts the stock in the top seven percentile.


**E-Trade Financial** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)) reported that earnings increased 12% to 48 cents a share. Analysts estimated 39 cents a share, down 9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue was targeted for $532.54 million, up almost 13% but came in at $575 million or up 17%.


Technical Item And Reasons Behind the Gains
-------------------------------------------


Thursday was the 22nd session that IBD's market outlook has been "uptrend under pressure." The market has had trouble shaking off its sluggish action.


It's been an unusually long time to have the uptrend under pressure. Since the bull run began in March 2009, IBD has called the market under pressure at least 20 days six times, not including the current period. Four times, the next move was an uptrend that resumed, and twice the next move was into an outlook of correction.


Market watchers say that Thursday's gains were tied to several news elements. President Trump said he would review whether steel imports were hurting national security, comments that lifted steel stocks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was close to finishing a tax-cut package. Other reports said the Republicans were close to forging a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

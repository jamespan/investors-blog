Alphabet's Gaffe Sparks Stock Market Sell-Off; How To Handle This Hot AI Stock
===============================================================================

If traders were waiting for the stock market to cool off in a constructive fashion, for the most part they got that on Wednesday. But please take note: Volatility among individual stocks remains on the high side amid another [heavy week of quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/).




So, while 2023 is off to a terrific start for equities, it can still be immensely valuable among short-term investors to [take at least partial profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/). And the actions in the clothing apparel industry show why.


The buzziest headlines, meanwhile, appeared to center around companies that are chasing what could be the next holy grail in technology: [generative artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-news-artificial-intelligence-trends-and-leading-stocks/) (AI). Most early players in this field fell sharply, including a few of the [FAANG firms](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-meta-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/).


Stock Market Today: Internet Content Firms Slide
------------------------------------------------


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), which rocked the tech world when an ad of its new Bard AI technology reportedly [gave an incorrect answer](https://www.investors.com/news/google-stock-falls-after-googles-bard-ai-ad-shows-inaccurate-answer/) to a fairly basic astronomy question, slipped 7.7% in heavy turnover. That marked its biggest single-session percentage drop since Oct. 26.


The heavy selling pushed the Google search engine operator back below its still-falling [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). Shares, however, still hold a cushion above the now-rising [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


Megacap techs helped usher a 1.7% pullback in the Nasdaq composite.


Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 gave back 1.5% for its third decline in four sessions. Yet a daily chart on [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) shows the small-cap index still running nicely ahead of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The S&P 500 lost 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average surrendered just 0.6%.

Dow Jones: A Laggard So Far
---------------------------


While the Dow fell the least, it's also lagging other key indexes since Jan. 1. At 33,949, the blue chip index is up 2.4% year to date, a pale gain compared to a 13.8% jump by the Nasdaq and a 7.2% thrust higher by the S&P 500.


Volume, meanwhile, declined vs. the prior session on both exchanges, early data showed. This means institutional selling has so far not gotten to a level where it could tip the current bullish balance between supply and demand.


A handful of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 1% or more, bucking the stock market decline. They included drugstores, cable telecom and satellite equipment makers, oil and gas drilling, computer hardware and peripherals, managed care and automakers. (See the full performance of all 197 groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


On the downside, clothing makers, homebuilders, internet content firms, water utilities, restaurants and department store chains led the way down.


Standing out among these industries: **Capri** ([CPRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRI)), whose stock plunged almost 24% in massive volume and gave back three months' worth of gains. The stock, formerly known as Michael Kors, found support at its 200-day line, but that probably offered cold comfort to recent buyers.


The owner of iconic fashion brands including Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace posted a 17% dip in December-quarter earnings due to a 6% fall in sales to $1.51 billion. That broke a seven-quarter streak of year-over-year gains in the top line. Capri CEO John Idol noted in a news release that the company was "disappointed with the performance of our global wholesale business in the quarter, which resulted in expense deleverage and a lower operating margin."



Fundamentals Still Lead Technicals
----------------------------------


Of course, it's absolutely difficult, if not impossible, to predict what part of a multinational enterprise may miss Wall Street's forecasts. Yet the concept of [taking profits at 20%-25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) could have helped Capri investors sidestep this horrible reaction.


For instance, a [trendline drawn from the left-side peak of the yearlong cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) generated an aggressive entry near 49. In the week ended Nov. 11, Capri coasted past this price and raced back above its 200-day moving average. Gains reached 20% by the time the stock built a handle on its large base in mid-December. This action set up a standard buy point at 60.71.

Another [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) point on Capri: Its earnings and sales had shown slowing increases in the two prior quarters. So, the stock, with a 48 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) and a B for its Sales + Margins + Return on Equity grade, did not exactly carry the strongest fundamentals within the apparel manufacturing group. Meanwhile, the group itself fell 4.2% on a price-weighted basis for its fifth straight decline.


C3.ai Stock Leads Today
-----------------------



Meanwhile, **C3.ai** ([AI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AI)) has dazzled in the stock market so far this year. Shares of the developer of AI applications for intensive data processing jumped above the 200-day moving average at 15.78 on Jan. 27, then went skyward. Over the next six sessions, shares soared as much as 74%.


That's not even the kind of gain you'd expect when a true market leader, after rising methodically for months, suddenly goes into a [climax run](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-climax-run-is-top-gun-of-a-sell-signal-taser-made-one-in-2004/). So, would it make sense to take at least partial profits? Yes. You would not want to see all of the gains vanish. Now is not the time to throw caution to the wind and simply chase the stock. If the stock market wants to rally more this year, C3.ai and others will have plenty of time to form [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and present clear buy points.


The company is slated to report fiscal third-quarter results on March 2. C3.ai, based in Redwood City, Calif. and led by the legendary Siebel Systems founder Tom Siebel, has yet to log a quarterly profit. Sales growth has decelerated in recent quarters, from a 42% rise in the quarter ended in January 2022 to 38%, 25% and 7%. C3.ai's trailing 12-month sales totaled $270 million.

Beyond Stock Market Today: Treasuries Rise
------------------------------------------


While the stock market took a breather, long-dated U.S. government bonds rose for the first time in four sessions. The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note edged 2 basis points lower to 3.65%.


One of the key risks to the current stock market uptrend still lies in the question: Will inflation keep coming down to a level that makes the Federal Reserve comfortable?


The strong [January U.S. jobs report last week](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-surges-as-jobless-rate-falls-sp-500-futures-lower/), combined with recent remarks by Fed chief Jerome Powell, seems to have convinced Wall Street that the terminal interest rate on the short end of the yield curve is in fact going beyond 5%.


CME's Fed Watch calculator currently shows a 65% probability that the U.S. central bank will raise the fed funds rate to at least a target range of 5%-5.25% by May. The current level: 4.5%-4.75%. This means the Fed would ratchet rates up a quarter point both at its March 22 meeting and the next one on May 3. Meanwhile, a minority of traders also think another quarter-point hike could take place at the June 14 meeting.


Rick Pitcairn, chief global strategist at the $7 billion family office and investment firm Pitcairn, notes the Fed is giving clues that it does not want to make the same mistake it made during the 1970s. That is, when the rate of inflation made an initial drop, central bankers decided it was OK to stop tightening the money supply. Yet prices raged again. Ultimately, the Fed had to wage three additional campaigns in raising rates to finally slay the inflation dragon.

Remember Chairman Volcker
-------------------------


Pitcairn noted that during that inflation fight, it culminated with former Fed Chair Paul Volcker sending long-term rates above 20% in the early 1980s. "They had to fight inflation at higher rates," Pitcairn told IBD.


According to a recent piece by bond market observer James Grant, Volcker had ironically said on Jan. 11, 1971, while serving as undersecretary of the Treasury Department for monetary affairs, that the "momentum of inflation has been clearly checked."


"So I caution investors to remember this: The CPI can fall, but the Fed might not cut rates. We could stay higher for longer," Pitcairn added, referring to the consumer price index. Also, "the Fed sees employment-related inflation as more endemic."

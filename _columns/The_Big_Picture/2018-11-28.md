Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave the stock market an early Christmas present Wednesday with dovish remarks on interest rates, sparking emphatic gains in the stock market.




The head of the Federal Reserve suggested that interest rates may not need to increase much more. In a speech, Powell said [interest rates are "just below" levels considered neutral.](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chairman-jerome-powell-fed-rates-neutral-dow-jones/)


"Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy — that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth," Powell told the Economic Club of New York.


As soon as Powell's comments made the news wires, indexes extended gains sharply. The Nasdaq composite soared 2.9%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average 2.5%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which resulted in a [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) for the market. It changes IBD's market outlook from a correction to a confirmed uptrend.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MP112818-225x300.jpg)The follow-through came on the fifth day of a rally attempt that began after the Nasdaq's Nov. 20 low. Investors can now start increasing exposure to stocks, but cautiously.


Already one follow-through (on Nov. 7) did not work. While every market bottom has a follow-through, not all follow-throughs result in lasting advances. Also, whenever the market starts a correction with a violent decline like it did in October, the first couple of follow-throughs often fail.


Advancing stocks led decliners by a 4-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 7-to-2 on the Nasdaq.


Curiously, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased only 1 basis point to 3.04%. The bond market didn't share the same expectations about interest rates as stock investors.


The stock market still has some questions to answer. Are there enough quality stocks breaking out? On Wednesday, there were few, despite the big index gains.


**Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) leapt past the 127.48 buy point of a cup-without-handle base in volume about 30% higher than normal.


**Allegion** ([ALLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLE)), a maker of security products for homes and businesses, jumped past the 90.79 buy point of a cup with handle. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) broke out of a cup with handle with a 110.48 buy point. Both saw pale volume.


Next Stock Market Leaders?
--------------------------


Another question is, where will the new market leadership rest? If the market is indeed in a new uptrend, it can't count on the FAANG stocks. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) are trashed.


Surely, they remain critical companies that will help determine the market's direction. Amazon.com alone accounts for more than half of the expected earnings growth for all S&P 500 retailers in Q4, according to FactSet.


Health care and consumer stocks are two areas to watch. **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) [rose after hours](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/veeva-earnings-veeva-stock-q3/) on its earnings report. **PRA Health Sciences** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) is [near new highs](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ibd-stock-of-the-day-pra-health-stock/). **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) hit a new high. **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) is near highs also.


There are some opportunities in finance, where **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) cleared a trend line. The stock was added to IBD Leaderboard and Swing Trader.


While the market could breathe easier about interest rates, the trade war with China is heating up. President Trump has heightened threats of more tariffs, and he is due to meet this weekend with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Foreign trade policy is a festering wound for Wall Street.


The Dow got a big boost from **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which rose nearly 5% in ample volume. Indonesian investigators said that a [Lion Air Boeing 737 jet that crashed into the sea was not airworthy](https://www.investors.com/news/lion-air-crash-boeing-737-max-safe-boeing-stock/) before its fatal flight. Boeing said the Boeing 737 Max is "as safe as any airplane" ever flown.

Stocks Nap, But Is Positive News Hinting At Upside Surprise?
=============================================================

Stock indexes ended a slow week on weak price moves, though volume faded.


The Nasdaq fell 0.4% Friday, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.8%. The IBD 50 shed 0.5%. Volume fell across the board.


A trifecta of positive news Friday failed to put the market in a generous mood. The three items:


* Retail sales in April grew 1.3% vs. March, the best pop in more than a year and above the highest estimate in the range. On a year-ago basis, the gain was 3%. And Internet retail sales jumped 10% vs. the year-ago period.
* Business inventories chimed in with a 0.4% gain in March, also above the entire range of estimates. Sales rose, putting a bullish spin on the inventory buildup. Inventories rising when sales are flagging is bearish. But inventories rising as sales grow can indicate optimistic restocking.
* The University of Michigan's consumer gauge came in at 95.8, the highest level in almost a year.


![MP_051316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP_051316-218x300.jpg)The three surprises could be pointing to a stronger GDP number than the 0.5% growth reported in April. If so, the Street will soon know. The second reading on GDP will be released before the market's open on May 27.


The best gauge for the stock market, however, is the stock market itself, and upbeat talk isn’t too convincing there.


On Friday, the S&P 500 closed under its 50-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq also is under its 50-day line.


The major indexes haven't had a week without at least one day of distribution since mid-February.


The catch? Bulls can argue that despite the distribution, the market has risen steadily.


Too much focus on the word “pressure” -- in an uptrend under pressure -- can lead investors to overlook the word “uptrend.”


Still, individual investors can be forgiven for wondering where this market is going.


Cushions after breakouts have been slow to develop, but breakouts generally aren’t failing.


Paris-based **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) broke out Friday, clearing a 43.44 buy point in strong volume. The ad-tech firm's last profitable breakout was a year ago when it posted a 23% gain in two months.


For the week, the Nasdaq lost 0.4% while the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 gave back 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively.


**The coming week**: Data on the housing sector will roll in with Monday’s Housing Market Index, Tuesday’s housing starts and Friday’s existing-home sales.


What would it take to fire up homebuilder stocks? Don’t look for help on the earnings front. Most homebuilders already have reported Q1 results. In most cases, homebuilders topped estimates but fell anyway.

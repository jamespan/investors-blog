The major indexes reversed lower for a second straight session Wednesday. And this time, neither the oil patch nor the commodities sector was to blame.

  

The Nasdaq composite wasted a modest early gain and ended off 0.3%, adding to Tuesday's 0.9% decline. Big gains by biotechs and chip firms stunted the slide. The Philly SOX soared 3.8%.

  

The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.5%. As seen on Page B2, the past two days of declines make a minor portion of the 7.1% rebound achieved by the large-cap benchmark from the close on Sept. 29 to the close on Oct. 12.

  

Even though the overall declines were light, the accelerating volume on both exchanges made it the second day in a row of heavy institutional selling. IBD calls significant declines in higher turnover "distribution." Large investors are distributing shares to the public and raising cash.

  

At three distribution days for the Nasdaq in recent weeks, the market can still keep rising and give investors a crack at new breakouts that may emerge. On the S&P 500, the distribution count is still low at two. But further declines in higher volume could mean that the fledgling October rally lacks true legs.

  

Retail and consumer stocks led Wednesday's decline, a surprise twist in the market's narrative of choppy action over the past year. Look at the 10 worst industry groups on Wednesday, and most came from the retail and building sectors.

  

Indeed, if the old lady who became famous for the 1980s "Where's the beef?" TV commercials for **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)) were a regular market observer today, she would likely cry: "Where's the revenue?"

  

U.S. retail sales ex autos fell 0.3% in September, missing views for a 0.1% dip. The scarcity of sales growth is stunning in an era of ultra-low interest rates. **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), the Dow 30 component, was slammed 10% lower on Wednesday in monster trade after issuing a poor full-year [top-line outlook](http://news.investors.com/business/101415-775583-walmart-cuts-sales-earnings-guidance-stock-dives.htm). Earlier, Thomson Reuters estimated fiscal Q3 sales falling 0.8% to $118.1 billion.

  

Wal-Mart, which competes in virtually every region in the world, suffers from the law of large numbers. No one could reasonably expect the retailer to increase sales 25%, 50% or more when the base is north of $100 billion each quarter.

  

The IBD 50 tends to feature smaller companies with much more robust growth rates. In Wednesday's list, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) show five-year annual sales growth rates of 12% to 22%.

Tech stocks rebounded Thursday, fueled by upbeat results from **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and bullish comments from the electric car maker's chief executive, Elon Musk. Tesla stock surged nearly 22%, its largest percent increase since May 9, 2013, according to Dow Jones market data.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite ended the day up 0.8%, near session highs. And the small-cap Russell 2000 index inched higher.




Volume fell on the Nasdaq, but inched higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with materials and industrials leading the downside. The consumer discretionary sector was the clear leader Thursday.


On the economic front, the Labor Department's first-time jobless claims unexpectedly fell to 227,000 vs. 241,000 in the previous week. They were anticipated to rise to 247,000, per Econoday estimates, due to an expected rise in filings following the recent hurricanes.

Tesla Stock Surges
------------------


Late Wednesday, Tesla announced a surprise gain in third-quarter earnings, with quarterly profit growing 9%, capping off a big month of announcements for the EV giant. Revenue came in light. Still, Tesla stock bullishly regained its 50-day line Thursday, approaching a 264.86 buy point in a cup with handle.


On the [Tesla earnings call](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-earnings-q3-elon-musk/), CEO Musk was calmly bullish throughout, upbeat on full self-driving, vehicle deliveries, storage and more.


Meanwhile, a number of analyst firms — including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — [increased Tesla stock price targets](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-early-christmas-present-earnings-brings-out-bulls/) following the company's third-quarter earnings Wednesday, which contained profit and margins surprises.


Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, wrote that the company "delivered an early Christmas present for investors as the bulls got a monster margin rebound and a surprisingly strong delivery outlook for 2025."


Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MP102424.jpg)In the Dow Jones index, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) were the biggest gainers Thursday with gains of 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively, on the stock market today.


On the downside, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)), both of which reported earnings, were the Dow losers during the session, down 6.2% and 5.1%, respectively.


Aided by Tesla, [the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended sharply higher as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) rallied 3.1%. And the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund gained 0.8% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list, **Celestica** ([CLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLS)) leapt back above a 63.49 buy point.


What To Do Now
--------------


Despite the recent losses, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue to perform mostly well, and the Nasdaq's power trend is still intact as the index holds just above its 21-day line. Thus, IBD continues with an 80%-100% recommended exposure.


The current stock market environment still requires [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market. Watch for sell signals and other abrupt character changes in your holdings.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured two stocks. **CBOE Global Markets** ([CBOE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBOE)) crossed above a 216.14 flat-base entry. Meanwhile, there are six ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list. That suggests that there are a few buying opportunities ready to emerge.

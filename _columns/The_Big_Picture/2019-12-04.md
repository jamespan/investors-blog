Stock Market Bounces Back, Ends 3-Session Slide; Shopify Jumps On Bullish Sales Data
=====================================================================================

Major stock indexes snapped three-session slides Wednesday, helped by a Bloomberg report that the U.S. and China are nearing an agreement on how much to roll back tariffs as part of a preliminary trade deal. Semiconductor stocks bounced back after some selling in the stock market Tuesday.




The Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite gapped up at the open and traded in a tight range all day. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq added 0.5% each, and the S&P 500 picked up 0.6%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday.


The stock market shrugged off news that private payrolls rose a scant 67,000 in November, well below the consensus estimate of 156,000. The data comes ahead of Friday's official jobs report. The only economic data that's been a sore spot for the stock market in recent months is manufacturing. Earlier this week, the ISM manufacturing index contracted for the fourth straight month as slowing global growth hurts demand for manufactured goods. That said, concerns about a recession for the U.S. economy have subsided greatly.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP120419-253x300.jpg)Money flowed out of bonds, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield by 6 basis points to 1.77%. That fueled strong showings for **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) in the [Dow Jones today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/dow-jones-today-dow-stocks-stock-market-news/). JPMorgan continues to hold near highs after a breakout in September. Goldman, meanwhile, bounced off its 50-day moving average Wednesday. It's still trying to break free from a consolidation that started in late July.


Oil Jumps Ahead Of OPEC Meeting
-------------------------------


Oil and gas related industry groups outperformed as oil prices rose, but very few stocks in the sector are actionable. The U.S. exploration and production group surged nearly 4%. But headed into Wednesday, the group ranked 189th out of [197 groups ranked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-03-2019/) based on six-month price performance.


At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $58.43 a barrel, up 4.2%, helped by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories. There's also hope of [deeper production cuts from OPEC](https://www.investors.com/news/opec-meeting-saudi-arabia-iraq-russia-oil-production-quotas-2020/) when it convenes Thursday in Vienna.


Stock Market Sentiment
----------------------


Meanwhile, Investors Intelligence released its latest reading on newsletter writer sentiment. The bulls dropped to 54.8% from a lofty reading of 58.1% last week. Bullish sentiment hit 58% in mid-July just ahead of a 6.8% decline for the S&P 500. Excessive bullishness has been seen near several market tops in the past, including the tech bubble's burst in 2000. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong when it comes to timing the market.


But the market's message is clear for now: The [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) is still intact despite two straight distribution days Monday and Tuesday for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Even better, the vast majority of market-leading growth stocks continue to act well.

Many continue to trade tightly near highs after breakouts. Others are forming nice bases, including [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) names like **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)). **Jabil** ([JBL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBL)) is getting support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after a powerful breakout in late September.



**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) rose sharply for a second straight session after the company released [bullish holiday e-commerce sales data](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-pops-company-reports-holiday-ecommerce-jump/).


Chip Stocks Bounce Back
-----------------------


After falling 1.4% Tuesday, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) snapped back 1.45%. Despite selling in the sector Tuesday, [several leading chip stocks](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/top-stocks-chip-groups-rally-on-china-trade-deal-hopes/) held up just fine. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) nearly touched its 50-day moving average and quickly found buying support. It's one of several chip-equipment stocks showing strength, along with **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)).

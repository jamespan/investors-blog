U.S. stock indexes leaned the Nasdaq's way Thursday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed in the red.




The Nasdaq added 0.2% after being up 0.6% early. [Blue chips](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) in the Dow fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 ended just under the break-even line. The small-cap Russell 2000 sagged 0.8%.


Volume rose modestly on the Nasdaq and fell slightly on the NYSE.

For example, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) [clobbered the consensus estimate on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-earnings-amazon-stock-q1-2019/) but only slightly topped views on revenue. The stock edged higher in after-hours trade. Quarterly earnings were 50% higher than expected.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) reported earnings that were moderately higher than expected and revenue slightly above expectations. The chip stock skidded 7% on [a disappointing outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-earnings-q1-2019-intel-stock/).


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) fell modestly after hours. The company topped the Street's view on earnings and essentially matched views on revenue.


In the meantime, bears found a few stocks to rip apart Thursday, but the list of victims was short.


Two Bear Targets
----------------


Semiconductor designer **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) plunged 17% in heavy volume. That brought the stock back to 18% above the 98.10 entry in January. (Note: The ideal buy point of 95.28 was not actionable because of a gap-up. The opening price of 98.10 became the realistic entry.)


Xilinx's advance intraday Wednesday reached as much as 44% from the 98.10 entry.


The stock knifed under its 50-day line in strong volume Thursday — an unmistakable sell signal.


Xilinx's revenue topped expectations, but [earnings were below estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-stock-falls-q4-2019-earnings/).


Meanwhile, sellers swatted **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) shares 13% lower after the blue chip missed on earnings and revenue. The diversified industrial company lost its 50-day and 200-day lines.


Bullish Action
--------------


Some stocks turned an initially ugly move into an encouraging rebound. For instance, aerospace play **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)) slouched 5% in the first hour of trade but then cut the loss to 0.8%.


China-based **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) dropped 9% in the first 15 minutes of trade and then rebounded to close with a 2% loss.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) dived as much as 7%, which took the stock to its 50-day moving average. Then the stock bounced, cutting the loss to 4.5%. The support at the 50-day line was a favorable sign.


Technicals And Chart Work
-------------------------


The March 20 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 expired because of time. After 25 sessions, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.


The Nasdaq marked a new all-time high at 8151.84.


Economic Data
-------------


Durable goods orders in March rose 2.7% vs. the consensus estimate of 0.7%. Core capital goods, a proxy for business spending, rolled 1.3% higher vs. estimates for 0.1%.


First-time jobless claims registered 230,000, above expectations for 209,000.


On Friday before the open, the first reading on first-quarter real GDP will be released. The Street's consensus estimate is 2.3%. Estimates range from 1.4% to 2.8%.

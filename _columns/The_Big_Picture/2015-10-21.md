Indexes Fall Again As Earnings Results Boost Stock Volatility
==============================================================

Stocks retreated for a second straight session Wednesday as the quarterly earnings rodeo remained in full swing. Meanwhile, a 19% collapse by former market leader **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) (it was down as much as 39.7% intraday) reaffirmed the violent sector rotation hitting the market. Valeant triggered a sell signal when it undercut its 50-day line in big volume on Aug. 20.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.8%, and the S&P 500 dropped 0.6%. Since volume rose on both exchanges, both key indexes logged another distribution day, or what IBD calls a session of intense professional selling.

  

As the Market Pulse table shows, the distribution count has ticked up to five on the Nasdaq, normally a level at which investors should be on high alert.

  

Market history has shown it can take just four or five such declines to demolish a market uptrend. The S&P 500's August-September 2000 top is one of the best examples in recent history.

  

Yet it's hard to say a market top is happening for sure today.

  

The Nasdaq has given up only a fraction of its gains since a powerful rebound started on Sept. 30.

  

The S&P 500 has a nice air cushion above its still-falling 50-day moving average. The large-cap benchmark decisively crossed back above the support line four days after a powerful follow-through took place on Oct. 2.

  

Through Wednesday's close at nearly 2019, the S&P 500 is still up 3.5% above the Oct. 2 finish.

  

Going back to the Nasdaq, the prior four distribution days in recent weeks showed declines of 0.7%, 0.9%, 0.3% and 0.5%.

  

None of those sell-offs was of the supremely harsh category.

  

Still, an investor must be extra picky about what stocks to buy. Purchasing a stock before earnings results can be treacherous. So too is grabbing shares in a stock that has already built a bunch of bases.

  

Continue to read the Industry Themes, Sector Leaders, IPO Analysis and Stock Spotlight columns to get a strong sense of new sectors and industries into which the big money is flowing.

  

A wall of worry continues to exist in terms of investor psychology. Bearishness is heavy across the board. The put-call volume ratio continues to hold near the 1.0 level. (See the graph below the Nasdaq chart on Page B2.)

  

Worry is good for the market. When investors worry, they usually wait on the sidelines. This means that fresh capital could potentially move back into stocks.

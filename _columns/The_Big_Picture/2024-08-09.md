  Stock Market Ends Roller-Coaster Week Well Off Lows; Inflation Data, Retail Sales Loom

The stock market ended a wild week well off lows, with the S&P 500 erasing nearly all of its losses. Now, fresh inflation data and a new retail sales reading loom in the coming week.




The past week was certainly not one for the faint of heart on the Nasdaq. It rose 0.5% Friday, but closed the week down just 0.2%. It managed to erase most of Monday's 3.4% plunge after getting support at the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). The tech-heavy index now holds a gain of 11.6% for the year so far.


The S&P 500 notched a daily gain of 0.5% and ended the week virtually flat, though nominally lower. The index has yet to test the 200-day line but remains about 2% below the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). It holds a gain of 12% for 2024.


Advancers held the edge on decliners on the New York Stock Exchange while the opposite was the case on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower for each on Friday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes on the stock market, rising 0.1% while it suffered a weekly decline of 0.6%. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fared best while **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) once again lagged.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP080924.jpg)Small caps also failed to keep in stride, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.2%. Growth stocks were stronger, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund rising 0.4%.


Recent negative action and ongoing uncertainty mean Investor's Business Daily is holding its recommended exposure level in the 0% to 20% range. But stocks have rallied well from lows, and volatility has eased.


The currently rally attempt is still in play and has cleared its fourth day. A follow-through day could signal the start of a new stock market uptrend and an appropriate increase of exposure from the current levels. If the market undercuts Monday's low, however, the rally attempt would be null and investors would need to wait for a new attempt to transpire.


Inflation Data, Walmart Earnings Loom
-------------------------------------


Stocks were hammered earlier this week due to ongoing fallout from a weak jobs report and the unraveling of the Japanese yen carry trade. A benevolent jobless claims reading Thursday helped stocks fight back with fury.


There is more economic data due in the coming week that could move the markets. The Producer Price Index comes Tuesday, with headline PPI seen rising 2.6% year over year. Consumer Price Index data drops Wednesday. Headline CPI is seen holding steady at a 3% lift on an annualized basis, while it is expected to ease slightly to a 3.2% year-over-year rise when food and energy costs are excluded.


Additionally, U.S. retail sales data for July will be announced Thursday. There have been signs that the consumer is weakening, so this could provide further insight. Jobless claims data comes the same day and another strong reading could further soothe investor fears about the economy. Finally, the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys are also due Thursday.


Meanwhile, there are some [noteworthy earnings reports due in the week ahead](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-spotlight-retail-leader-walmart-on-holding/). Retail behemoth **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), farming equipment giant **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), Warren Buffett stock **Nu** ([NU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NU)) and **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)) are among companies posting results.


ELF Falls From Shelf, Hurting This Stock Market Group
-----------------------------------------------------


Nearly all of the [S&P 500 sectors closed Friday higher](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Communication services and technology made the strongest gains. Only materials ended the day lower, but the loss was slight.



As ever, the relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups gave a deeper insight into what happened on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Medical software firms, diversified medical plays such as [new Leaderboard stock](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/) **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), data storage stocks and mail order retailers were among the best performers. The educational software group also outperformed.


In contrast, cable stocks, radio and TV companies, office supply retailers, and distributors of metal products lagged. Cosmetics stocks struggled after **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) plunged following its quarterly report, undercutting the 200-day line in the process. The firm beat on earnings, but investors balked at signs of slowing growth.

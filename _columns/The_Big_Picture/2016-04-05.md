Stocks woke up on the wrong side of the bed Tuesday and stayed grumpy all day, content to follow the lead of most overseas equities markets, which were also in a foul mood.


For the Nasdaq, it was a short stay above its 200-day moving average. It gapped down and lost 1%. The S&P 500 also fell 1%, while the Dow gave up nearly 0.8%. Volume on both exchanges rose from Monday’s levels, resulting in another distribution day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1 on both exchanges. The IBD 50 held up better than the broad market, falling just 0.6%.


The Nasdaq’s distribution is starting to get elevated, but it’s not a market under heavy distribution.


![MP040516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MP040516-604x1024.jpg)NYSE volume was skewed a bit by **Allergan**’s ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) heavy-volume slide. Shares crumbled 15% as Wall Street turned doubtful about its merger with **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)). Late Monday, the U.S. government proposed regulations that could remove the tax advantages of the deal. More than 36 million Allergan shares traded hands Tuesday. As of Monday’s close, Allergan’s 50-day average daily volume was 3 million.


Gold emerged as a safe haven trade again. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), which mirrors the price of gold, added 1.3%. A breakout over a 120.94 buy point didn’t last very long, but after a paying a visit to its 50-day line, the ETF could be setting up for another breakout try.


Biotechs outperformed. Inside the biotech group, small-cap **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)) is acting well as it works on the right side of a 14-week consolidation. While many biotechs are still far off 52-week highs, Emergent is only 7% off its high.


In economic news, ISM’s nonmanufacturing index showed faster growth in March after hitting a two-year low in February. The export orders gauge rose to 58.5, a one-year high. Last week, the ISM manufacturing index rose to 51.8, above the neutral 50 level for the first time in seven months.


The minutes from the March 16 Federal Reserve meeting will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern time. It’s hard to envision any surprises in the statement, as the Fed continues to be quite transparent about where they’re at with rate hikes. According to CME Group FedWatch, the odds of rate hike at the April 27 meeting are 3%.


When it comes to the action in growth stocks, clearly they’re faring better, but low volume has generally accompanied many of the gains. Meanwhile, IBD’s sector rankings still reveal a defensive posture. Headed into Tuesday, the mining, utility and food/beverage were the top-ranked sectors in the market.


**Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) had a good day, rising 2% in heavy volume. But part of Tuesday’s strength might have been short covering ahead of Acuity's earnings report, due Wednesday before the open. As of mid-March, short interest stood at 3.2 million shares, up from 2.4 million shares in mid-February.


The LED lighting firm has a consistent track record of earnings and sales growth. Quarterly profit is seen rising 40% to $1.51 a share, with sales up 22% to $752.3 million.

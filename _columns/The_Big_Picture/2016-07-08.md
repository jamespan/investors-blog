Stock indexes crackled higher Friday, as the market lit up on bullish jobs data.


The Nasdaq gapped up 1.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average popped 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively. The S&P 500 came close to a record closing high. The small-cap S&P 600 led with a 2.4% blast. The IBD 50 leapt 1.8%.


![MP070816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP070816-168x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was practically flat on the NYSE.


The catalyst for the strong open, and the increased momentum for the rest of the day, was the nonfarm payroll report for June.


Payrolls surged to 287,000 -- above the consensus view for 180,000 and 22% above the highest estimate in the range, according to Econoday. This followed May's pathetic jobs increase, which was revised downward from 38,000 to an even more puny 11,000.


The market didn't seem to notice the May revision but instead celebrated the June surprise.


The 287,000 level was the highest since December's 292,000 but that number was eventually revised downward to 262,000.


Friday's burst of optimism appeared to rule out a recession this year, a possibility that the Brexit vote had revived.


In keeping with the bullish view, Divisia M4 including Treasuries has jumped 4% to 5.2% in each of the past five months. Divisia is the broadest gauge of the money supply. This bodes well for the U.S. economy.


Chart challenges also linger. The S&P 500 needs to prove it can hold above 2100 and the Nasdaq still faces old resistance at 5,000. After more than a week of sharp gains (all post-Brexit losses have now been recouped), a moderation in the market's advance should be expected.


On Friday, the stock market had no time for pessimism. Even the middle-of-the-pack homebuilders showed some life.


**D.H. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) hit new highs in brisk volume and have topped buy points. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) cleared an aggressive entry Friday in fast trade, while **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) added to Thursday's low-volume breakout with a follow-up gain in heavy volume.


Homebuilders, though, have provided head fakes before -- breaking out only to chop around and stall out.


On Friday, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com, in an article for CNBC, argued that the housing market should grow through the summer. He added that, through May, combined sales of existing and new homes rose 6% vs. the year-ago period. That's the best growth since 2007.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 3.1%; the Nasdaq, 1.9%; and the S&P 500, 1.3%.

The Nasdaq composite gapped down at the open and didn't recover much in the stock market Tuesday as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway.


The tech-heavy index slumped 1.7% in higher volume on the fifth day of its rally attempt. The rally that started on March 12 is still intact because the Nasdaq never violated its March 11 low. Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by nearly 2-to-1, but breadth improved a bit as the session wore on.




Large-cap technology stocks in the Magnificent Seven lagged for the second straight session. After declining 1% Monday, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund fell another 2.6%.


Inside that ETF, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) led the downside with losses of 3.7% and 5.3%, respectively. It's unlikely that the Magnificent Seven stocks will resume their leadership anytime soon. The only stock above its 200-day moving average at this point is Meta.


Nvidia Lags On Stock Market
---------------------------


Artificial intelligence leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell 3.4% in higher volume on the first day of the company's GTC AI Conference. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said that AI is going through an inflection point and that data center spending will reach $1 trillion by 2028.


The statement comes amid some harsh selling in AI-related stocks lately. Besides Nvidia, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is more than 20% off its recent high. The only difference is that Broadcom, unlike Nvidia, is still holding above its 200-day line.

While it's human nature to try to catch a former leader like Nvidia on sale after a sell-off, it's also important to realize that some former leaders, especially those hit hard by institutional selling in recent weeks, will not go on to lead the next stock market uptrend. When new money starts to come in from the sidelines and the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 confirm new uptrends with follow-through days, it's very likely there could be a new crop of leaders.


The S&P 500 fell 1.1% in lower volume on the third day of its rally attempt. Similar to the Nasdaq exchange, decliners beat winners on the NYSE by nearly 2-to-1.

Oil-and-gas producer **Coterra Energy** ([CTRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRA)) outperformed on the S&P 500 as money continued to flow into the sector. Coterra barely topped a 29.06 buy point early in the session but backed off highs by the close. Group peer **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) is also showing relative strength as it sits just below a 76.22 buy point. Investor's Business Daily's exploration and production group was one of the day's top performers, rising 0.5%.


Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively.


Gold Stocks Help Buoy This ETF
------------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) held up relatively well with a decline of just 0.6%, buoyed by strength in **Alignment Healthcare** ([ALHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALHC)) and **Aris Water Solutions** ([ARIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARIS)), along with gold stocks like [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)).


IBD's gold mining group was one of the day's top performers, up around 0.7%.


The 10-year Treasury yield has been holding gains after rallying sharply off its early-March low of nearly 4.11%. Just after the stock market close, the yield was trading around 4.28%, down two basis points.


The Fed is widely expected to keep the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.50% when the [policy statement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-march-preview-jerome-powell-sp-500-trump-tariffs-inflation-tax-cuts/) is released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. Rate-cut expectations have been dialed way back as the Fed deals with waning consumer confidence and the prospects of a tariff-induced slowdown for the U.S. economy.


At one point Tuesday, traders gave a 66% chance that the next Fed rate cut would come at the June meeting with only one more rate cut expected after that before the end of the year.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


Small cap **EverQuote** ([EVER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVER)) reminded investors that it remains a treacherous environment for breakouts. After soaring past a 26.99 entry Monday in strong volume, EverQuote slumped nearly 6% Tuesday â€” also in heavy volume.

**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), which had rallied nicely off its 50-day moving average in recent days, gave back nearly 5%.


Investors who are lightly invested with some exposure to gold and insurance stocks are sitting pretty at the moment. For those watching from the sidelines, sitting mostly in cash, that's also a good position. But it's still important to stay abreast of which stocks are working and which ones aren't.


Thinly traded insurer **Bowhead Specialty** ([BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)), with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, marked its third straight heavy-volume gain. It's near the top of a cup base with a conventional entry of 37.81. But after a strong bounce off its 50-day line last week, Bowhead already looks extended and could be ready to add a handle to its current pattern. Watch for an orderly, low-volume decline from here.


Biotechs See Money Flow On Stock Market
---------------------------------------


Several top-rated biotech stocks are also seeing money flow. Leaderboard component **TG Therapeutics** ([TGTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGTX)) fell near 3% in light volume. But after Friday's strong gain, the decline didn't look bad at all. The biotech first joined the Leaderboard list on March 3 and is a member of the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), along with 18 other strong performers in the group.


Five other biotechs to watch include **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), which is near the top of a 19-week consolidation. **GeneDx** ([WGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGS)) is trading tightly above its 10-week line after soaring last month on earnings, while **Alkermes** ([AKLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKLS)) trades tightly as it nears a first test of its 10-week line after an earnings breakout last month.


**Royalty Pharma** ([RPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RPRX)) is also showing strength and support after a near test of its 10-week line last week, along with **Axsome Therapeutics** ([AXSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXSM)).

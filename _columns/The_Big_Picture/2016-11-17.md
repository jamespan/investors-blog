Nasdaq, S&P 500 Face Tests Near All-Time Highs
===============================================

U.S. stock indexes rose Thursday, setting up crucial tests around their all-time highs.


The Nasdaq pasted on a 0.7% gain, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively. Volume in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) stepped up moderately on the Nasdaq but fell modestly on the NYSE.


The Oct. 13 distribution day fell off the count. After five weeks, a distribution is no longer relevant to current conditions. The S&P 500 now has only three distribution days, but the Nasdaq carries a still-heavy seven.


Distribution, which involves a loss in rising volume in a major index, points to institutional selling. The divergence in the distribution count between the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can be a troubling sign. Generally, it's best if strength is confirming strength. However, if the largely unexpected Trump presidential victory forced selling and buying because of sector rotation, then that divergence could be more innocent.


The test for the market now will occur near the all-time highs.


![mp111716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP111716-176x300.png)After the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pegged record highs in August and September, respectively, the indexes pulled off the highs in choppy action. The retreats never were more than 5% to 6%, but the market went essentially nowhere until last week.


The so-called Trump rally might not be due exclusively to the president-elect. Conviction has grown that a rate hike is coming in December, and Fed chief Janet Yellen affirmed that view Thursday.


The big money-center banks, a rate-hike beneficiary, have been in a general uptrend since early July. The cement and construction-aggregate stocks actually began rising smartly in late January, sold off after a July peak, and then began rising again in mid-October.


For IBD-style investors, an awareness of what's working and what's not is the key to getting a grip on this uptrend. While bank stocks continue to rise, the cement plays are pulling back. The pullbacks could give aggressive investors a chance to get in if they missed the recent breakouts. **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)), for instance, has fallen back into its 5% buy zone. **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) and **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) are threatening to pull back into the 5% buy zone.


In the past five days, chip stocks have been among the better performers. Gold miners and cement were losers. Widen the view to four weeks and the top gainers include steel, superregional banks and cement.


Individual investors should not lose sight of the stock market itself.


First and foremost, monitor the major indexes as they try to break through their highs. If they encounter resistance, then stocks will have a tough time. Investing is much easier with a tailwind. If they climb above and start making a series of new highs, then investors need to study their watchlists for breakouts.


If the uptrend remains in place, zero in on the strong sectors and strong industry groups and then the strongest stocks within those groups. Strength within strength will give investors a better shot at success than planting a hope on the weak side.


**Money Supply:** The Center for Financial Stability recently released the October figure for M4 Divisia including Treasuries, which is the broadest measure of the money supply. October came in at 5.8% growth, tying the June figure for the most in at least 2 1/2 years. The money supply can be a precursor to economic growth. The second take on third-quarter GDP will be released Nov. 29. The first take pegged Q3 growth at 2.9%.

Stocks chopped around, but ultimately squeezed out gains Monday, extending their winning ways. Thanks in part to megacaps **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), the Nasdaq outperformed with a 0.4% gain. Intraday, the index was off as much as 0.4% and up as much as 0.6%.

  

The S&P 500 bounced back from a 0.5% loss to end fractionally higher. Strength in transportation and apparel stocks offset weakness in energy, steel and mining issues.

  

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1% and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2%. The IBD 50 rallied 0.6%.

  

Volume dropped off across the board from Friday's surprisingly soft pace. Decliners edged winners by about 8-to-7 on the NYSE. Advancers and decliners ended pretty much at a standstill on the Nasdaq.

  

The stock market had a lot to chew on Monday.

  

Over the weekend, China reported a round of mixed economic data. The world's second biggest economy posted GDP growth of 6.9% in the third quarter, barely beating views. But industrial production came in weaker than expected.

  

In the U.S., homebuilder confidence climbed to a 10-year high in October, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

  

Earnings season is in full swing. **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) missed on earnings and sales. **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) and **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) beat on earnings, but missed on sales. After the close, Dow component **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) also posted disappointing third-quarter sales.

  

With about two weeks since the S&P 500 put in a follow-through signal, the stock market is making progress and volatility has settled down.

  

Other positives include improving Accumulation/Distribution Ratings in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. New highs are outpacing new lows. This was even the case in Monday's choppy session. (See the New Highs list on Page B1.)

  

Also nearly every day, top-rated stocks are clearing buy points. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Simon Property Group** ([SPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPG)), **Extra Storage Space** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), as well as thinly traded **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)) were among a few stocks that took out buy points Monday.

  

However, the major indexes still have potential resistance to deal with ahead. For the Nasdaq, it has to contend with its 200 day line, the 4960 area (of the Sept. 17 high) and the 5000 level.

  

Key levels for the S&P 500 are at its 200-day line and the 2100 price level.

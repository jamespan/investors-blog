The major stock indexes closed near highs for the third straight session in the stock market Tuesday. But small caps took another hit, and several top-rated growth stocks struggled below the surface.




After Monday's downside reversal, the Russell 2000 small-cap index slumped 1.3% and closed below its 50-day moving average for the second time in five sessions. Small caps tend to lag in a higher-interest-rate environment, but a big drop in the 10-year Treasury yield this week hasn't been much help to small caps.


Money has flowed into bonds in recent days as traders consider the possibility of a slowdown for the U.S. economy.


Homebuilders tend to rise amid lower rates, too, but the group fell 1.2% Tuesday. Several top-performing homebuilders are below their 50-day moving averages, including **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)), **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)). Just weeks ago, Toll, Pulte and other homebuilders had broken out of bases.

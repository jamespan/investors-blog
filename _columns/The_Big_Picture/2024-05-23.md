  Stock Market Reverses Lower Despite Hot Nvidia Earnings

All eyes on Wall Street were focused on **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) earnings late Wednesday. And, once again, the artificial intelligence juggernaut didn't disappoint. The hot earnings report sparked a stock market rally Thursday before the major stock indexes succumbed to selling, even as Nvidia stock skyrocketed to record highs and past the 1,000 price level.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.5% — its worst day since March 22, 2023. The S&P 500 lost 0.7%. The Nasdaq composite, which had been up as much as 1.2%, reversed lower 0.4%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 1.6%.


After Thursday's losses, the S&P 500 is up 10.4% year to date. That's the best first 100 trading days of an election year on record (based on available data back to 1928), according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. Thursday's higher volume meant the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both added [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). That takes the total on the Nasdaq two, while the S&P 500 carries three days of institutional selling.


Breadth was poor, with decliners over advancers by about 7-2 on the Nasdaq and 4-1 on the NYSE.

Dow Jones Movers: Boeing, Intel
-------------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) were the biggest losers Thursday. Boeing shares tumbled 7.6% to fall back below their 50-day line. And Intel stock lost more than 4%, nearing its recent lows and falling more than 40% off its 52-week high.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) soared more than 9% to notch an all-time high after the [AI giant beat Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-fiscal-q1-2025-earnings/) for its fiscal first quarter and guided higher than views for the current period. It also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Nvidia is an [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dipped 0.1% after coming just shy of a 52-week high. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) is approaching a 138.28 buy point in a cup base.


Stock Market Today: What To Do Now
----------------------------------


Following Thursday's weak behavior, IBD reduced its recommended market exposure to a range of 60%-80% despite a power trend identified by [IBD's Market School](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/market/marketschool) in the current market.


Most concerning was the bearish action on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Both indexes staged downside reversals from new highs. Both made outside days that saw Thursday's price range engulf the prior several sessions. That warrants more caution.


Investors can reduce exposure by selling stocks that have triggered sell signals, or that have given up key support areas.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is already dropping down to near its 50-day line and closed below the 21-day exponential moving average. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), which mutes the strength of Nvidia and other big stocks, slid 1.4%.


Notably, the equal-weight S&P ETF and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) both failed to hit new highs in recent sessions, a divergence worth watching.

Remember that a clustering of distribution days over a period of several days is particularly concerning. So, keep a close eye on Friday's action to see if the heavy selling persists.


In a sign of today's weaker market environment, there were only a couple new breakouts. One was Nvidia and the other, **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)), barely scraped the 704.84 buy point. While investors should be more cautious, remember that stocks with strong [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) could become market leaders, if they are not already.

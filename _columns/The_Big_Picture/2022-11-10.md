The stock market soared on cooler-than-expected inflation data in the Labor Department's consumer price index, in bullish action for the market.




In other notable action, **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) are stocks to watch, while **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)) illustrated the ever-present danger in the volatile stock market action.


Inflation Data, Treasury Yields
-------------------------------


The [Labor Department's consumer price index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-cools-much-more-than-expected-dow-jones/) showed prices rose 0.4% in October, cooler than estimates for a 0.7% rise vs. the previous month. Consumer inflation rose 7.7% year over year, lower than the projected 8.0% increase. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, also came in surprisingly softer, finally beginning to ease after hitting a new 40-year high in September.

Following Thursday's inflation report, traders now place an 85% probability of a 50-basis-point rate hike at December's Fed meeting, up from a 56% chance just one day ago, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html)


The 10-year Treasury yield dived more than 30 basis points to 3.82% Thursday, settling at its lowest level since early October. It was the largest one-day yield decline since March 18, 2009, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 3.7%, while the S&P 500 roared 5.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite soared 7.4%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 6.1%.


According to Dow Jones Market Data, it was the Nasdaq's and S&P 500's best performances on record for any CPI release day (based on available CPI release date data back to 1949).


Volume jumped on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and also appeared to be sharply higher on the NYSE.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) advanced 3.1% Thursday, but is still below its 50-day line, which is a key level to watch. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), solar leader **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) rallied 8.6%, approaching its cup-with-handle's 316.97 buy point.


Stock Market Uptrend Resumes
----------------------------


The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 both bullishly reclaimed their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) Thursday and will look to build cushions above that level over the next few sessions. Meanwhile, the distribution-day counts returned a more bullish level. Due to gains of 5% from distribution days, the Nasdaq lost its Nov. 2 distribution day, while the S&P's distribution days on Nov. 2 and Nov. 9 dropped off the count.


Not only did the Nasdaq and S&P 500 climb above their recent highs, but the session's higher volume confirms a subsequent [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Thus, IBD upgraded its stock market outlook from "uptrend under pressure" to "confirmed uptrend" in the wake of the CPI-fueled surge. That means that investors again have the ability to buy breakouts and otherwise increase exposure.


At this time, it's important to be flexible. Despite Thursday's torrid gains, investors should remain with a cautious posture, limiting exposure to no more than 40%. Wait for more confirmation of continued strength before adding more exposure. Immediate distribution would be a sign to stay more defensive.

Stocks To Watch: GlobalFoundries, Texas Roadhouse
-------------------------------------------------


[Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/gfs-stock-globalfoundries-is-stock-of-the-day/), GlobalFoundries is trading about 5% away from a 66.06 buy point in a cup base following this week's rally. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [GFS stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-globalfoundries-gfs.aspx) shows an 86 out of a 99 IBD Composite Rating.


Earlier this week, GlobalFoundries beat Wall Street's targets for the third quarter and guided much higher for profits in the current period. Q3 earnings soared from 6 cents to 67 cents a share on sales growth of 22%.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Texas Roadhouse moved out of its 5% buy area above a 95.52 entry in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The stock's relative strength line hit a new high in recent sessions, reiterating the restaurant stock is a market leader.


Texas Roadhouse has over 680 restaurants in 49 states and 10 other countries. While recent quarterly earnings growth has fluctuated widely, Texas Roadhouse has posted average EPS growth of 27% over the last three years.



LNG Breakout Fails
------------------


Despite Thursday's stock market rally, there is still plenty of danger in the current market environment.


Longtime [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Cheniere Energy succumbed to the recent market weakness, breaking down below its 50-day line Wednesday. In the process, the stock also triggered [the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below a cup-with-handle's 178.69 buy point. The stock was removed from Leaderboard due to the sell signal.

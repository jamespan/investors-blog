Nasdaq Gets Measly Gain; S&P 500 Loses All Of Its Advance
==========================================================

Stocks attempted a feeble comeback Wednesday as only one of the key indexes held on for gains.


The Nasdaq composite gained nearly 0.4%, halting a three-day sell-off. But the lift disappointed the hopeful and the greedy; the tech-rich index had squandered an early gain of as much as 2.4%. Volume edged up.


The S&P 500 ended off less than 1 point after being up as much as 1.6% a little more than a hour into the trading session. NYSE turnover eased.


![MP-021116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP-021116-240x300.jpg)The early gains were likely driven from a sense of hope that Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen would take the central bank's foot off its monetary brakes, given all the slipping and sliding seen in the Chinese, Japanese and eurozone equity markets. Yet judging by the headlines following Yellen's testimony to Congress, more hikes in short-term interest rates are clearly still on the table.


Regardless of what Yellen & Co. do in March, the market has been sending a consistent message: Corporate revenues and earnings have stopped growing at a solid rate, and valuations are getting adjusted. In the past two months, excellent companies with high P-E ratios have sunk like stones.


This is highly typical of a market in a correction -- and necessary. A brisk washout cleans out the market's speculative excesses, setting the stage for a new, strong uptrend.


Technically, the stock market is in horrible shape. As seen in IBD's "What's The Market Trend?" page, the 50-day moving averages for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been falling for nearly six weeks. The NYSE's advance-decline line is trending lower. Finally, as of Wednesday's paper, nine of the top 10 industry groups among 197 tracked by IBD were defensive, from meat products (No. 1) to tobacco (No. 10).


Highly rated stocks such as **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Jack Henry** ([JKHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKHY)) and even outstanding REITs such as **Physicians Realty Trust** ([DOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOC)) have all fallen on their faces after recent breakouts. So sometimes it's best to sit on your hands and wait for the howling winds to die down.


Stuffing your portfolio with cash is sensible even when secondary psychological indicators suggest that a market is near a major bottom. The fact that bullishness in the weekly Investors Intelligence survey has dropped again below 30% does not automatically trigger a rally in the market.


Real institutional demand will return only when the savviest fund managers are convinced of a turn in the economy and in corporate profits and sales.

<p>As the stock market extends this year's gains, these four leaders are in or near buy zones: <a href="https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard">IBD Leaderboard </a>stock <strong>On Holding</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON" target="_blank">ONON</a>), Dow Jones leader <strong>Salesforce</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM" target="_blank">CRM</a>), <a href="https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader">IBD SwingTrader</a> stock <b>Monolithic Power Systems</b> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR" target="_blank">MPWR</a>) and chip giant <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA" target="_blank">NVDA</a>).</p>
<p>Early Thursday, the Labor Department said that producer prices barely rose in June. The PPI edged up 0.1% last month, cooler than estimates. Year over year, producer prices gained just 0.1%, below Wall Street's expectations for a 0.4% rise.</p>
<p>The cool inflation data pushed the 10-year Treasury yield further below 4%, settling at 3.76% and closing at its lowest level since June 28. Despite <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-slides-to-3-easing-fed-fears-sp-500-futures-rally/">Wednesday's cool consumer price index</a> and Thursday's wholesale price data, investors still see a more than 92% chance of a quarter-point hike at this month's Fed meeting, per <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CME FedWatch Tool.</a></p>
<p>On the earnings front, <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL" target="_blank">DAL</a>), <strong>Fastenal</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAST" target="_blank">FAST</a>) and <strong>PepsiCo</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP" target="_blank">PEP</a>) reported Thursday and made big moves.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>

Fastenal slid 3.5% in fast turnover but is still above a rising 50-day moving average. And PepsiCo shares rallied 2.4% after the company beat estimates and raised its outlook. PEP stock regained its 50-day line and is building a flat base that has a 196.88 entry.</p>
<p>Quarterly reports from big banks on Friday mark the first heavy day of earnings season, with <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM" target="_blank">JPM</a>), <strong>Citigroup</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C" target="_blank">C</a>) and&nbsp;<strong>Wells Fargo</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC" target="_blank">WFC</a>) <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/jpm-stock-wells-fargo-near-buy-points-with-q2-earnings-fuse-lit/">set to announce</a>.</p>
<h2>Stock Market Today: S&amp;P 500 Hits 2023 High</h2>
<p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%. In the Dow 30, <strong>Caterpillar</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT" target="_blank">CAT</a>) climbed 0.9% and remains in buy range above a <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cat-stock-rolls-past-buy-point-amid-industrial-renaissance/">250.89 cup-with-handle entry</a>.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite both sharply outperformed the Dow 30, hitting new 2023 highs. The S&amp;P 500 advanced nearly 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 1.6% and sailed above the 14,000 level. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.9% for a fifth straight gain.</p>
<p>Volume dropped slightly on the Nasdaq and NYSE from the prior session.</p>
<p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) rose 1.5% Thursday. In the <a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/">IBD 50</a>, <strong>Allegro MicroSystems</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM" target="_blank">ALGM</a>) surged more than 9%, breaking out past a 48.82 cup-base buy point.</p>
<p>With the stock market at new 2023 highs, IBD's recommended market exposure remains at 80%-100%. Still, investors should be prepared for any potential market pullback. Make sure you take some profits into strength and quickly sell any losers.</p>
<p>There are three distribution days on the Nasdaq and four on the S&amp;P 500, which is a serviceable number.</p>

<p>On Holding is trying to break out past a 33.68 buy point in a cup with handle, according to <a href="https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith">IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition</a>. Shares closed just below their entry. If ONON stock retakes the buy point, the 5% buy area will run up to 35.36.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard">In IBD Leaderboard</a>, On's exposure was increased by a quarter to three quarters. The stock gained promotion from the watchlist as it crossed a trendline near 30.</p>
<p>Salesforce hit two buy triggers this week. First, CRM stock decisively rebounded from its 50-day line Tuesday, entering a new buy area. Shares then broke out past a flat base's 225 buy point during Wednesday's 2.8% advance.</p>

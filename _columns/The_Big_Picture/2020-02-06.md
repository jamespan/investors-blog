The stock market extended its win streak to four sessions Thursday, snapping back from last Friday's sharp sell-off and setting record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 118 points to set a record high after China slashed tariffs on U.S. goods.




The Nasdaq composite closed with a 0.7% gain. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also moved up 0.3%, or 88 points. The small-cap Russell 2000 lagged badly, falling 0.3%, indicating the market's riskier assets were not in favor. Leading growth stocks also were relatively weaker. The IBD 50 edged just 0.1% higher.


Volume was modestly lower on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, relative to Wednesday's turnover.


China announced Thursday it will [cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports in half](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-cut-tariffs-on-75-billion-of-u-s-goods-11580967540?mod=hp_lead_pos7). The move is part of the implementation of the recent trade agreement with the U.S. Later this month, China will cut tariffs on some U.S. goods to 5% from 10%, and to 2.5% from 5%, reports said.

Stock Market Rally Sets More Record Highs
-----------------------------------------


With all three major stock indexes back at record highs, the stock market uptrend is clearly still intact. However, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is a bit more elevated after last week's sell-offs; the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both have four apiece.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP020620-238x300.jpg)If your portfolio is still holding up well amid the slew of recent earnings results, then feel free to remain aggressive in pursuit of more gains. However, if your portfolio is in the midst of drawdown to due to the recent stock market sell-offs and earnings-driven weakness, then it would be prudent to cut back on your laggards.


Meanwhile, earnings results from top companies were mostly negative Thursday. Software leaders **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) [sold off nearly 10%](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/paycom-earnings-payc-stock-q42019/) and [7%](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twilio-earnings-twlo-stock-news-q42019/), respectively.

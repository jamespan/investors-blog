The stock market rallied into the close Tuesday, helped by falling bond yields and weakness in the U.S. dollar, on the day of midterm elections.




Sellers knocked indexes well off highs in afternoon trading after crypto exchange Binance reached a deal to buy rival exchange FTX to help cover a [liquidity crunch](https://www.investors.com/news/binance-to-buy-ftx-international-operations-as-liquidity-crunch-sparks-crypto-selloff/). Bitcoin was trading around $18,200, down 12.5%, just after the stock market close.


The 10-year Treasury yield snapped a four-session win streak, falling 9 basis points to 4.12%. Meanwhile, the Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ETF ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) extended its losing streak to three sessions after closing just below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) Friday. The fund is now firmly below its 50-day line and near the bottom of a seven-week consolidation.

The stock market likes falling interest rates and a weak U.S. dollar, and it is holding out hope for soft landing for the U.S. economy as opposed to a long, drawn out recession.


Mining, fertilizer and solar stocks led the upside, but actionable stocks remained hard to find. Coal stocks bore the brunt of the selling in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), with the group down around 2%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After jumping above its 200-day moving average Monday with ease, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied another 1%, bringing its three-session gain to 3.6%. Also noteworthy was that the Dow Jones industrials moved above Wednesday's high. The renewed strength comes after the blue-chip index broke sharply below its 200-day line last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve press conference.

**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) was the top gainer in the Dow, up 5.5%. The biotech was one of the first stocks to break out after the Oct. 21 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/). The buy signal for AMGN stock was when it gapped out of a consolidation on Oct. 24.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) also did well in the stock market today, up nearly 3%. The stock is in a new accumulation phase after a negative reaction to earnings last month. Several above-average volume price gains recently have boosted Boeing's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) to A-.


In economic news, the [IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-has-a-sinking-feeling-ibd-tipp-poll/) fell 1.2 points to a dismal 40.4 in November. The index has been in pessimistic territory, below the 50 neutral level, for 15 straight months. And the latest reading puts the index within 2.3 points of August's 11-year low.


The next big inflation report comes Thursday with the release of the October consumer price index. Overall, prices are expected to be up 8% year over year, down slightly from 8.2% in September. Year over year, core prices are expected to be up 6.6%, unchanged from September.


S&P 500, Nasdaq Extend Gains
----------------------------


After rising just above its 50-day line Monday, the S&P 500 added 0.6%. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Watchlist name and S&P 500 component **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) briefly topped a 308.34 buy point but closed just off highs. After hitting a low near 250 last week, Albemarle needs to take a breather for a better entry.



The Nasdaq composite pared a 1.7% intraday gain to 0.5% after the index met with resistance at its converged 10- and 21-day lines. Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included beaten down stocks like **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)).


It's not easy watching indexes head higher with growth stocks generally not participating. Leaderboard is less than 50% invested, holding just seven names. Be patient and wait for the best chart setups. Avoid chasing stocks that are up multiple days in a row. If more institutional money continues to come in from the sidelines, the setups shouldn't be far behind.

The stock market uptrend is still under pressure, which means exposure should be increased judiciously.


Two semiconductor ETFs gapped above their 50-day lines and closed in the upper half of their ranges. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) added 2.2%, and the iShares Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) picked up more than 2% also.


It's been an orderly pullback so far for chip designer **Impinj** ([PI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PI)), which gapped up powerfully last month after the company reported strong earnings. Chipmaker **Global Foundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) jumped nearly 9% and broke out over a trendline. It's still inside a 13-week consolidation.



Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.


The session did serve up a few breakouts, which is what you want to see in the early stages of a new uptrend. Contract manufacturer **Fabrinet** ([FN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FN)) jumped out of a cup-with handle base with a 118.15 buy point. A strong earnings report was the catalyst. Group peer **Sanmina** ([SANM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SANM)) also gapped up on strong earnings, although the stock was already extended from its 52.24 entry.


Meanwhile, a breakout for **Nasdaq** ([NDAQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NDAQ)) held up relatively well but NDAQ stock closed just below a 64.88 buy point after hitting a high of 65.66.

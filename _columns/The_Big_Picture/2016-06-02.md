Stock indexes shifted to neutral Thursday and then coasted to small gains, as they reach a critical level.


The Nasdaq added 0.4% with all of the gain coming in the session’s last two hours. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.3%. The IBD 50 rose 0.4%.


![MP_060216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP_060216.jpg)Closes were high in the day's range, which is bullish. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and inched up slightly on the NYSE.


The market had plenty of reasons to stand back with a full plate of data due Friday. Nonfarm payrolls, the unemployment rate, factory orders and two service-sector indexes are on Friday's calendar.


The market’s apparent willingness to wait for news is an important clue to its disposition. In the best rallies, investors are afraid of missing out if they don’t buy quickly. In the current uptrend, the bullishness is nowhere near that level.


From another angle, the worst markets are willing to dump a stock on the thinnest evidence. If a stock misses on earnings, it’s gone. If it misses on revenue and or guidance, mark it gone and gone. If it beats on the top and bottom lines, but only narrowly, it’s gone.


Generally, that hasn’t been a problem in the Q1 earnings season.


Let’s look at a batch of 12 companies that reported this week. Four of the stocks gapped up on results:


* **Cracker Barrel Old Country Store** ([CBRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBRL)) gapped up 8% Wednesday and then added 2% Thursday. Earnings topped views, but revenue and guidance were only in line.
* Apparel company **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) gapped up 7% Wednesday and then added 4% Thursday. The company topped views on earnings and revenue but guidance was soft.
* Heavy equipment maker **Joy Global** ([JOY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOY)) leapt 22% Thursday. The company topped views on earnings, reported in-line revenue but missed on guidance.
* Fiber optics company **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) gapped up 13% Thursday. Earnings and revenue exceeded views, but guidance was only in line.


Now let’s look at the two gap-downs.


* Digital video recorder maker **TiVo** ([TIVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIVO)) gapped down as much as 5% early Wednesday but trimmed the loss to 1% and then gained 1% Thursday. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue growth.
* Data storage and file-sharing provider **Box** ([BOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOX)) gapped down 11.5% Thursday. The company reported beats on earnings, revenue and guidance, but billings disappointed.


The other six stocks mostly topped estimates on earnings and revenue and reacted reasonably well.


Is there a pattern in this activity?


Generally, the market is reacting calmly and seems to be judging the stocks on a case-by-case basis. While this doesn’t point to a wildly bullish atmosphere, the reactions point to selective bullishness. There are few signs of the market insisting on perfection.


Considering that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are testing their April highs, prudence is smart. The S&P 500 closed above 2100 Thursday, but the battle might not be over. The index still has to top the April peak of 2111, and the prior highs represent potential resistance areas.


In economic news, first-time jobless claims were in line with estimates. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported the lowest level of planned layoffs in five months. Payroll processor ADP reported 173,000 jobs added in May, almost in line with estimates for 175,000.

  Stock Market Mixed After Another Cool Inflation Report; Chipotle, Coinbase Among Stocks To Watch

The stock market ended mixed Thursday, as Wall Street digested another cooler-than-expected inflation report. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose for a fourth straight day, but small caps lagged.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%, extending a losing streak to three sessions. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, and the Nasdaq moved up 0.3%, both posting fresh record closing highs. But the small-cap Russell 2000 index declined 0.9%, closing right at the 50-day moving average.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Early Thursday, the [Labor Department said](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-ppi-may-sp-500/) that initial jobless claims jumped to the highest level since last summer, while the core producer prices were unchanged, lifting the odds for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September.


After the jobless claims and PPI data, markets were pricing in 68% odds of a rate cut by the Sept. 18 Fed meeting, up from around 62% before the data, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Before Wednesday's CPI report, those odds stood around 50%.


Markets now see 69% odds of two quarter-point rate cuts this year, despite that the Fed now expects only one rate cut this year.

Stock Market Today:
-------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) was one of the biggest winners, up around 1.1%. Shares are about 4% below their 200.94 buy point but remain below the 50-day moving average.


On the downside, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) slipped 2.9% and has been below its 50-day line since mid-April.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) rallied 3.5%, hitting more record highs. And **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) raced nearly 3% higher after [Chief Executive Elon Musk indicated](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-elon-musk-pay-vote-passes-by-wide-margins/) that shareholders were poised to approve his $56 billion pay package and to reincorporate the electric-vehicle giant in Texas, moving it from Delaware.


A big earnings mover Thursday was **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). The chip company beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal second quarter. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. [Broadcom stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/avgo-stock-broadcom-fiscal-q2-2024-earnings/) shot up more than 12%, briefly hitting the [20% profit target](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from a 1,438.17 flat-base entry.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose 0.4%, holding just off its 52-week high.

What To Do Now
--------------


The Nasdaq notched more record highs Thursday despite paring gains. Amid the continued strength, IBD maintains its recommended market exposure range at 80%-100%.


But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are getting a little overextended from their 50-day moving averages, which suggests indexes may be ready for a pause or decline.


Meanwhile, the equal-weighted versions of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are underperforming their market cap-weighted counterparts.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) ETFs dropped 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.


While [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list was empty Thursday, there are a number of top growth stocks near buy points, including **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) and **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)). ELF Beauty was [Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/elf-beauty-stock-elf-beauty-earnings-massive-run/)

Stock Market Leaders: Chipotle, Coinbase
----------------------------------------


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Coinbase Global** ([COIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COIN)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) are stocks to watch as they trade near buy points.


[Chipotle stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/chipotle-stock-buy-signal-cmg-stock-split/) is rebounding from its 50-day line, placing the burrito maker in a new buy area. Meanwhile, a short consolidation has a 3,260 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Keep in mind that this latest pullback is the fourth since a November 2023 breakout above a cup base's 2,175.01 entry. That means that Chipotle is late in its price move and risk is higher.


Cryptocurrency platform Coinbase — an [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) — is tracing a cup-with-handle base with a 263.80 entry. It is a late-stage base, however.


Domino's Pizza closed within striking distance of a 542.75 buy point in a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) pattern recognition. And [Magnificent Seven member](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) Meta is tracing a cup base that has a 531.49 buy point, following bullish gains in recent weeks.

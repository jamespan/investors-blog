Stocks ended mixed Tuesday in a mostly quiet session, but it was far from quiet when it came to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and semiconductor stocks.

  

The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow opened lower but ended near session highs as buyers came into the market in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq lost nearly 0.9% early but trimmed losses to 0.2% by the close. The S&P 500 ended a four-session slide, rising nearly 0.2%. The Dow also rose close to 0.2%.

  

Apple shed 3% in fast trade, hurt by a Credit Suisse note that raised concerns about demand for the new iPhone.

  

Apple chip suppliers also got hit. **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) and **Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) slumped 5% each. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gave up 1.8%. It's been getting resistance at its 200-day moving average for more than two weeks.

  

The Nasdaq added another mild distribution day to its count, but institutional selling in the market has been well contained up to this point.

  

The Nasdaq's three distribution days show declines ranging from 0.24% to 0.5%. That hardly has the feel of institutional selling. Distribution has been equally mild in the S&P 500. Its four declines in higher volume ranged from 0.3% to 0.7%.

  

On the NYSE, advancers beat decliners by a small margin. It was the other way around on the Nasdaq.

  

Meanwhile, economic news out of China raised the possibility of even more stimulus in the country. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in October vs. a year earlier, below estimates for a 1.5% increase. The producer price index slid 5.9% vs. a year earlier, the 44th straight month of negative readings.

  

Along with Sunday's weak import and export data, the report strengthened the argument for further monetary easing to ease deflationary pressure. The Nasdaq gapped up powerfully on Oct. 23 after China announced a surprise rate cut.

  

Homebuilders did well Tuesday after **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) reported strong earnings before the open. Shares jumped 8%. It's back above its 50-day moving average as it carves a new base. IBD's home-building group rose 1.7%. The two other leaders in the group are **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)).

  

When it comes to the overall growth-stock landscape, things look pretty good. The IBD 50 outperformed Tuesday, rising 0.6%. Year-to-date, the index is up close to 10%, trouncing the S&P 500's 1.1% gain.

  

Large-caps in the IBD 50 like **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) are holding gains and trading tightly after breakouts. Other October breakouts are showing no quit, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Western Alliance** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)), **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) and **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)).

  

Several other names are setting up. **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) recently staged a low-volume breakout over a 557.97 double-bottom pattern. It's now working on a possible handle area.

  

China names like **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) are basing constructively. So are U.S.-based leaders **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)) .

  

Outside the IBD 50, **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) is holding gains after its bullish gap up last week. Its shallow, cup-shaped base shows a 155.93 entry.

Nasdaq Leads Stock Market Surge; Titans Amazon, Apple Report Earnings Late
===========================================================================

The stock market posted a strong performance Thursday, as the major stock indexes closed near session highs. Late Thursday, tech titans **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reported their quarterly earnings. Amazon shares dived, while Apple stock rallied in extended trade.




Stocks opened higher, partly on a surge in Facebook parent **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) following better-than-expected earnings.


Meta shares soared more than 17% after the social media giant [beat Wall Street's earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fb-stock-jumps-on-first-quarter-earnings/). The company's EPS fell 18% to $2.72 with sales up just 7% to $27.9 billion. The company's revenue and outlook missed targets. Despite the impressive bounce, FB shares are still about 46% from their 52-week high.


Elsewhere on the earnings front, Dow Jones stocks **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) were earnings movers Thursday. Meanwhile, **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) also were among the major earnings announcements.


[Amgen tumbled](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-amgen-earnings-q1-2022/) more than 4%. [Caterpillar](https://www.investors.com/news/caterpillar-united-rentals-earnings-to-highlight-strong-demand-cost-pressures/) slashed losses to 0.7%. Merck Rallied nearly 5%. [McDonald's](https://www.investors.com/news/mcdonalds-stock-dominos-earnings-mcd-stock-dpz-stock/) jumped nearly 3%. [PayPal](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-rises-as-earnings-meet-views-though-sales-forecast-shaved/) climbed 11.5%. [Twitter](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-stock-twitter-earnings-report/) rose 1.05%. And [Qualcomm](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qcom-stock-qualcomm-crushes-march-quarter-targets/) surged 9%.


Stock Market Correction
-----------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.8% Thursday, while the S&P 500 rallied 2.5%, though it is still below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Nasdaq composite surged 3.1%. And the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.8%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MP042822-260x300.jpg)The S&P sectors all closed higher, with technology and communication services the biggest winners, jumping 4.1% and 4%, respectively. Utilities was the worst laggard, but even it moved up a healthy 1.1%.


Top growth stocks reversed from sharp losses over the past week, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1.1% after briefly hitting a new 52-week low. [Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY))dived nearly 13% after the company's earnings missed estimates. Shares triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 705.10 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) entry.


Despite the session's big gains, the stock market outlook remains a "market in correction." Yet, it could be the start of a bottoming process. Thursday is Day 1 of a [new rally attempt](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on the Nasdaq and Day 2 on the S&P 500.


A rally confirmation could come soon, if the rebound continues. Keeping a watchlist of stocks holding up well in a down market is a good way to be prepared for the next stock market uptrend.


You can find many of the next uptrend's leaders while the market is still correcting, which can be done by using theÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.

Cheniere Energy Is A Stock Market Leader
----------------------------------------



[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)), for example, is one of the top stocks to watch after finding support around its 50-day moving average this week. Shares are close to finishing a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) that will show a 149.52 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


This week, shares of the nation's largest producer of liquefied natural gas moved higher after Russia moved to cut natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Per [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [LNG stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/amex-cheniere-energy-inc-lng.aspx) shows a modest 77 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Meanwhile, the stock's RS line made a new high this week, as the energy leader attempts to shrug off the market weakness.


Remember that the current market conditions are not conducive to new purchases. Still, the stock is holding up well amid the stock market's volatility, so it should be placed on a watchlist.



Amazon, Apple Report Earnings
-----------------------------


Late Thursday, titans Amazon and Apple reported their quarterly earnings.


Amazon shares dived 10% in extended trade Thursday after the [company reported first-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-plunges-on-earnings-report/) that missed estimates by a wide margin, as did its second-quarter revenue outlook.


Apple rose around 1% in after-hours trade in the wake of the iPhone maker's [better-than-expected fiscal Q2 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-apple-easily-beats-march-quarter-goals/). The company also raised its quarterly dividend and share repurchase program.


Early Friday, **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)), **Bristol-Myers** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)) and **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) will report their quarterly results.

Will Stocks Get A Second Wind Or A Pullback?
=============================================

U.S. stock indexes captured modest gains Friday, staying comfortably positive for the week.


The Nasdaq advanced 0.4% Friday to lift its weekly stash to 1.8%. The S&P 500 added 0.2% for the day, nudging its weekly gain to 1.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat, keeping its weekly gain at 1.7%.


![mp021717](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP021717.png)Volume fellÂ on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq, according to final numbers. Friday was an options expiration day, which tends to boost volume.


NYSE volume came in lower despite a huge boost from a couple of stocks.


Because of takeover speculation, NYSE stocks **Unilever NV** and **Unilever Plc** turned up the volume, trading shares at about 16 times and 20 times the previous day's pace, respectively. Meanwhile, **Colgate Palmolive** ([CL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CL)) drew volume that was more than twice Thursday's pace.


Some market watchers attributed Colgate's price-and-volume action Friday to additional takeover speculation, though there was no news directly involving Colgate.


The important take-away for investors is that the outliers made the NYSE's total volume misleading, even if a bit lower. Enormous volume in a few concentrated stocks does not say much about the overall market.


Perhaps more significant at this juncture is the price action of the Nasdaq.


The Nasdaq's pattern since Election Day has been a 5% to 7% advance followed by a mini-pullback of 2.5% to 3%. After the most recent short-term bottom on Dec. 30, the Nasdaq has advanced about 8.5%.


A minor pullback may be due, but markets have been known to bust a pattern and do something different. This could mean either a second wind for the run-up or a dive.


The Nasdaq hasn't suffered a pullback of 10% or more since the 18.7% drop from December 2015 to Feb. 11, 2016.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Distribution days can teach the investor [when to lighten up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/distribution-days-in-stock-indexes-come-in-different-shapes-and-sizes/) on stocks, but not all distribution days are alike.*

The tone of the current uptrend appears to have changed.


After the election, the Dow outperformed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 until the end of the year. But year to date 2017, the Dow has lagged.


What changed?


The Dow benefited from strong action from the two money-center banks (**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM))) from Election Day to the end of the year.


But in 2017, the two biggest gainers in the Dow have been **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), up 17%, and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), up 12%.


The interesting thing: Apple and Visa are growthier stocks than most issues in the Dow.

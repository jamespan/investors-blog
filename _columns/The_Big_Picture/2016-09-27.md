Stocks Rise, Recover Some Losses; Amazon Hits A New High
=========================================================

Stocks made solid strides Tuesday as the main indexes sought to keep a moderate uptrend on the right track.


The Nasdaq led with a 0.9% increase, wiping away Monday's loss. Chip and internet stocks, two classes that are well represented in the composite, laid claim to some of the day's best-performing industry groups. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), one of the winners of [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/), reached a record high. Chinese internets were particularly strong. **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) gained more than 5% and almost cleared its Aug. 29 high in active trading.


The S&P 500 rose 0.6% but remained below its 50-day moving average. That's an indication that the market is not quite running on all cylinders. Investors should regard it as the proverbial ounce of caution.


Volume rose across the board, suggesting rising institutional interest in equities during Tuesday's trading. On Wednesday of last week, IBD switched the current outlook for the market back to "confirmed uptrend" from "uptrend under pressure" following the Nasdaq's posting of a new high that day.


While the S&P 500 is still trying to climb over its 50-day line, the Nasdaq is above its own 50-day moving average and threatening new highs (see the dotted line marking the 50-day moving average in the daily charts provided by a PDF link at the bottom of this column). The composite also has fewer than half the distribution days as the S&P 500.


![mp092716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP092716-195x300.jpg)For much of this year, the S&P 500 had been the better-performing index. But since mid-September the Nasdaq has caught up. At Monday's close, the two were exactly even in year-to-date performance (up 5%). Tuesday's results gave the Nasdaq a slight edge.


What caused the shift?


Part of the reason is the outperformance by some Nasdaq-heavy industry groups. Since the market lows in late June, the biotech group is up nearly 30%; chipmakers are up more than 25%; chip designers are up more than 30%; internet content is up 17% and internet retail is up almost 20%.


At the same time, the flagging action by energy, utility and metals stocks in recent months has taken its toll on the S&P 500.  Since the June low, IBD's utility industry groups are down 1% to 5%. Gold and silver miners are up 3%; metal ores miners are up 6%. Integrated oil & gas has fallen 2% as a group, while shares in oil machinery and equipment are up 10%.


**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), a good representation of the large-cap energy sector with a market cap of $345 billion, peaked July 15 and has been trending downward. The stock on Tuesday touched the lowest level since April 7.
Tuesday's trading also produced a few relatively unspectacular breakouts.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), a cloud-based provider of business-function automation, edged past a 78.87 buy point in lukewarm volume. **BofI Holdings** ([BOFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOFI)) topped the 23.31 buy point of a cup-with-handle base but closed below the entry. **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) tried to clear the 720.10 buy point and also drew modest volume.


Health care, though, remained a hot sector, with another strong day by biotechs and generic drug companies. The chart of **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) has gotten quite interesting, as it shapes a tight pattern with a potential buy point at 333.75.


Biogen is part of the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), ranking No. 29 as of Tuesday. The index climbed 1.3% Tuesday as two Santa Clara, Calif., companies led: **Gigamon** ([GIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIMO)) climbed 4.5% and **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) 5.1%.


**Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) leapt 3.5% to a new high after the RV manufacturer beat sales and profit expectations. The stock is among some leaders that rose from pullbacks and provided the best buy opportunities this month.


Oil stocks were mainly lower. Crude prices fell 2.2% to just under $45 a barrel after a deal to limit oil output by the major producers was pushed back to November.

Nasdaq Leads Again And The Market Spotlights This 'News'
=========================================================

Please pretend for a moment that you never look at the news.




Â You get up in the morning, take a quick look at the [Nasdaq composite](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), check the stocks in your portfolio, then shut your computer. You keep the TV off. You refuse to scroll through any headlines on your smartphone. You avoid listening to anyone who is constantly reading someone else's tweets or searching the web for up-to-the-millisecond news.


Finally, you check your broker's website in the final hour of each 6-1/2-hour trading day to see how the Nasdaq composite finished.


Well, Wednesday sure looked like a pretty fine session, didn't it?


The open looked bad. At 9:30 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite almost gapped down vs. the prior session. At 7311, the premier index for growth companies already slid 0.8%. (A true gap down is when a stock or index falls so hard that the intraday high is lower than the prior session's intraday low, thus producing the "gap.")


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP_sq_03071818-219x300.png)That turned out to be the low for the day. The next several hours saw the tech-centered index and the rest of Wall Street gyrate from slightly positive ground to negative territory. However, at around the lunch hour in New York, the bargain hunters took over. Stocks made a steady climb and the Nasdaq finished its fourth up day in a row, reversing that 0.8% drop into a 0.3% gain.


The S&P 500 was not so fortunate, but it did turn an early 1% fall into a piddly loss. More important: Like the Nasdaq, the large-cap benchmark overcame a weak open and finished strong.


What's more, volume edged higher on the Nasdaq. This means mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, pension funds, college endowments, sovereign wealth funds and the like were more eager to scoop up equities than they were to dump shares.


Such action is the real news of the day. The general market acted in a way that it should when the general direction remains in an uptrend.


Small caps reaffirmed the market's underlying strength. The S&P SmallCap 600 finished 0.7% higher and ended almost at session highs. Again, weak open, strong finish. The Russell 2000 rallied 0.8%.


In reality, in the information age, investors cannot avoid coming into contact with mainstream news. And these past few days, there's been plenty [coming out of the White House](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-tariffs-may-exempt-canada-mexico-white-house-says-nasdaq-rallies-dow-jones-sp-500-pare-losses/). Reports that former Goldman Sachs banker Gary Cohn is leaving President Trump's team of esteemed economic advisors stunned global markets and sent equity index futures plummeting after hours on Tuesday. Investors around the world are still grappling with the potential impact that U.S. tariffs on two heavily used industrial metals will have on trade and the global economy.


After Wednesday's close, news wires reported that a ceremony to make steel and aluminum tariffs official is set to take place on Thursday afternoon.


Yet ultimately, savvy growth investors will make sound decisions based on changes, or lack of change, in the overall trend of the market; on the performance of his or her stocks; and with the help of a ruthless commitment to keep the best performers in the portfolio and to kick out the laggards based on the [golden rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


If you're a stockpicker and you do a good job of cutting your losses as well as avoid over-trading, then you'll like this stat: The IBD Mutual Fund Index through Wednesday is up a handsome 5.3% year to date, crushing a 0.3% gain for the Dow industrials and a 2% lift for the S&P 500. Only the Nasdaq composite is doing better, up 7.1% since Jan. 1. (See all of these charts via the General Market Indicators link at the bottom of this story.)


The IBD Mutual Fund index essentially assembles some of the very best stockpickers in the mutual fund arena, including portfolio managers and teams of managers and their research teams from Alger, American Century, Columbia, Fidelity, FPA, Franklin, Invesco, Janus, Oppenheimer, T. Rowe Price, Vanguard and others.


The Big Picture and the Market Pulse table are every IBD investor's ultimate warning sensors to heavy institutional profit-taking. Right now, we're at a sort of Code Yellow status given that the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have both registered four significant drops in higher volume in just the past two weeks.


On the Nasdaq's side, the average decline among the quartet of distribution days on Feb. 21 and Feb. 27 through March 1 was a meaty 0.9%. On the S&P 500, the average decline was almost 1.1%.

However, the market is showing multiple points of positive technicals.


The new-highs list continues to get stuffed with stocks in dynamic growth sectors, such as software and finance. In Wednesday's edition, 160 Nasdaq issues made IBD's screened list of all-time or 52-week highs vs. 22 names sinking to lows. That's a bullish ratio. On the NYSE, 91 stocks hit new highs and 40 slumped to new lows.


As seen in [IBD's unique sector-divided new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-mar-07-2018/), Software topped all of IBD's 33 sectors. (See the entire list of 29 software firms by simply clicking on "New High" at the top of the webpage.) Banks came in second, Business Services took the bronze.


On the Nasdaq, winners trumped losers by a 9-5 ratio. Even though both the Dow Jones industrial average and the NYSE composite fell on Wednesday, the Big Board saw 1,496 stocks go up vs. 1,374 issues go down, according to early numbers.


Breakouts continued, including new [Leaderboard name](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), which showed that the earnings season is still not over.

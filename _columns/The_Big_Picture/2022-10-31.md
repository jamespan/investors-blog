Stock Market Steps Back In Orderly Fashion Ahead Of Fed Meeting; 4 Bullish Chart Setups To Watch
=================================================================================================

The stock market took a step back Monday ahead of the start of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting. But it wasn't such a bad session for the bulls because it was an orderly decline for the stock indexes, and volume wasn't overwhelming to the downside.




Sentiment was negative in the stock market as the U.S. dollar strengthened. The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) gapped up after finding support at the 50-day moving average last week. UUP tacked on 0.8% Monday.


Money flowed out of bonds, sending yields higher. Just after 4 p.m. ET, the 10-year Treasury yield was trading around 4.06%, up 5 basis points. It traded as high as 4.08%. After a sharp pullback last week, the 10-year yield is getting support at its 21-day exponential moving average.

The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points again to a range of 3.75% to 4%. But the odds for another  75-basis-point hike at the December meeting have been heading lower after a Wall Street Journal story noted that several committee members are concerned about overtightening.


A hawkish tone is still possible from the Fed, but the stock market seems to be growing more confident that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed after this week's meeting are less likely.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite traded in a tight range all day and held above short-term support levels. It fell 1% in lower volume, so the index avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by 5-to-4.


There's only one distribution day on the Nasdaq since the Oct. 21 follow-through day. The Nasdaq's sole distribution day occurred on Oct. 26 when the index fell 2% in higher volume.


Increasing distribution days in the stock market — especially when they start to cluster — usually cause problems for an uptrend. But they've been kept at bay so far, and the action in individual stocks has been improving as more money comes in from the sidelines. If you're still lightly invested — say below 50% like [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) — that's fine.


If the confirmed uptrend has staying power, new leaders and setups will continue to emerge. Keep your eyes peeled on the IBD 50 and the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) for opportunities to increase exposure.


It's especially noteworthy that many recent earnings gap-ups in price have been holding, including **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), **Calix** ([CALX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALX)), **Idex** ([IEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IEX)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)).

And recent breakouts from the likes of **Raymond James Financial** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)), **Rollins** ([ROL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROL)), **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) and **Arch Capital** ([ACGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACGL)) still look good.



Current setups in the stock market to watch include **Clean Harbors** ([CLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLH)), **Home BancShares** ([HOMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOMB)), **B.J.'s Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)) and **W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)).


Dow Jones Movers
----------------


After surging above its 200-day moving average Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4%. The blue-chip index closed off lows after touching its 200-day line. The Dow Jones rose 14% in October, it's best monthly gain since January 1976, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was a drag on the Dow Jones industrials, down 2%, hurt in part by an earnings sell-off for **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)). Separately, Citigroup maintained a neutral rating on INTC stock and lowered its price target to 27 from 30.


**Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) outperformed in the Dow Jones, up 1.4%. It's near the top of a long consolidation that started in late March. But after four straight weekly gains — and another one taking shape this week — TRV stock could use a breather.


Dow Jones stock **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) touched a new high, rising 0.7% in light volume. The managed care firm is near the top of a base with a 553.23 buy point.



After jumping above its 50-day line Friday, the S&P 500 also showed constructive action, falling just over 0.7% after soaring 2.5% Friday. Volume rose on the NYSE, giving the S&P 500 its first distribution day.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by less than 2-to-1.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) extended its winning streak to seven sessions, rising 0.1%.


Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), **Chart Industries** ([GLTS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLTS)) scored a technical breakout after last week's earnings report. GTLS stock reversed higher above its 50-day line Friday after the company reported a 204% jump in quarterly profit. GTLS also delivered its fifth straight quarter of 20%+ revenue growth. The provider of equipment to the oil and gas industry is in the 5% buy zone after clearing a 219.05 entry.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed, up 0.6%.


Inside the IBD 50, outsourcer **ExlService** ([EXLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXLS)) broke out of a 10-week consolidation in light volume after last week's earnings report. Shares jumped 3% to 181.85, good for a breakout over a 179.91 buy point.

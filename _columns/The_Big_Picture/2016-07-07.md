U.S. stocks were mixed Thursday, as the major indexes skirmished in quiet volume.


The Nasdaq popped 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each shed 0.1%. The IBD 50 surged 1%, helped in part by **WhiteWave Foods**' ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) nearly 19% surge on buyout news.


Volume declined from the previous session on both major exchanges. Traders might have been waiting for Friday's Employment Situation Summary. Volume is often quiet in the session before the payrolls report.


On Thursday, utilities and energy stocks showed the most slippage. These groups have been doing well recently, and the selling may have been due to profit-taking.

In the past 12 months, laggards bouncing off lows and conservative stocks trudging ahead have been the upside story.


This is not where bulls like to find market leadership. Fast growth, which is the preferred source for leadership because of the potential for big stock gains, hasn't been on the front burner for some time.


Yet, for investors looking for classic growth stocks, there are a few with strong fundamentals that have been easy to hold as they rise.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) broke out in April and is now 22% above the 603.34 entry. Earnings are expected to rebound 331% this year and 85% next year.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) cleared a 188.58 buy point in March and is now 31% extended. Earnings growth is pegged at 23% and 22% this year and next year.


**Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) broke out in March. The stock is now 48% above a 34.08 buy point.
The next base for Ulta and for Silicon Motion would be second stage -- still an acceptable entry.


For Amazon, its most recent base was third stage. However, this third stage probably deserves an asterisk. Amazon's latest base failed to undercut the previous base (which would've reset the base count at first stage) because of the wild trade throughout the market Aug. 24, when the Nasdaq dropped almost 9% intraday on bad news from China.


So calling it a riskier third-stage base might be too weak a case to take to a jury of chart readers.


Friday's big headline event is likely to be the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Situation Summary for June. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to rise 180,000.


The May report involved a stunning miss, coming in at 38,000 vs. views for 158,000. At that time, the Nasdaq appeared to be setting up to retake the 5,000 level but couldn't get above 4,980 after the report and soon retreated.


The last big beat on payrolls came in the March 4 release for February. Analysts pegged the number at 190,000, but the figure came in at 242,000. The Nasdaq was in the midst of its February-April run and kept climbing in the aftermath.


The payroll numbers don't appear to be so much a one-day rise or dive as much as it sets a tone for the coming days.


Friday's report will be released before the market's open.

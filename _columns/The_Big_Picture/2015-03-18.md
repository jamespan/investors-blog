Nasdaq Rises 3rd Straight Day As Fed Keeps Dovish Stance
=========================================================

Stocks reaffirmed the market's upward bias Wednesday with broad gains in higher volume.

  

The strength of market leaders was hardly in question as well. The IBD 50 gained 0.8%.

  

Observers of the Federal Reserve appeared both unsurprised and surprised by the U.S. central bank's announcement on interest-rate policy.

  

They were unsurprised by the deletion of phrasing used in prior statements that the Fed is willing to be patient before taking the punch bowl of nearly free money away.

  

Yet they also appeared surprised by the Fed's candor regarding the economy ("Export growth has weakened") and that a bump up in the Fed funds target rate in April "remains unlikely."

  

In all, commodity and other highly cyclical stocks led the upside as the major indexes turned small declines into substantial gains by late afternoon.

  

Small and midsize bank stocks fell as the prospects of immediately higher interest rates dimmed.

  

The Nasdaq composite rose 0.9% and nearly scored another close above 5000. The Nasdaq 100, a yardstick for the largest nonfinancial stocks on the composite, jumped 1.1%.

  

At least six components of the Dow industrials rallied 2% or more, pushing the blue-chip index up nearly 1.3%. The S&P 500 was up 1.2%.

  

Smiles are likely returning on the faces of most market bulls. The S&P 500 is firmly back above its key 50-day moving average. (See the chart on Page B2.) New highs are growing in key sectors such as medical, retail, leisure and software. And more breakouts are giving opportunities to put cash to work. (See **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) and **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) in Wednesday's Sector Leaders charts.) The former has climbed past a handle buy point.

  

Yet the distribution-day count remains high on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, and a few of those days exuded heavy professional selling. On March 6 and March 10, the Nasdaq fell 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.

  

The macroeconomic environment remains choppy. The plunge in crude oil prices and the U.S. dollar's rocket-like ascent make it more challenging for equity investors. Why? The high volatility in these financial markets most certainly will impact first-quarter corporate earnings.

  

That said, demand stocks that show consistently high profit growth. They are more likely to better manage the choppy conditions. Jazz, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and members of the IBD 50 have increased their earnings at a strong pace each year since 2010.

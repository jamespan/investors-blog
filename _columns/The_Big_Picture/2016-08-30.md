Stocks Fall Mildly; Small Caps Still Show Relative Strength
============================================================

The stock market fell Tuesday in a meandering session that underscored the indexes' search for direction.


The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and the Nasdaq less than 0.2%. Both closed at the middle of narrow trading range for the day, and in line with the flattish pattern of the past three weeks.


Volume rose, which resulted in a new distribution day for the S&P 500. (The Nasdaq's drop was too small to be considered a day of heavy institutional selling.) But as far as **distribution days** go, this one was unremarkable.


For starters, the S&P 500 lost not even a true two-tenths of 1%. The 0.2% loss qualified barely, on a rounding up of the decimals.


Second, volume was below average on the NYSE, typical of late summer doldrums on Wall Street and of the week before Labor Day. The rise in volume was practically effortless because Monday's NYSE volume was the lowest of the year. A few top-rated stocks plunged on bad news, but certainly there was no broad selling in the leading stocks.


The IBD 50 fell 0.3%.

Benign as it may have looked, the distribution day was the fifth for the S&P 500 over the past several weeks. That's a reminder that the market uptrend is under pressure, and that investors should be willing to quickly pare their exposure to the market, and certainly not increase it. Even with the uptrend still in place, having a cushion of cash makes great sense.


After a superb run in late June through July, the S&P 500 has gone sideways for much of August. The Nasdaq is shaping a slightly downward curve. In other words, the trajectories of the broad indexes are no longer upward, at least in the short run.


But small caps are still trending up, providing the market with a large pocket of relative strength. The Russell 2000 has been rising in a relatively smooth price channel since it topped the 1190 level in mid-July.


Exactly where the strength in small cap stocks lies is difficult to pinpoint. But one area is regional banks. Just like larger banks, those stocks have been rising on renewed expectations of an interest-rate increase. A rate hike would improve banks' margins.


There is broad participation in the small-cap advance, to be sure. In the IBD 50, more than half of the components have market caps under $5 billion, and they comprise a mix of retail, internet, health care and other sectors. But the question is, will the other main indexes follow the small caps?


Much of Monday's trading centered around news that drove various sectors.


Apparel retailers showed softness after some bad earnings reports. **G-III Apparel Group** ([GIII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIII)) plunged 21% to its lowest level since March 2014. The company, whose brands include Calvin Klein and Levi's, missed earnings views for its July-ended quarter. G-III also lowered its outlook. Longtime laggard **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) cratered 20% in huge volume after reporting a net quarterly loss and its 14th quarterly in a row of shrinking sales.


Shoe retailer **DSW** ([DSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSW)) slid 10% in 5 1/2-times average volume. The company beat earnings expectations but same-store sales fell 1.2% for the July-ended quarter. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), which has been weakening since it reported earnings late Thursday, fell deeper below its 50-day moving average.


Discount and department store chains also were generally lower; so were restaurants. The softness in retail came despite strong consumer confidence that rose in August to the highest level in nearly a year.


Airlines climbed after **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) said it hired the president of rival **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) for the same position. Fertilizers led after **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) and **Agrium** ([AGU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGU)) announced they are in merger talks.

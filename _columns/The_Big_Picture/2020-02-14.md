Stocks Today Hold Bullish Bent; 5 Reasons Why The Nasdaq May Hit 10,000
========================================================================

Nasdaq 10K, anyone?


More than a decade ago, when the market was still in a nascent recovery following the shellacking of Wall Street in 2008-2009, the notion of this idea sounded uber-preposterous. But after the past week's action, have you thought that it's getting closer to reality?




The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both waddled just 0.2% higher on Friday. The small-cap S&P 600 struggled, down 0.5% after marching higher four days in a row. The Russell 2000 clipped off 0.4%. But make no mistake: The Nasdaq has been in an Olympic-style sprint since the IBD market outlook got upgraded on Oct. 15 to "Uptrend resumes" after being in a pressured uptrend for 14 days.


Closing the session at 9730, the tech, retail, medical and banking-rich composite index needs only a 2.8% gain to reach five digits.

Stocks Today: Still A Confirmed Uptrend
---------------------------------------


Consider these five factors that may help smooth the upward path.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP021420-250x300.jpg)No. 1: [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) have got their game on. And since the Nasdaq is market cap-weighted, their influence over the Nasdaq is gigantic. Headed into Friday, the seven largest companies, including non-FAANG names **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), made up nearly 35% of the all-electronic exchange's total value.


No. 2: Earnings have been decent. According to notes by wealth management firm Glenmede on Feb. 10, with 65% of S&P 500 firms reporting quarterly results, the blended growth rate in earnings — including past results and current estimates — improved from a 0.4% drop to a 0.8% gain. Plus, the Street sees 8.3% EPS growth for full-year 2020.


No. 3: Leaders acting well include **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), new breakout **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) and **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) in the software space; **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) in the chip sector; and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and [SwingTrader stock](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) in health care.


No. 4: Market internals are still solid. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line rose sharply for a second straight week. New highs averaged 211 for the Nasdaq and 219 for the NYSE from Monday to Thursday.


No. 5: Wall Street is not giddy to the gills with optimism. This past week, renowned market research firm Ned Davis Research boosted its outlook to marketweight for equities, shifting 5% of its recommended exposure in bonds to stocks. The bulls vs. bears ratio monitored by Investors Intelligence, at 52.9% vs. 19.2%, does not indicate extreme optimism.



Fundamental Risk
----------------


Stay focused on the companies with outstanding fundamentals, accelerating growth and true leadership status within a top-flight sector. Avoid companies with shrinking growth. **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) showed disappointing action. As noted in the [IBD Live show throughout the past week](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), the firm had been showing decelerating EPS growth for three straight quarters ahead of its 9% profit increase in Q4 announced Wednesday.

Stock Market Starts Big Week With Modest Gains; Investors Face Multiple Risks
==============================================================================

The stock market started one of its most important weeks of the year with small gains. That may not last as Wall Street girds itself for several big earnings reports and a Fed meeting this week.




Monday's stock market was a quiet prelude to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 strolled to 0.2% gains. For the S&P 500, it's the best five-day rally since mid-March, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq composite closed nearly flat. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to rise also in the NYSE.


The Dow, which had been lagging the other major indexes, caught up and made a record high of its own. It topped the prior high of May 10. The Dow's most interesting stock was **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)). It rose only 0.4% but cleared the 55.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/research/chart-reading-basics-why-the-flat-base-square-box-show-bullish-action/). Volume was well below average and the relative strength line is slacking. That translates to low expectations for this [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


This week, the stock market gets earnings reports from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). Those five stocks account for nearly 40% of the Nasdaq and about 23% of the S&P 500. That's believed to be [a record concentration](https://www.barrons.com/articles/big-tech-stocks-sp-500-51627312933?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D86767752584359609670535559432365936577%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1627332451) of assets at the top of the S&P 500.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP_6x4_072621-243x300.jpg)Their impact on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. The five largest stocks alone accounted for half of the S&P technology sector's returns from June 2016 to May 2021, according to ETF firm ProShares. Ten stocks accounted for 70% of the sector's returns.


Big 5 Stocks A Big Stock Market Influence
-----------------------------------------


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) report earnings Tuesday after the close. [Expectations are high for Apple to beat estimates,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-pricing-in-june-quarter-beat-strong-iphone-13-launch/) with 5G phone upgrades providing a tailwind. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) reports results Wednesday after the close.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose more than 1% to 3,699.82 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to 4,850 from 4,000. The firm maintained an outperform rating. There's speculation that [Amazon may venture into cryptocurrencies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-jumps-20-to-a-six-week-high-11627287544).Â Amazon.com reports earnings Thursday after the close.


The stock broke out July 6 from a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and is nearly extended from the 3,524.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


Because so much stock market wealth is concentrated in those five companies, their results will no doubt influence this week's trading.



Also Wednesday, the Federal Reserve concludes [a two-day policy meeting](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). The stock market is concerned that the Fed will make a move on asset purchases or interest rates as the U.S. economy continues to rebound. Its policy statement and Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks grow in significance with each passing meeting.


If the market didn't face enough risks, the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is still high. The S&P 500 has a half dozen and the Nasdaq four. However, few of these declines in higher volume carried real bite.


Stock Market Risks
------------------


On Friday, after indexes made new highs, IBD [changed its market outlook back to "confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-closes-week-with-solid-gains-roku-snap-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/)." But as The Big Picture cautioned, the Nasdaq 100 is 6.8% above its 50-day moving average. That's where it was before the market's latest pullback. The S&P 500 also looks extended from its 50-day average.


The Nasdaq and NYSE show thinning participation in the market uptrend. The [advance-declines lines of both](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DailyGMI072321.pdf) haven't kept up with index advances to new highs. The Nasdaq's line lags quite a bit more than the NYSE's.


A resurgence of Covid-19 cases is another worry for the stock market. But pandemic-sensitive stocks performed relatively well Monday. Airlines, lodging and travel booking industry groups climbed more than 1%; restaurants added 0.4%. SPDR S&P Retail ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) rose 0.4%.


The IBD 50 fell 0.5%. Eight stocks fell more than 2%, though none that would be considered a sell signal. **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) made a bearish reversal, adding to a volatile pattern.


A number of growth companies also report this week, including **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) (both Wednesday), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) and **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) (Thursday). PayPal, Align and Tempur Sealy are near [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).

Sometimes, a boring day of trading is just fine, and that's what investors got Monday as the Columbus Day holiday resulted in quiet gains in lower volume for the major averages.

  

Leading growth stocks perked up, but major averages didn't move much in either direction. The Nasdaq added 0.2%. Note that Nasdaq volume has been getting lighter and lighter in the past three sessions.

  

The index ended just above its 50-day moving average.

  

The Dow outperformed, rising 0.3%. Its winning streak now stands at seven. The S&P 500 added 0.1%.

  

On the NYSE, advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners, but it was the other way around on the Nasdaq.

  

The IBD 50 rose 1.1% as nearly half the names in the index rose 1% or more.

  

Four words describe the market uptrend since the S&P 500's Oct. 2 follow-through: So far, so good.

  

A pretty good barometer of how strong an uptrend is the quality of the breakouts that emerge. To this end, the action hasn't been decidedly bullish, but pretty good overall.

  

A look at recent breakouts only reveals two big winners: **Universal Insurance Holdings** ([UVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVE)) and **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)), but the overall landscape doesn't look too bad when it comes to growth names acting well.

  

Two airlines in particular are showing strength. **SkyWest** ([SKYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKYW)) cleared a base Monday, rising 11%. And IBD 50 name **Hawaiian Airlines** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) extended gains after a recent breakout, rising 3%. Airlines were a beneficiary of lower oil prices. November crude oil gave up $2.53, or 5.1%, to $47.10 a barrel. Oil soared 8.9% last week.

  

One compelling facet of the market is the number of growth names that are setting up for potential moves higher.

  

**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), for example is working on a base with a 96.59 buy point. Earnings aren't due until Nov. 4.

  

**Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is nearing the completion of a flat base that shows a 758.71 buy point. Annual earnings growth projections still look pretty good (23% this year and 19% in 2016), but quarterly earnings and sales are expected to decelerate for the fourth straight quarter when the company reports on Oct. 20. Chipotle on Monday named former **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) executive Curt Garner as its chief information officer.

  

**Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is working on a base with a 1,395.10 entry. Nearly one year ago, Priceline hit a low of 1,017, undercutting the low of a prior base and thus resetting the base count.

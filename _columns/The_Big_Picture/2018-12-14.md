title: The Big Picture: Stock Market Bears Deliver A Thorough Beating To The Bulls

Stock market bears grabbed the spotlight Friday, pushing the major indexes down at the open and then digging a deeper hole for the optimists.




The Nasdaq tripped 2.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.9%. Blue chips found little protection as the Dow Jones industrial average skidded 2%. Small caps as gauged in the S&P 600 dumped 1.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE, adding distribution days to both major exchanges.


Distribution consists of a price loss in rising volume. It points to institutional selling.

So far, the distribution count remains low. Yet the market has an ugly tone. Closes low in the day's range have become common.


Negative reversals also have become routine.


Stock Market Bears Prevail
--------------------------


On Friday, the bulls hoped to serve the bears some of their medicine. After the Nasdaq dropped about 1.5% in the first 10 minutes of trade, buyers stepped in and cut the loss to 0.6% in midmorning trade.


The bears took over from there, kicking the market down to its ugly closes.


By now, the most stubborn optimists have little left to say.


The bulls can't point to many stocks that are working.


News-Driven Market
------------------


Much of the correction has been news driven. A strong U.S. economy has become a largely unread footnote.


The intransigence of China and the U.S. on tariffs has raised the question of whether a significant deal is possible.


Progress was reported in the past week on U.S. soybeans going into China and tariff reductions on U.S. autos. The stock market, though, didn't get much traction from those steps.


On Friday, President Trump tweeted that "China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen, and rather soon!"


Meanwhile, China's retail sales showed the slowest growth in 15 years. The weakness could improve the odds for a deal with China. Tariffs are an economic depressant, according to most economists, but the U.S. is in better shape to handle the punishment than China.


Coming Up: The Fed's December Show
----------------------------------


Another factor affecting this market is interest rates.


The Federal Reserve will hold its December meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Most market watchers are expecting the Fed to raise rates a quarter point to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%.


CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the odds for an increase at 74.9% and the chance for no change at 25.1%.

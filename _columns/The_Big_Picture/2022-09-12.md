The stock market continued to firm up its rebound with a fourth consecutive gain Monday, when indexes surpassed some important markers. But now comes the big economic report.




The Nasdaq composite climbed almost 1.3%, adding some space above its 50-day moving average. On Friday the index closed barely above the line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed back above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/), as did the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)). The Dow climbed 0.7% and the "cubes" exchange traded fund (the QQQ's nickname for its former name, QQQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, rose 1.2%.


The S&P 500, which on Friday was the first of the major indexes to regain the 50-day line, added 1.1%. Small caps rallied also, with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%. All four indexes rose for the fourth consecutive day.

But the IBD 50 lagged, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) managed a 0.5% increase. Energy, fertilizer and some cyclical stocks hit the index the most.


Europe Indexes Climb On Ukraine News
------------------------------------


European indexes rallied on news that Ukraine made further inroads in [pushing back Russian forces](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-withdraws-more-forces-from-northeast-ukraine-as-kyiv-presses-advance-11662980194?mod=hp_lead_pos1). The Wall Street Journal reported that Russian troops retreated from parts of northeastern Ukraine. The German DAX index jumped 2.4%, the London FTSE 100 climbed 1.7% and the Paris CAC 40 rose 2%.


Defense, agricultural and other war-related stocks fell. In fact, **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) were two of the weakest S&P 500 stocks Monday, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


With Monday's gains, the U.S. stock market is building on last week's rebound, which snapped a three-week losing streak. Despite that weak spell, the 50-day lines of the main indexes have been rising for several weeks now.


The S&P 500 climbed more than 5% from its Sept. 6 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which removed that date from the distribution count. That leaves a still-high five days of higher-volume declines on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Stock Market Calm Ahead Of CPI
------------------------------


If investors are apprehensive about Tuesday's consumer price index report, they weren't showing it Monday. Yet, the CPI is the main event in this week's trading, acting as a weather vane for the Fed to chart its course on interest rates.


[Economists expect](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=541684&cust=ibd&year=2022&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) August inflation to have climbed 8% on an annual basis with a 0.1% dip from the previous month. The consensus estimate for core prices (excluding food and energy) is 6.1% higher and up 0.3% from the previous month.


On the eve of the CPI data, two private price gauges showed moderating prices. One managed by [State Street Global Markets](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-showed-signs-of-easing-in-several-industries-in-august-11662888602) tracks multiple industries. And [Adobe's tracker of online prices](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/Adobe-Digital-Price-Index-Online-Inflation-Rises-in-August-to-0.4-/default.aspx) also showed moderation, with groceries and apparel accounting for a big part of higher consumer prices.


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 4 basis points to 3.36%. And the 2-year Treasury rose to 3.57%, the highest since November 2007, says Dow Jones Market Data. Many economists expect a recession because short-term yields are so much higher than the 10-year rate.


Investors Expect Another Big Rate Hike
--------------------------------------



But investors are betting heavily on a three-quarter point rate increase at next week's Fed meeting. Odds for such a rate hike are 90%, with only a 10% chance of a 50-basis point hike, according to [CME Group data](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).


A surprise inflation report could shake financial markets.Â With such a critical report looming, investors would have done well to trade cautiously before the numbers come out. IBD's market outlook remains "uptrend under pressure," which suggests moderate exposure and raising some cash.


Stock market leadership has been fragmented, with biotech, pipelines, some retail and other industries trying to stand out. The energy sector is still a market favorite. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) ETF rose 1.8% Monday and its chart is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


The CPI report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET, before the stock market opens. Once the news is out, the stock market should have a better sense of its direction.

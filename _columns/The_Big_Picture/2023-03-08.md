Stock Market Erases Losses With Late-Hour Boost; Here's Why Stocks Are Tricky Now
==================================================================================

A surprise rebound in the final half hour of trading on Wednesday saved the stock market from having a real lump on its head. But the pullback, which began in early-afternoon trading Monday, underscored how the current road to a healthy recovery in stocks remains a bumpy one.




After sinking more than 1.2% on Tuesday, the start of two-day testimony to Congress by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Nasdaq appeared headed for a third straight decline. Yet after losing just 0.4% intraday, it erased that mild loss to end 0.4% higher and on top of other stock market indexes for the day.


The Nasdaq, at 11,576, also closed just a few points below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Big-cap techs did a touch better. Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq, closed 0.5% higher. That beat a trifling gain of less than 0.1% for the Russell 2000 and slightly more than 0.1% for the S&P 500.


Volume fell on both main exchanges.


Stock Market Today: QQQs Lead
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP030823-229x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a stock market laggard so far in 2023, edged almost 0.2% lower.


At 297, QQQ closed above its own 21-day line. Its gain since the Jan. 6 follow-through day? A spirited 10.8%. The popular ETF lost 33% in 2022.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) also outperformed, rising 0.8%.


However, as seen by the likes of emerging stock market winners such as **International Money Express** ([IMXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMXI)), breakouts are still tricky due to the high risk of holders selling into strength.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) in the Dow Jones fell for a third day in a row to 137.80, back below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and underneath the 138.76 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a recent five-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/?).


Despite small wins for most equity indexes, breadth was mixed.


Watch The A-D Line
------------------



Early data showed that nearly 300 more stocks fell than rose on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, 1,639 issues advanced while 1,561 declined, according to Thinkorswim.


Powell's comments on Tuesday and Wednesday signaled that the U.S. central bank is now mulling the possibility that quarter-point rate hikes may not be enough to accomplish the difficult mission of getting inflation back down to a 2% long-term target.


For proof, simply look at fed funds futures tracked by the CME Group.


The probability of a half-point hike in the fed funds rate to a target range of 5%-5.25% soared from just under 30% on March 1 to 79.4% on Wednesday. Bond traders now see only a 20.6% chance that at the March 22 FOMC meeting the Fed will push short-term rates up a quarter point to a 4.75%-5% range.


Doing so, meanwhile, would get the fed funds rate — or the cost for bulge bracket banks on Wall Street to tap overnight funds from the Federal Reserve — pretty much in line with what investors could get today for lending their money for anywhere between six months to one to two years.

Beyond Stock Market
-------------------


U.S. Treasury data currently shows a 5.25% yield on its benchmark 1-year bond and 5.05% on 2-year bonds. Ironically, the six-month T-bill commands an even higher yield at 5.34% as of Wednesday.


Given that stock market historians say the average total return for stocks runs at around 8% — think 6% in capital appreciation, 2% in dividends paid to shareholders — and one could reasonably assume that an exodus toward safe fixed-income investments like T-bills is increasing in likelihood.


Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, acknowledges that the popular mantra for stocks in recent years, TINA (There Is No Alternative), "has become TANYA: There Are Now Yield Alternatives." However, he warns that individuals should not ignore reinvestment risk, even if 2-year Treasuries can get a full 100 basis points more income than their 10-year counterparts.


"Investors need to contemplate that they are going to have to reinvest the entirety of the 2-year bond within two years vs. locking in a 4% coupon (on a 10-year note) for the next 10 years. Where might rates be in two years?" Schutte told IBD. "Many, of course, answer higher. But we remind those investors how they would have answered this question only two years ago. Hint: they would have said lower. Given our belief that a recession is likely and inflation is not returning to the 1970s, we encourage investors to own bonds across the yield curve at a minimum."


Gene Goldman, CIO and director of research at Cetera, points out that the "surge in the 2-year note increases short-term borrowing costs and puts upward pressure on the dollar, which hurts international sales." He added that the "net effect will likely be a further negative impact to profit margins and overall corporate earnings."

Are Higher Rates Better For Stock Pickers?
------------------------------------------


Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Bullish ([UUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UUP)) traded quietly on Wednesday. But it also kept virtually all of its 1.2% gain from Tuesday.


At 28.61, UUP has rallied 5% from its Feb. 1 year-to-date low.


Meanwhile, hedge fund research firm PivotalPath did a study of performance over the past 23 years and found that equity sector-driven strategies in fact can outperform when interest rates exceeded 3%. On an adjusted basis, PivotalPath found that the spread in performance during interest rate regimes of more than 3% vs. below 3% reached 13.28 percentage points.


The study covered a period in which interest rates hung below 3% for 223 months and rose above 3% for 52 months.


Jon Caplis at PivotalPath notes that equities in the energy, utility and industrial sectors outperformed by 14 percentage points when rates jumped past 3%. Financials also outperformed by a similar margin when comparing the stock market during 3%-plus interest-rate environments vs. below 3%.


Also, when "looking further under the hood at passive long-only benchmarks, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) exchange traded fund and Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) ETF also share similar characteristics of outperforming when rates are higher," Caplis said in an email sent to IBD.

Sentiment Indicators Update
---------------------------


Meanwhile, the latest [Investors Intelligence weekly survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) found that bullishness among stock market pundits bounced back to 45.2%, vs. 38.4% in the prior week, a natural response to last week's fierce rebound. This marked the highest ratio since a near-term peak of 48.6% at the start of February.


"Bulls in the mid-40s are not yet suggestive of major tops, especially if the overall trend is shifting positive," editors at Investors Intelligence wrote. The bears ratio slipped to 24.7% from 28.8%, with the remaining 30.1% of newsletter editors surveyed thinking the stock market is headed into an intermediate-level correction of 10% to 19%.


Alex Coffey, senior trading strategist at TD Ameritrade, said that even though higher interest rates have led to "an increase in retail trader/investor interest in fixed income products, that's not to say... interest in equities has entirely vanished."


Coffey noted the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index (IMX) suggests "there is still a lot of interest in many of the mega cap names that have been leaders of the market for the last several years." One reason: The FAANG firms "are well capitalized to weather economic hardships."


Net Buying In February
----------------------


"We can also see that, at least in the start to 2023, sentiment as measured by the IMX has shown signs of bottoming after reaching its lowest level since April 2020 in November to December of 2022," Coffey added. "The IMX has increased in both months to begin the year. And in February, TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers of equities for the first time since October of last year."

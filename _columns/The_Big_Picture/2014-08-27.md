===========================================

The major indexes made tiny moves Wednesday, and the Nasdaq ended a mild four-day win streak.

  

Volume fell on both exchanges, extending the current thin trading activity.

  

The Nasdaq composite fell 1 point. The S&P 500 ended fractionally higher to close a hair above the historic 2000 price level.

  

Small caps didn't move much, either. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down just 0.2%. The Russell 2000 also edged 0.2% lower.

  

So far, the market's latest uptrend following the July retreat commands applause. The large-cap S&P 500 has risen as much as 5.3% from its recent low at 1904.

  

The Nasdaq's gain has stretched 5.9%. It also continues to outperform the 500 since Jan. 1. (See the [index charts](www.investors.com/pdf/GMI_082814.pdf) on B2.)

  

Whether most portfolio managers and equity traders are still on vacation or going to head out ahead of the upcoming Labor Day holiday, the slow movement so far benefits the bulls.

  

Why? Those who read this column regularly know that on Aug. 13, institutional investors sent a message that they were hungry for shares. That day marked a follow-through by the Nasdaq. As mild as that 1% gain was, there's no question that the prior correction was as mild as it could possibly get.

  

With the market so close to its 52-week highs as well, it naturally would not take so big a gain as it might have required in say, the end of the 2000-02 mauling or the 2008 bear market to get the rally machine roaring again.

  

Ultimately, growth investors make money when there are good stocks to buy and they show the strength to hit new highs. That's happening today, even if it's at a relatively limited scale.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) (rebound off the 50-day line on Aug. 8), new [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) (breakout this week), **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)) (up 16% after retaking a 41.28 flat-base entry) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) (up 18% past a 90.84 three-weeks-tight buy point) all exemplify the market's current penchant for growth.

  

The IBD 50 dropped 0.7% Wednesday. Few stocks fell in heavy trade. The index is up 10.1% since Jan. 1.

  

The market's internals continue to show green lights . Winners edged losers on the NYSE, improving the look of the advance-decline line. In recent days, new highs continue to exceed 100 for both exchanges.

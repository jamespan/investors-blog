Stocks recovered from an ugly start Thursday but couldn't erase all of the day's losses.

  

The Nasdaq lost 0.5%, an improvement from a 1.5% skid early in the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%. The IBD 50 slid 0.6%.

  

Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE, slapping the S&P 500 with a distribution day.

  

With the uptrend beginning its fourth session under pressure Friday, the climate does not favor risk taking. Waiting could provide clarity. Since 2009, IBD's market outlook has on average stayed under pressure for four or five sessions before changing either back to uptrend or sliding into correction.

  

Which is more likely? In the past five years, the next move after pressure has been correction 54% of the time.

  

This might be a good time for individual investors to apply the 20% profit-taking rule. While that kind of gain has been rare in this uptrend, some stocks — oil issues for example — have 20% or greater gains from breakouts in February or March.

  

If you do cash in a gain, consider also selling your weakest stock. You don't want to trim the winners and hold onto to your laggards. Such action could eventually lead to a portfolio of junk.

  

Market watchers blamed Thursday's nasty sell-off on Italy's soft industrial output and suspended trading in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo over a missed coupon payment. However, this was not entirely fresh news.

  

Accounting irregularities in Banco Espirito's parent company were first reported in late May, which brought a yawn from the U.S. market. And although fear swirled Thursday that Italy might be entering a recession, Italy has already suffered two recessions in the past five years. The cynical might argue that recession is Italy's more natural condition.

  

After the indexes' quick drop, the market apparently decided the European news wasn't a big deal. The market began repairs.

  

Technically, stocks can be bought with the market under pressure, though caution is advised.

  

Look for quality stocks in top-rated groups. For example, India stocks have been strong this year. The Banks-Foreign industry group also is strong. And India's **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) could be headed for its first trip to its 50-day moving average since a May breakout.

  

A bounce off the 50-day line could define a buy zone. HDFC has a Composite Rating of 96.

  

The only other India stock with a Composite Ratings above 90 is **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)). The stock is less than 1% below a 41.28 buy point.

  

Gold stocks showed strength early Thursday but then reversed sharply as the market recovered.

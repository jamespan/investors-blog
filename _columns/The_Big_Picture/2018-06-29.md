Stock Market Kicks Away Most Of Day's Early Gains
==================================================

U.S. stock indexes whipped up some nice gains Friday morning but then gave them back.




The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2% in the morning but closed with a 0.2% gain. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each added 0.1% after also trimming gains.


Volume in the stock market was down slightly on the Nasdaq and, according to early data, higher on the NYSE.


The [stock market wrapped up the first half of 2018](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-next-six-months/) with a mixed score card. Consider the half-year moves, rounded off, for some key indexes:


* The Nasdaq composite, up 9%.
* Small cap S&P 600, up 9%.
* Innovator IBD 50 Fund, up 6%.
* Philadelphia semiconductor index, up 5%.
* S&P 500, up 2%.
* Dow Jones industrial average, down 2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP062918-274x300.jpg)The context was less positive. The major indexes rose vigorously in January and then stalled. The next five months overall yielded gains of 1% for the Nasdaq, a 4% loss for the S&P 500 and a 7% loss for the Dow.


The anchor weighing on the stock market is President Trump's tariff policy.


For bulls, the best outcome would be if Trump declared victory in the trade war and then moved on to more market-friendly matters.


On Friday, that looked unlikely. A report based on anonymous sources said Trump wants to pull the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization.


Such a move would likely send stock indexes lower.


Yet, government policy is rarely the main show in the stock market.


IBD's founder William O'Neil has warned against focusing too much on politics.

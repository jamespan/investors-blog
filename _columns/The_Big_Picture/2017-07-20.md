==========================================================

U.S. stock indexes coasted to a nearly flat finish Thursday, even as the major indexes pushed to new highs intraday.


The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was essentially flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was fractionally up.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and rose on the NYSE.


The win streak for the Nasdaq reached 10 sessions, the best streak since February 2015.


Technicals improved Thursday as the July 6 distribution day on the Nasdaq fell off because of price gains.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq now have four distribution days each, a sizable load but not enough to cause concern.

This is a good sign, and the IBD 50 is confirming the shift to quality. In the previous two weeks, the IBD 50 rose 1.2% and 4.4%, easily topping the major indexes in both weeks.


However, on Thursday conservative stocks were leading the market. The Dow Jones utility average advanced 0.7%.


Meanwhile, a bank stock finally made some progress on good earnings.


**Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)) popped 1.6% to a new high in volume 53% above average. The money-center bank reported earnings that topped the consensus view by 10.7%.


Other banks that reported results recently have not found traction, even when topping earnings and revenue.


Yet, the money centers have outperformed the market since the end of May. The group is up 9% vs. 3% each for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in the same period. Sell in May and go away would've been bad advice for the money-center shareholders.


The biotech is another niche that has done well since the end of May. The group is up 13%.



On Thursday, the biotech group rose 1%, according to preliminary data. Strong biotech performers for the day included **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), up about 3%; **Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)), up 2.5%; and **Emergent Biosolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)), which rose 3% as it broke out of a saucer-with-handle base.


The buy point for Emergent is 35, and the 5% buy zone extends to 36.75. The stock closed at 36.04. Volume was 75% above average.


Blue chips were mostly up Thursday, but Dow component **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) dived 4% in heavy volume.


News that **Sears Holdings** ([SHLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHLD)) reached a deal to sell its Kenmore appliances through **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) depressed rivals.


In another good sign for the market, the IBD Mutual Fund Index continues to poke to new highs.


Economic News Thursday
----------------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 233,000 â€” below the range of estimates that ran from 240,000 to 250,000.


The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook gauge for July came in at 19.5, falling short of the consensus estimate of 22 and pointing to a slowdown in growth in the Philadelphia region.


Leading indicators for June pegged a 0.6% gain, topping the Street's view for 0.4%.


Friday will be a slow day for economic news, but company reports for the earnings season will continue.


Companies reporting quarterly results Friday include **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), **Honeywell International** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)).


**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) reported quarterly results after the closing bell Thursday. The payment processor topped estimates on earnings and revenue. After hours, Visa rose more than 1%.

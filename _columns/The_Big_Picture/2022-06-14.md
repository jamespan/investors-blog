A stock market rebound failed to materialize Tuesday after three straight sessions of violent selling in the major stock indexes.




After plunging 10.6% in the prior three sessions, the Nasdaq composite eked out a 0.2% gain in the stock market today. The Nasdaq on Monday undercut its May 20 low, paving the way for a potential test of its September 2020 low of 10,519.


[Chinese stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) rebounded after Monday's sell-off and were among the best performers in the Nasdaq 100. **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) led the way, up 12%. **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) ended with gains ranging from 4% to 7%.


The S&P 500 extended its losing streak to five sessions, falling 0.4%. The index could be poised for a test of its last breakout area in November 2020, when it surged to a new high.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) were the top gainers in the S&P 500. FDX stock gapped up and soared 14.4% after the company hiked its quarterly dividend to $1.15 a share from 75 cents. It also added new board members to appease activist investor D.E. Shaw Group.

But ORCL stock closed off session highs. Like most other technology stocks, the software giant has a lot of [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) to work through. Oracle remains firmly entrenched below its 50- and 200-day lines.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 0.5%. Just like the S&P 500, it could be ready for a test of its last breakout area in November 2020.

---


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 0.5%. The small-cap index stopped just short of its May 12 low Monday, but undercut it Tuesday.


Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE. Declining stocks on the NYSE and Nasdaq outnumbered advancers by less than 2-to-1 in the stock market today.


The brutal sell-off in utility stocks continued. Among the 11 sector ETFs tracked by S&P, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) was the worst performer, down 2.5%. After falling 4% last week, the fund is down another 7% this week. Utilities tend to carry a lot of debt, which becomes more expensive to service when interest rates are ramping higher.


In [economic news](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), wholesales prices rose 0.8% in May, higher than April, but in line with estimates. Year-over-year, prices increased 10.8%, slightly below the 11% consensus. Excluding food and energy costs, prices rose 0.7% from April, slightly higher than expected. Year-over-year, prices rose 9.7%, a full percentage point above the 8.7% consensus.


10-Year Yield Jumps Again
-------------------------


After surging 21 basis points Monday to 3.37%, the 10-year Treasury yield added another 10 basis points Tuesday to 3.45%. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. Another 75 basis-point hike is expected in July as well. The question is, how will the stock market respond to aggressive rate hikes?


What we know right now is that the stock market is in a correction. With sellers in control for now, it's a good time to have a healthy cash position.



[Oil and gas stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) dominated the upside again in the S&P 500 until oil prices reversed. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures traded as high as $123.68 a barrel, but settled at $118.93 a barrel, down 1.7%. Meanwhile, natural gas plummeted 16.5% on news repairs to a fire-damaged Freeport liquid natural gas terminal in Texas won't be completed until later this year. The result is excess supply as LNG that was supposed to go overseas stays in the U.S.


The energy sector continues to provide stock market leadership, and the leadership could continue, judging by the performance of several leading oil and gas producers.


Names like **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) and **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) continue to hold above their 50-day lines, while **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) is back in buy range from a 148.09 entry. During Monday's stock market rout, FANG closed well off session lows.


Other fast-growing names in the group are simply testing their 21-day exponential moving averages, including **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)), **Matador Resources** ([MTDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTDR)) and **PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)).

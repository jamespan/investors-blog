  Small Caps Lead Bulls, Stock Market Humbles Bears; What Caused Recent Volatility?

The U.S. stock market put on a good show Friday, overcoming whichever culprit was behind the recent pullback.




Small caps led the day's rally, as the Russell 2000 advanced 2.2%. The Nasdaq chipped in 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average trailed with gains of 1.4% and 1.2% respectively.


Volume in the stock market today ran lower despite the options expirations day, which normally boosts volume.


The stock market's recent struggles might look like a multiple choice test. Did the market decline because of:


**A)**    The inversion of the yield curve


**B)**    China's continued inflexibility vs. President Trump on trade


**C)**    Both of the above


**D)**    None of the above


The D choice isn't as outlandish as it might initially sound. Some market watchers say that algorithmic trading is always a suspect and one that seldom attracts much attention. Built on esoteric mathematical formulas, programmed trading kicks in on the downside and in on the upside without any details.


Bulls would actually prefer to blame algorithmic trading. It implies that whatever signaled thumbs-down will eventually signal thumbs-up.


Nothing New

The yield curve, as measured by the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield vs. the 1-year bond yield, first inverted Aug. 1.


Although the 10-year and 2-year are more frequently used, research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank found that the 10-year and the 1-year have a better track record in predicting recessions.


Groups Up In Stock Market
-------------------------


Among IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), solar, specialty steel, transportation equipment and chip designers made strong moves up. Gold miners and insurance showed weakness.


Industry groups that were up both Friday and for the week included semiconductors, auto and truck parts, and education software.


Groups down Friday and down for the week included gold miners and insurance.

  Stock Market Pulls Back Sharply On Inflation Worries; Fed Statement Looms Large

The stock market took a step back Tuesday as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting got underway. Sentiment turned negative in premarket trading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment cost index came in at 1.2% in the first quarter, above the 0.9% consensus estimate.




The data kept concerns about stubbornly high inflation on the front burner and sent the 10-year Treasury yield up 7 basis points to around 4.68%.


The Federal Reserve is expected to stand pat on interest rates when its meeting concludes Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. According to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), futures traders think the first rate cut will come at the September meeting. But even that's not a sure thing because at one point Tuesday, the chances were just under 50% for a September rate cut.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps took the hardest hit on the final trading of April, with the Russell 2000 down 2.1%. For the month, the index lost just over 7% — its worst month since September 2022.

**Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) is the heaviest-weighted stock in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)). Super Micro reversed lower for a loss of 3.5% ahead of its earnings report after the close. Shares were down nearly 7% in extended trading after the [company missed on revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/smci-stock-super-micro-fiscal-q3-2024-earnings/). Full-year earnings guidance was above expectations, and the midpoint of the company's full-year revenue guidance was above the consensus estimate.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) were other notable earnings movers in after-hours trading. Amazon added 2.5% on an [earnings and revenue beat](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-gains-on-earnings-beat-strong-cloud-growth/), but AMD slumped more than 3% after reporting [Q1 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-q1-2024-earnings/) in line with expectations.


After six straight gains, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.5%, weighed down by big drops for **Hubbell** ([HUBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBB)) and bitcoin miner **CleanSpark** ([CLSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLSK)).


The S&P 500 dropped 1.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 1.5%. Volume on the NYSE was higher than Monday. NYSE decliners beat advancers by more than 4-to-1.

The Dow Jones industrials slumped 5%, its worst month since September 2022.


The S&P 500 fell 4.2% in April.


The Nasdaq composite fell 2% in the stock market today as selling picked up the pace during the final few minutes of trading. Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq by nearly 3-to-1.


After five straight monthly gains, the Nasdaq fell 4.4% in April. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their worst monthly performance since September 2023.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


**NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) was a rare bright spot in the Nasdaq 100, up nearly 4% after reporting earnings. The chipmaker cleared a double-bottom base with a 251.96 entry. It's technically still in the 5% buy zone. But after seven straight gains, NXP could be ready to take a breather.


A decisive move above the 16,000 level and the Nasdaq's 50-day moving average around 16,054 would be positive steps. But that could be a tough nut to crack in the near term.


For now, IBD's invested percentage stays at 20%-40%. It was raised to that level Friday after the Nasdaq composite rallied 2%. But the day's action fell short of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) because volume came in slightly lower than Thursday.


It doesn't make sense having aggressive exposure to stocks at this point, especially with the major stock indexes below their 50-day moving averages. The indexes are on downtrends until proven otherwise.


A weak market tends to take everything down with it, including stocks with reasonably healthy charts. In the [MarketSurge Growth 250](https://marketsurge.investors.com), several top performers fell hard in heavy volume after reporting earnings, including Hubbell, **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) and **Eaton** ([ETN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETN)).


Strong Q1 For Lilly
-------------------



**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) was one of the top gainers in the S&P 500, up about 6%, after the company [reported strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/eli-lilly-stock-eli-lilly-earnings-q1-2024/). The drugmaker also raised its full-year earnings and revenue guidance, helped by strong demand for its diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight-loss drug Zepbound. Lilly gapped above its 50-day line but closed shy of a breakout.


Earnings from competitor **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) are due early Thursday.


**Marathon Petroleum** ([MPC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPC)) was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500, down more than 9%. Before the open, the oil refiner reported another quarter of declining earnings and revenue. MPC flashed a sell signal with a decisive break of its 50-day moving average. IBD's Oil Refiner group was one of the day's worst performers in the stock market today, down nearly 4%.

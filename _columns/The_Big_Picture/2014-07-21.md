Stocks fell on geopolitical worries but finished well off their session lows Monday.

  

Gains in **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) helped cushion the Nasdaq's loss to 0.2%. Together, the three mega-caps make more than 8% of the Nasdaq's total weighting.

  

The S&P 500 also slipped 0.2%. Mounting casualties in the Gaza Strip and potential new sanctions against Russia had both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 down by as much as 0.6% at Monday's low.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 trimmed a 1% deficit to 0.4% after finding support at its 200-day moving average. The IBD 50 mustered a 0.2% gain.

  

Turnover dropped off sharply across the board from Friday's pace. Losers beat winners by a little less than 2-to-1 on both major exchanges.

  

Leading stocks down in volume were few, with some Russia-related stocks taking heat.

  

**Qiwi** ([QIWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIWI)), which provides online payment services in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, dropped 7% to a two-month low. **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)), the leading Internet search engine in Russia, lost nearly 4%.

  

Leading stocks up in volume also made for a slim list. Some were Chinese issues.

  

**Kandi Technologies** ([KNDI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KNDI)) extended its six-week win streak, adding 10% to a four-month high. The stock is just shy of a 22.50 buy point from a cup-without-handle base. This is the Chinese electric automaker's first base above 10 a share. The pattern is excessively deep.

  

**58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)) snapped a three-session losing streak and cleared short-term resistance at 50. Shares of the Chinese online classified ads company are forming a cup-with-handle base. But the handle is deeper than normal.

  

With a relatively high amount of distribution days and geopolitical worries causing a touchy situation in the market, this is not the time to get aggressive. Investors should be approaching the market with caution.

  

Book profits once gains amount to 20% to 25%. Both **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) and **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) are in profit-taking zones from their respective buy points of 94.25 and 69.51.

  

Don't let double-digit gains turn into losses. **Sanchez Energy** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)) has pared just about all of its 18% gain past a 33.06 buy point from a consolidation.

  

Buying stocks is still OK, but this is not the time to be loading up the boat.

  

This week brings another raft of corporate earnings reports, which may add to market volatility.

  

After Monday's close, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) sizzled on its blowout second-quarter report. It climbed well past a 602.31 buy point in extended trading. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) was also higher after mixed results.

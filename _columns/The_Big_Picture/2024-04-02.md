Sellers took charge during most of Tuesday's market action and drove major indexes down to key levels. With a retracement underway, investors should be on watch for the next support level.




Tuesday marked another decisive day in which the day's highs and lows were below the prior day's price range for the three major indexes. In early action, the Dow Jones fell over 300 points.


Part of the early damage resulted from the 10-year Treasury yield, which spiked to the year's highs a few minutes after opening bell. By 3 p.m. ET, it was up 3 basis points to 4.363%.


Volume was higher on the New York Stock Exchange and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time on Monday.


Breadth was poor, with decliners outnumbering advancers on both exchanges by nearly 3-to-1. The advance-decline lines for both the Nasdaq and the NYSE remain just above their 10-day moving averages.

Tuesday's 0.7% drop in the S&P 500 in higher volume gave the index a new distribution day. At the same time, however, the Feb. 26 distribution day dropped off due to time.


Despite a late attempt to regain some lost ground, the S&P 500 held just above its [21-day exponential moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) The Nasdaq also closed just above it after dipping below that level much of the day.


The Dow closed slightly below its 21-day average. Indexes have held support at the 21-day lines this year, so the fact the Nasdaq and S&P held those levels gave the stock market a bit of relief.


Still, the amount of higher-volume index declines indicates the stock market is struggling to maintain its advance. With indexes holding on precariously, productive [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) will likely be harder to come by.


Small caps also fared poorly, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.8%. The index has fallen 2.8% the past two days — the largest two-day drop since Jan. 31.


'Too Much Of A Good Thing'
--------------------------


Research firm Ned Davis sees the main indexes currently in a case of "too much of a good thing" rather than a more dramatic reversal. Chief U.S. Strategist Ed Clissold says that while the market is at overbought levels, the long-term bullish trend remains intact.


The S&P 500 is 12.5% above its 200-day moving average, indicating overbought levels after a five-month gain. In the past, there have been 13 times when the index rose for five straight months from November to March. Based on that historic pattern, the index gained on average 2.3% three months later and 17% a year later.


A near-term pullback to the 50-day moving average from its all-time high would result in a 3.8% retracement for the S&P 500.


In economic news, Tuesday's JOLTS report showed 8.756 million job openings in February. That was more or less in line with the consensus forecast and didn't provide respite from the stock market sell-off. New orders at factories came in higher than expected, at 1.4% versus views of 1% for February but that was after a sharp dip in January.

Nvidia, Tesla, Health Care Stocks
---------------------------------


Among sectors, health care stocks sold off on news that [Medicare Advantage rates](https://www.investors.com/news/unitedhealth-health-insurers-tumble-on-medicare-advantage-rates/) will follow earlier plans and increase around 3.7% in 2025. Insurers had been expecting an increase. The news drove Dow Jones leader **United Health** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) sharply lower. The managed-care industry group fell 5.6% Tuesday, the second-worst performing group of 197 industries.


Earnings triggered a sell-off in some retail stocks as **PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)) gapped down on flat Q4 sales and projected declines in the current year.


Among the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) fell 4.9% on [first-quarter deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-first-quarter-deliveries-expectations-are-rock-bottom/) that failed to pass even lowered expectations from analysts. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) also struggled and closed below 900. The stock has retraced an 8% gain from its all-time high of 974 and is below its 10-day and 21-day moving averages.


General Electric's [watershed moment](https://www.investors.com/news/ge-stock-buy-2024-new-ge-aerospace/) came on Tuesday as the company parted ways with its energy business, leaving only its aerospace division operating under the name **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)). **GE Vernova** ([GEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEV)) is its former energy business, while **GE Healthcare Technologies** ([GEHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEHC)) focuses on diagnostics and digital health tools.

  The Big Picture: Investors Focus On Earnings Vs. FBI Furor

You know what they say about a divided White House and Congress and how it affects the stock market: Not much.


The political news bombshell that was James Comey's firing, while in just the third year of a 10-year term as the head of the FBI, had Democrats on Capitol Hill in an utter uproar. Some talking heads openly wondered whether an expected backlash would hurt President Trump's efforts to cut corporate taxes and renegotiate deals with trading partners.

And quarterly earnings results are causing sharp moves both up and down in many of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.


The Nasdaq composite, boosted by gains in the semiconductor and game-software groups, edged 0.1% higher while the S&P 500 also rose 0.1%. The small-cap-dominant Russell 2000 outpaced big caps with a gain of nearly 0.6%.


At least 12 industry groups fell 1% or more, but the majority of these came from the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 industry rankings. They included the Media-Periodicals, jewelry, metal product distributor, logistics and RV- and mobile-home-builder groups.


Volume was mildly higher on the Nasdaq and slightly lower on the NYSE.


The key indexes may have presented a picture of relative tranquillity. But underneath the surface, fund managers bought big in some sectors of the market and jammed the exits in others.


**Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)), which posted excellent quarterly results and added luster to its gains from breakouts Feb. 10 and mid-April, led the game software group to the biggest gain of the day, up more than 7%. Oil and gas stocks rebounded on a strong 3.3% jump in crude oil futures. Yet crude oil has remained in a relatively tight trading range for months.
While bullish sentiment tracked by Investors Intelligence remains high, some professional investors see more continued upside in equity prices.


Robert Maltbie, president of the Los Angeles-based independent equity research firm Singular Research, notes that most people are overemphasizing how equity prices are at high valuations in relation to historical norms. The better approach today, he says, is to examine relative valuation.


If you look at the earnings yield of the S&P 500 using 12-month trailing earnings, at 5.1% it's still far superior to the 4% yield you would generally get by investing in corporate bonds that are at the lowest ratings among investment-grade debt.


"Everyone talks about historical valuations, but that's like looking at prices in a fishbowl," Maltbie said. "Based on our discounted cash-flow model, we still see 13% potential upside in the S&P 500."


Another reason to be bullish about growth stocks? Maltbie says that he is seeing a potential turn in the tide, in terms of money flowing into actively managed funds vs. ETFs.


After hours, **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) saw more than a quarter of lofty market value snipped after reporting a bigger-than-expected net loss for the first quarter. The net loss was $1.91 a share, even though revenue surged 286% to $149.7 million, extending its triple-digit-plus increases on the top line to five quarters in a row.


To put the Q1 net loss in perspective, Snap lost 44 cents a share for the entire year in 2016.


The member of the strong internet-content industry group dived more than 24% to 17.25, or near its March 2 initial public offering of 17 a share. Investors may have been concerned by the Snapchat website operator reporting that average revenue per user (ARPU) in Q1 declined on a quarter-to-quarter basis, to 90 cents per user vs. $1.05 in Q4 2016. ARPU rose 181% vs. 32 cents in the year-ago quarter.


As has been noted in IBD for years, a growth investor never has to deploy hard-earned capital into a company that is bleeding red ink, no matter how cool the products are or how hip the managers look. That's been the case with biotech companies during their strong runs in both the mid-2000s and from 2009 to 2015.


In Snap's internet content industry group, at least 10 companies show an EPS Rating of 80 or higher, and eight of them, including **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), sport a 90 EPS or better.

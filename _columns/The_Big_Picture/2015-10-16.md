Stocks got stubborn Friday, refusing to give back any of the previous session's big gains. The Nasdaq tacked on 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.

  

The IBD 50 added 0.7%.

  

Volume was lower on both major exchanges. The quiet volume was somewhat surprising. Friday was an expirations day, which tends to boost volume.

  

With the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 looking more comfortable above their respective 50-day moving averages, bulls are hoping the indexes will zero in on the 200-day line in the coming week.

  

However, even if the indexes rise above their 200-day lines, a third test awaits.

  

The Nasdaq could face a test at the 5000 level, an area that acted as support until it failed big time in August. And the S&P 500 could encounter a test at the 2100 level, which had been a battleground from February to August.

  

In the meantime, the bulls found some hope in Friday's breakouts among top-rated stocks.

  

Breakouts in strong volume included **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) and chipmaker **Microsemi** ([MSCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCC)) .

  

Another stock is close to a buy point. **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) needs a gain of less than 3% to break out.

  

Among IBD's top sectors, action was mixed. Apparel groups posted gains about twice the Nasdaq's pop. Building products moved up in line with the indexes, though homebuilders slipped slightly. Internet content stocks moved in line, but the network solutions group rose more than 1%.

  

U.S. economic news beat views. Industrial production fell less than the consensus estimate, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey was about 3% above views.

  

The big economic news is expected Sunday, when China releases some key economic data. Data on third-quarter GDP, industrial production and retail sales are expected Sunday. Results could have an effect on U.S. stocks and the global mood.

  

For the week, the Nasdaq advanced 1.2%; the IBD 50 and the S&P 500, up 0.9% each; and the Dow Jones industrial average, 0.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.2% for the week.

  

In the coming week, earnings will continue to roll in. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) will report Monday; **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), Tuesday; **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), Wednesday; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), Thursday; and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) on Friday.

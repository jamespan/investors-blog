The stock market is slowly building on its rebound, which broadened Wednesday â€” even if price gains were moderate.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6% despite a lackluster day for technology stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) was almost flat.


With the major Nasdaq stocks also making minor moves, the software sector gave the composite a boost. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) climbed 0.8%. Semiconductors were a lesser contributor. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose just 0.2% as its rebound moderates.


The S&P 500 rose just 0.2%, yet stands only 1% away from its record high of 4238.04. The index so far is doing a fine job rebounding from support at the 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was barely higher. Nasdaq volume rose, and turnover appeared to be higher on the NYSE as well.


![MP052621](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052621-245x300.jpg)With much of the stock market sleepwalking, small caps and midcaps took the leadership. The Russell 2000 surged 1.9% and is back above the 50-day moving average. The S&P MidCap 400 rose 1%.


Small, Midcap Stocks Lead
-------------------------


Small and midcap stocks have been going in and out of style, just as many sector have rotated in and out of the market summit.


Today, technology, health care, consumer staples are among the leading sectors. S&P financial, energy and transportation sectors have moderated after earlier periods of outperformance.


The rotating stock market makes it hard to stick with stocks longer term, but also makes [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) and shorter-term position trades a good option.


Advancing stocks topped decliners by a more than 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and by nearly 3 to 1 on the Nasdaq. The broad advance was good news for the stock market, and especially the Nasdaq. The index's [advance-decline line](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DailyGMI052521.pdf) has been trending lower for months, but is trying to bounce back for the past couple of weeks.


Market fear is ebbing. The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or VIX, continues to drop from elevated levels reached earlier this month. The index fell below 18 Wednesday. On May 4, 12 and 19, the VIX climbed more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, a signal of a market bottom. The May 12 and 19 spikes coincided with market lows.

The Stock Market's Wall Of Worry
--------------------------------


Indeed, fear is not such a bad thing for the stock market. Excessive worry often signals market lows, as it happened on the VIX. Wall Street, as the old saying goes, climbs a wall of worry. Today, inflation is the main worry, after multiple price gauges saw alarming increases the past several weeks.


One reason inflation is rising is because consumer spending is going through a post-lockdown surge. That's caused supply bottlenecks that also inflate prices.


Retail stocks also led Wednesday. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) surged 2.9%. In IBD's industry groups, consumer electronics, apparel, leisure product and specialty chains rose more than 2%.


**Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) exemplifies the rush back. The company Wednesday beat sales and earnings expectations while same-store sales about doubled from the year-ago period, when Dick's temporarily shut stores. The stock, which is in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), gapped up to a 17% increase. Shares are now extended after holding above the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) for many weeks.


Wells Fargo Investment Institute on Wednesday raised its 2021 GDP forecast to 7%, citing stronger than expected consumer spending.


"We have argued for the last nine months or more ... that pent-up consumer demand combined with the desire to get out of our homes and move life back to toward something more 'normal' would be a powerful force once unleashed," Senior Global Market Strategist Scott Wren noted in a report. "Many of us are seeing this play out not only in the economic data but also as we drive around our hometowns and see increased (maybe even back top pre-pandemic) traffic levels on the roads and much-improved foot traffic at our favorite big box retail stores, etc."

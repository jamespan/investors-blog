  Stock Market News: Indexes Reverse Lower After Fed Hikes Rates

The second day of a rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 looked pretty good for a while Wednesday as the market anticipated a dovish statement from the Federal Reserve. But the indexes looked a lot different by the close. In stock market news, software stocks powered the Nasdaq composite higher early, but a 1.1% gain faded to a loss of 2.2%.




The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each lost 1.5%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index dropped 2%. It's now more than 22% off its high. Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, as institutional investors dumped stocks again.


Semiconductor stocks lagged. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index plunged 4.2%, although chip designer **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) continues to show bullish action as it works on a flat base. It was featured in today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mellanox-technologies-acquisition-target/).


What The Fed Said
-----------------


Policy makers now expect two rate hikes in 2019, down from a prior projection of three. That sounds dovish on the surface, but futures traders weren't expecting any rate hikes in 2019. The market was hoping for an even more dovish tone from the Fed in light of softening global growth and below-target inflation.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP121918-277x300.jpg)Keep in mind the stock market is always looking forward. What's abundantly clear at this point is that the market is pricing in an economic slowdown in 2019 as well as a softer corporate earnings environment.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


The Nasdaq undercut its Monday low, killing its latest rally attempt. It's now 18% off its high, just short of the 20% decline that typically is considered a bear market. The S&P 500 is nearly 14% off its high.


While select software stocks like **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) continue to hold up relatively well, damaged stock charts in IBD growth screens still outnumber healthy ones by a wide margin. For growth investors, the stock market is sending a pretty clear message: Stay in cash and don't try to make money going long in a down-trending market. Wait for renewed signs of institutional buying.


Other software stocks in decent setups rallied early with the Nasdaq Wednesday, including **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)).


Okta and MongoDB aren't profitable yet but show big sales growth in recent quarters. It's no secret why enterprise software stocks are showing resilience in the current market: Fundamental outlooks for many remain bright.


Continue to monitor the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) for stocks holding up well. These could be your next stock market leaders.


When Will The Stock Market Bottom?
----------------------------------


The stock market is still in a correction, but it's important to watch for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), even though the last two by the Nasdaq didn't amount to much. A follow-through day on Nov. 7 was quickly met with selling. So was another one on Nov. 28. That both of them didn't work doesn't lessen their importance. Many do spawn nice uptrends, so it's important to know when one occurs. Rest assured, a follow-through day will come that will deliver plenty of base breakouts and moneymaking opportunities.


Another interesting headline Wednesday was the latest weekly reading from Investors Intelligence regarding bullish and bearish sentiment among newsletter writers. The bulls fell to 39.3%, down from 45.4% and 46.7% the prior two weeks. The 39.3% reading is the lowest since May 2016, just ahead of a big breakout for the Nasdaq composite.

But the Investors Intelligence survey is a secondary market indicator at best. It's a contrarian indicator that has worked well in the past. Extreme bearish sentiment has been seen at several market bottoms in the past.

Stocks added to their win streak Friday as the Nasdaq chalked up a fifth straight gain and the S&P 500 rose a third consecutive session.


The Nasdaq popped 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The IBD 50 fell 1%.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE.


Action on Friday showed some contradictions.


Despite the Nasdaq's sizable gain, losing issues led winners by a 7-5 ratio. On the NYSE, losers also held an advantage, though it was tiny.


How then did the Nasdaq turn in such a nice gain?


A handful of stocks with heavy weightings in the index scored big advances. **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) gapped up 14%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) leapt 10%. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) rumbled 5% higher. **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) Class C shares and **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) Class A shares each rose 3%.


Together, the five tickers account for more than 14% of the Nasdaq's weighting.


Ideally, bulls would like to see leadership broadening rather than narrowing, especially with the uptrend only recently losing the "under pressure" label.


Yet a trimming down of recent leaders seemed to be Friday's theme.


**Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) gapped down almost 7% as it sliced under its 50-day moving average line for the first time since Dec. 1. The big-cap company reported quarterly results that missed the Street's estimates.


Pessimism appeared to spread within the biotech group. Of 15 other stocks in the group with Composite Ratings of 90 or better, 13 fell.


Chips, another leading sector, also were hit hard. **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) might have set the negative tone late Wednesday when the company missed on the top and bottom lines, blaming weak demand and a strong dollar. The stock fell 7% Thursday and was flat Friday. Volume was heavy both days.


On Friday, **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) fell 4%, losing its 50-day line. **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) dropped 6%, also lancing its 50-day line. Other chip stocks cutting under the 50-day line or falling further under the line included **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)), down 3%, and **Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)), down 6%.


Whether the stocks were chipmakers or designers, the result was the same. Both industry groups fell close to 3%.


Apparel and retail stocks picked up some of Friday's slack. Many groups in those sectors also did well for the week.


How should individual investors handle this situation?


Investors should watch for further signs of market rotation. If rotation develops, then individual investors must go with the flow and get money out of the weakening sectors and into the new leadership. However, there's no guarantee that what happened Friday was the beginning of a shift.


And with the uptrend carrying a heavy load of distribution, investors should stay flexible.


Friday was a light day for U.S. economic data. The report on durable goods orders for March was mixed. New orders jumped 4%, trouncing views for a 0.5% gain. But orders ex transportation were expected to rise 0.3%. They actually fell 0.2%.


For the week, the Nasdaq advanced 3.2%, the S&P 500 1.8% and the IBD 50 1.4%.

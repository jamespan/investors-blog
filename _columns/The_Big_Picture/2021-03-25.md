The stock market reversed higher Thursday after rebounding from morning losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the major stock indexes higher, staging a bullish upside reversal.




The Nasdaq declined as much as 1.4% before moving up 0.1% by the close. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5%, while the Dow 30 rallied 0.6% after both erased earlier losses. The small-cap Russell 2000 rebounded 2.3%, recovering most of Wednesday's nearly 2.4% loss.


Leading growth stocks also reversed higher, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1.3% Thursday. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 16-ranked **MDC Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) rebounded from its 50-day moving average, gaining 3.3%. Homebuilders continue to be a source of strength amid the choppy stock market action.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq compared with Wednesday's figures and appeared to be higher on the NYSE.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP032521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP032521-241x300.jpg)On Wednesday, IBD's market outlook [was downgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-takes-another-hit-intel-news-lifts-chip-equipment-firms/) to an uptrend under pressure after a second straight distribution day, along with heavy selling in small-cap stocks.


That selling continued Thursday morning. But the major stock indexes were able to crawl out of the red and notch modest gains in afternoon trade.


While Thursday's reversal was encouraging, the market remains uncertain and requires more caution from investors. The Feb. 18 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq was deleted because 25 days have passed. Still, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have a hefty number of distribution days.


Amid the new stock market weakness, even previously strong stocks like **CF** **Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) are seeing selling pressure. On Thursday, CF Industries fell more than 8% below the 48.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), which is a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


While shares reversed from early losses, they remain under their key 50-day line.



During weak and choppy markets, one of the best ways to find the next cycle of stock market leaders is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If a stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles higher. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, the line will point lower.


Look for stocks that are holding steady — or even rising — amid the recent weakness in the major indexes. For now, the stock market's weakness is holding them back. But when that pressure is released, they should shoot higher. Ideally, these leaders should break out past proper buy points in heavy volume, indicating big institutional demand.

Four Chip Stocks Lead
---------------------


Chip stocks continue to be some of the best technology names amid the stock market weakness.


**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) hit a new high Wednesday before backing off 1.1% Thursday. The chip leader is an [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock.


**ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) continues to build the right side of a potential base. The minimum length of a cup base is six weeks, so a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) could emerge at the end of the week. ASML shares rose 0.9% Thursday.


**Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) gave up its 50-day line amid Wednesday's sell-off. Shares are closing in on a 191.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), while an early entry exists at 185.96. On Thursday, Qorvo stock moved up 0.3%.


Recent [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mks-stock-rebounds-after-chip-gear-maker-exits-battle-for-coherent/) **MKS Instruments** ([MKSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKSI)) briefly triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from a 177.46 buy point in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/). Shares reversed 0.3% higher Thursday.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [MKSI stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-m-k-s-instruments-inc-mksi.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).

Stocks To Watch: General Motors
-------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) found much-needed support at its 50-day line Thursday. Shares tumbled as much as 2.8% before reversing 1.4% higher by the close. If the market trend was in more positive shape, then the stock would be in a new buy area.


Per Leaderboard commentary, "GM is a cyclical play, and industrial companies have been market leaders. A chip shortage is hitting GM and other automakers."

Stock Market Is Calm, But Small Caps Stumble
=============================================

Small caps took the hardest hits Thursday in a session that was otherwise calm. Volume slowed and price action was small.




The Nasdaq eased less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1%. Blue chips, as gauged in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were just above flat. The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.5%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges vs. the previous session.


Stocks falling in the small-cap S&P 600 included chip designer **Semtech** ([SMTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMTC)), down about 6% in heavy volume; building products chain **Lumber Liquidators** ([LL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LL)), off about 6% in busy trade; apparel chain **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)), off about 6% in fast turnover; upscale home furnishings provider **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, down 3.5% in brisk volume; and women's apparel retailer **Chico's FAS** ([CHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHS)), off 3% in light action. Chico's is a low-priced stock that has been declining for more than two years.


Apple Up
--------


In the blue chip Dow Jones, winners and losers were about evenly split for the day. **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) climbed 1.2% in below average volume as it marked a new high. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) advanced 0.9% in below-average trade.Â **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rose 1.1% in slow turnover.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP03141919-256x300.jpg)After diving almost 40% from early October to early January, Apple has rallied 29%. Apple retook its 50-day line Jan. 30 but is about 4% under its 200-day moving average.


Going into Thursday's session, Apple sported a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 73. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A reading of 73 means Apple is trailing about 27% of all stocks in IBD's database.


Cautious Leaders
----------------


Cautious stock plays accompanied the quiet session. A third of the day's upside leadership consisted of defensive stocks such as tobacco, food, medical care and hospitals. The software sector, a market leader, contributed some aggressive ingredients.


On the downside, steel, retail and gold miners retreated sharply.


Economic News
-------------


News was mixed but was more like a series of jabs that lacked knockout power.


New home sales in January came in at 607,000, missing the consensus target for 612,000.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 229,000, a bit worse than the 225,000 expected.


Brexit continued to find no resolution. United Kingdom lawmakers voted to delay the Brexit process. Brexit would take Britain out of the European Union.


U.S. trade talks with China were pushed back to April, according to anonymous sources quoted in Bloomberg News.


Over the past few months, the China issue has influenced the stock market. But on Thursday, the Street apparently decided it had heard enough rumors.


Positive Signs
--------------


Although the market made little headway Thursday, the indexes quiet shrugs on China and Brexit were positive signs. A weaker market might have sold off on the China news or the fears surrounding Brexit. Growth leaders performed well in general Thursday amid a dull market, which was another positive sign. The IBD 50 rose 0.3%.


After hours, **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) reported that quarterly earnings rose 31% vs. the year ago, which was about 1% better than the Street expected. Revenue was slightly above estimates. In extended trade, Ulta jumped 3.5%.


Exchange Traded Funds
---------------------


Brazil's iShares MSCI Brazil ETF ([EWZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWZ)) faded 1.2% after four consecutive sessions of gains. The ETF, which pays a 2.5% dividend, is up 40% over the past six months. Brazil [markets have reacted positively to Jair Bolsonaro](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etf-leaders/brazilian-etfs-politics-bolsonaro/), their new president who is friendly to business.


The ETF has formed a giant cup with handle with a possible entry at 45.82. The stock closed Thursday at 43.21.

If the stock market needed a Band-Aid Monday to stop the bleeding, it needed a full blown tourniquet Tuesday.


The Dow took the biggest hit, falling 1.4%, while the S&P 500 gave back 1.1%, hurt largely by weakness in commodity stocks. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%. The declines were the worst for major stock indexes since the start of the year.




 It wasn't one particular headline that drove the selling; just a continuation of Monday's weakness that resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, and preliminary data showed higher NYSE volume. Higher volume meant distribution for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 Tuesday.


Distribution days are a sign of institutional selling, but keep in mind that the Nasdaq closed Tuesday only 1% off its high. It would need to pull back another 5% just to test the 50-day moving average. A break below this key support level in heavy volume would be cause for concern.


While two straight distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 give pause and raise the risk level a bit, the market remains in a confirmed uptrend. New buys should be handled with extreme care, while current holdings should be monitored for profit-taking opportunities. If there are no [sell signals](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/), there's no reason to panic


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MP013018-204x300.png)The Dow was hurt by weakness in **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)), **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)). Pfizer's earnings disappointed, fueling a 3% loss for the stock. McDonald's fell 3%, also on earnings. UnitedHealth Group gave back 4% on news that **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) are collaborating on a way to offer health care to U.S. employees with more transparency and at a lower cost.


Providers of pharmacy benefit management services fell hard on the news. **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)) closed off session lows but still fell 3% after touching the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/). **CVS Health** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) slumped 4%.


Bulls can take comfort in the fact that while some leaders are flashing sell signals, they seem to be the exception not the rule.


**PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) ended near its session high but still lost 2% after giving up its 50-day moving average in heavy volume Monday. Last week, **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) flashed a sell signal with a gap below the 50-day line on earnings. Exchange-traded fund IShares U.S. Home Construction ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) lost ground for the sixth straight session and closed below the 50-day line for the first time since September.


Meanwhile, plenty of other leaders are holding just fine, including **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), which report Wednesday after the close. Results from **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) are due Thursday before the open.  **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), Amazon and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) report Thursday after the close.


Meanwhile, the two-day Fed meeting got underway Tuesday, and a policy announcement is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The market is not expecting an interest rate hike this time around, but the chances for one at the March meeting are pretty good. According to [CME Group FedWatch](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/), the market sees a 72% chance for a quarter-point hike to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% in March.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) gapped down and fell nearly 4% to 72.72 after Barclays downgraded shares to equal weight from overweight with a 56 price target. Shares are now below the 74.90 buy point of a flat-base breakout Friday. Earnings are due Feb. 8 before the open.


IBD 50 names had a rough go of it Tuesday with 16 stocks down 2% or more. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 2% though it pared losses after a test of the 50-day line.

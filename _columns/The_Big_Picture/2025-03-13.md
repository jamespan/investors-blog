The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 537 points Thursday, as investors battled with the threat of more tariffs from President Donald Trump. Reeling from the losses, the S&P 500 closed in correction territory.


Blue chips on the Dow 30 lost 1.3%, extending a losing streak to four sessions. The S&P 500 sold off 1.4%, falling 10% from its record high in February. That's the technical definition of a correction.




The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2%, about 14% off its record high. And the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 1.6%, approaching bear market territory, as that index is down nearly 19% from its high.


Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors declined, with communication services and consumer discretionary pacing the losers. The utilities sector was the only gainer on the session, while materials held only a slight decline.


President Trump threatened new tariffs on the European Union Thursday morning. Trump warned in a [Truth Social post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114155003492555395) that the U.S. will place a 200% tariff on all wines, Champagnes and alcoholics products coming out of the EU unless it removes a 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


Inside the Dow Jones 30, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) sold off 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively. Those two stocks accounted for about 186 points, or one third of the Dow's 537-point loss.


On the Dow's upside, **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) were among the top performers Thursday, with gains of 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively.


In the Nasdaq 100, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) plummeted 13.9% while **Grail** ([GRAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRAL)) plunged 12.7%, making them the worst stocks of the day. [Adobe reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adobe-stock-adbe-fiscal-q1-2025-earnings/) late Wednesday. Meanwhile, **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) jumped 14.6% [after the company announced](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-new-ceo-rough-road-ahead/) that its board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as chief executive after a three-month search following the sudden retirement of previous CEO Pat Gelsinger.


All of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower, as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund lost 2.7%. Notably, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) tumbled another 3.4%, its fourth straight sell-off.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF declined 2.1%, more than giving up the entirety of Wednesday's rebound. Investor's Business Daily's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of big losers on the session, including **DoorDash** ([DASH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DASH)), which sold off 5%.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MP031325.jpg)


Amid heavy selling in recent sessions, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are trading below their long-term 200-day moving averages. And IBD's recommended exposure level stays at 0%-20%. That's a sure sign that caution continues to be the prudent choice, which is a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


Investors should wait for the rally attempt to confirm itself with a follow-through day, which could happen as soon as Monday, provided the Nasdaq doesn't take out Tuesday's intraday low. Thursday's lows came just shy of setting a new low.


Meanwhile, a potential follow-through day on the S&P 500 is not yet a possibility with the index hitting a new low Thursday. That index will need a Day One of a rally attempt first.


Instead, [investors should be creating new watchlists](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) with stocks that are holding up the best in the current stock market correction. These could be some of the next uptrend's market leaders. However, many previous leaders are in the very early stages of forming new bases, so it will take time for new leadership to crystallize.


An easy way to identify market leader is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/)to gauge an individual stock's relative performance. A rising relative strength line shows a stock is outperforming the S&P 500, while a downtrending line shows the reverse.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured zero new stocks Thursday, which makes sense given the pervasive market weakness. And the Near Pivot list has 11 ideas, a sign that few are poised for a potential move higher. Look for that number to increase in the coming weeks if the market rally attempt is able to confirm a new uptrend.

Stocks Market Leaders To Watch: Aon, Ryan, Vertex
-------------------------------------------------


Now is not the time to be raising exposure in growth stocks. Doing so would be fighting the current stock market trend. Instead, keep an eye on market leaders holding up relatively well, including **Aon** ([AON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AON)), **Ryan Specialty** ([RYAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAN)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)).



[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Aon is pulling back to a 395.33 buy point in a cup base following a recent breakout move. Its RS line hit a new high this week.


Ryan Specialty is building a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) that boasts a 71.33 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a cup with handle, according to [IBD MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). Shares are about 4% away from their new entry, while the RS line is nearing a new high.



Finally, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is approaching a 519.88 buy point after moving up a handle entry at 491.81 in recent weeks. The RS line is at its highest level since August.

Stocks Regain Some Confidence, But Obstacles Remain
====================================================

Stocks rolled ahead at the open Thursday and stayed on track throughout the session.

  

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 1% each, while the small cap S&P 600 popped 1.4%.

  

The IBD 50 led with a 1.5% gain.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The indexes swung back to positive ground for the year. January dug 2% and 3% holes for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 respectively, but the weak start might not mean much.

  

The negative side of the January barometer (a down January portends a down year) hasn't worked in recent years.

  

Red Januaries were recorded in 2014, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2005 and 2003, and only 2008 lost additional ground over the next 11 months.

  

Gains in the 11-month period for the Nasdaq were 15%, 24%, 54%, 7% and 52% for the relevant years from 2014 to 2003. An investor doesn't want to miss those kind of runs.

  

Market watchers Thursday suggested that investors regained some confidence on perceptions surrounding Greece and oil prices. West Texas intermediate crude oil climbed over $50, leading to speculation that oil prices might be settling. Concerns on Greece eased as conviction grew that the friction is more about negotiations than a standoff.

  

The major indexes rose further above their 50-day moving average lines Thursday, but a more significant obstacle remains. The indexes have traded inside a roughly 5% range since early December. The consolidation looks like a [Nicolas Darvas box](http://news.investors.com/management-leaders-in-success/010511-558846-nicolas-darvas-was-in-step-with-the-stock-market.htm?ntt=Darvas&p=full). The bulls would like to see the indexes leap out of that box.

  

In recent months, breakouts haven't made much progress, apparently stymied by the rangebound market.

  

On Thursday, more stocks broke out.

  

Breakouts included auto-parts store chain **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)); generic-drug manufacturers **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) and **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)); payment processor **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)); hand and power tool and equipment provider **Snap-on** ([SNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNA)); chipmaker **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)); data analytics software developer **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)); cloud security firm **Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)); October initial public offering **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)) ; and **Sally Beauty** ([SBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBH)).

  

So far, breakouts haven't delivered much in this pressured uptrend. In general, strong gains after the breakouts are missing.

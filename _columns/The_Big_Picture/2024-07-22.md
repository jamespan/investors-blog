  Stocks Rebound Broadly As This Signal May Mark A Low For Indexes

For the second straight week, the stock market faced a weekend of political upheaval, and for the second straight time, the market responded with Monday gains.




The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rebounded sharply and gave investors hopes that last week's selling may be done. The S&P — which climbed 1.1% — has held at its 5,500 level and regained the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The Nasdaq rose 1.6% and closed a hair above 18,000. The Magnificent Seven did their share, rising more than 2% as a group.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average held above the 40,000 mark after rising 0.3% Monday. Small caps rebounded as well, with the Russell 2000 recouping 1.7%.


Surely, some of Monday's rebound was a natural reflex to the indexes' tumble last week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq just went through their worst weeks since mid-April, and the Nasdaq snapped a six-week win streak.


Meanwhile, the IBD 50 index recovered 1.5%.


Unlike the sector rotation and "Trump trade" that defined much of last week's stock market, Monday's trading was broad and inclusive. Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was the only S&P 500 sector index down on the day. Still, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) outperformed with a 1.6% gain vs. a 0.5% increase for iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)).


The PHLX Semiconductor Index, whose 8.8% rout last week exemplified the tech sector's struggles, rose 4% and found support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


Advancing stocks topped decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by about 11-to-5 on the Nasdaq. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


Market Monitors Political Events
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP072224.jpg)On Sunday, President Joe Biden dropped out of the race for reelection and offered his support to Vice President Kamala Harris. While Biden's exit removes some uncertainties for the stock market, some big questions remain.


"In the near term, we should expect some market volatility as investors digest the news," Solita Marcelli , UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Americas, said in a note. "We have seen some rotation toward 'red' sectors and away from 'blue' ones in recent weeks as recent momentum has favored the Republican Party. That could at least partially reverse in the coming days as markets parse the latest developments."


But Marcelli cautioned that U.S. political outcomes are far from the largest driver of financial market returns or sector performance. Moreover, Harris or any Democratic nominee is not expected to deviate much from Biden's agenda on climate change, anti-competitive practices and other issues.


"In addition, much can still change ahead of November's ballot and a range of outcomes remain possible," Marcelli said.


The bond market was quiet after Biden's withdrawal. The 10-year Treasury yield rose two basis points to 4.26% for a third-straight increase.


Stock Market Bottoming Signal?
------------------------------


Political turmoil and a three-day stock market tumble last week shook the so-called fear gauge. Last week's 32.6% gain in the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) was its largest one-week gain since March 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data.



On Friday the VIX, as it's better known, jumped more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. Such sudden spikes often act as bottoming signals. Prior to Friday, the last time the signal flashed was April 12, which lagged the S&P 500's bottom by five sessions.


While helpful, the VIX signals should still be secondary to the price and volume action of the major indexes.


Until the stock market offers more signals, IBD is keeping its recommended exposure at 60%-80%. The downdraft in many leading tech stocks forced many investors to lighten their portfolios with those holdings. Financials and some homebuilders have provided fresh buy opportunities, although they are not in the same caliber as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) or **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).


Monday's breakouts were mainly small caps. **Armstrong World Industries** ([AWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AWI)) rose past a 125.56 saucer base buy point. **Clearwater Paper** ([CLW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLW)) and **Donnelley Financial Solutions** ([DFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DFIN)) also topped buy points. Cloud and data center services provider **ePlus** ([PLUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLUS)) broke out of a flat base.


**STAG Industrial** ([STAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STAG)), which owns warehouses and other industrial buildings, jumped past a 39.61 entry. The real estate investment trust might be deemed a midcap due to a $7.36 billion market cap.

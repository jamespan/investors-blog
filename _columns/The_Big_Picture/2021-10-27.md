  Nasdaq's Gains Dissolve Despite FAANG Stock Strength As This Sector Gets Slammed

The Nasdaq composite stepped on a proverbial "banana peel" for a second straight session Wednesday as early gains slipped. But small caps appeared to be the sector that really took a licking.




The Nasdaq's intraday gain of 0.8% did not match the prior session's early advance of 1%. But the two sessions pretty much mirrored each other in terms of how they finished. Wednesday's closing-time gain of 12-hundredths of a point, sharply less than 0.1%, is not exactly what stock market bulls would call appetizing.


Meanwhile, a 1.9% drop by the Russell 2000 looks quite odd when compared with the S&P 500's 0.5% decline. Midcap stocks also got pounded. The SPDR Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) slid almost 1.6%.


The midcap ETF now faces a new test of support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102721-185x300.jpg)Nasdaq volume fell, but keep in mind that Tuesday's turnover appeared to get skewed by hyperactive trading in cheap stocks. On the NYSE, Wednesday's volume jumped nearly 12%. Thus, the S&P 500 [logged its first distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), or instance of severe professional selling, since a new confirmed uptrend took hold with the Nasdaq's Oct. 14 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-look-a-lot-alike-how-to-identify-one/).


Defensive stocks did not outperform Wednesday. The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) exchange traded fund sank nearly 0.7%.


Transportation issues took a well-needed breather. The iShares U.S. Transportation ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) fell 1.4%. The fund had rallied in eight of the prior nine sessions.


As you can see in the Market Pulse, the count of distribution days is light. That's favorable for the nascent rally.


What's troubling is that at least a handful of growth stocks seemed to hit a trapdoor after attempting new breakouts.


From Forward Gear To Reverse
----------------------------


Just look at what **ZipRecruiter** ([ZIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIP)), a focal point of Wednesday's IBD Live show, did on Wednesday.


During the first 45 minutes of trading, the staffing play zipped to the 30 price level for the first time in nearly 11 weeks. [MarketSmith's pattern-recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) algorithm highlighted a 10-week cup with handle in the works before Wednesday's breakout move. The buy point is 29.31, a dime above the handle's highest price.


But pretty much the rest of the day, ZipRecruiter's chart action resembled a boulder rolling down a steep hill.



**Group 1 Automotive** ([GPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPI)), fellow car dealership chain **Asbury Automotive** ([ABG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABG)), **TechTarget** ([TTGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTGT)) and **Cadence Design** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) also plotted bearish post-breakout action on their respective charts. On the bullish side, solar plays gained more of their mojo seen in 2020.


The fact that it took one day for ZIP stock to go from breakout to bust — and [trigger the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) — tells us a few things.


One, right now, a savvy [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) trader should be ultra-picky about stocks as they form their bases. ZIP was hardly a model for an [excellent cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). It took just five sessions for the stock to etch the left side of its cup portion. That's too fast. As a result, [the pattern lacked symmetry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-stock-charts-roku-bullish-element-symmetry/).


Two, companies with a sketchy record of profitability tend to hold more risk.


In the second quarter, ZipRecruiter's sales rose magnificently, up 109%. So, why did it post a net loss of 55 cents a share? And why, in general, have annual results been so mixed in the bottom line of the income statement? When you decide to deploy a lot of your hard-earned capital into a single name, it often pays to really know [the fundamental story first](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


ZipRecruiter is slated to report its third-quarter results on Nov. 10.


Beyond Nasdaq: It's Still The Economy
-------------------------------------


Some market veterans worry that the stock market may get ahead of itself if the economy slows down materially. Andrew Slimmon of Morgan Stanley Investment Management wrote in a note sent to IBD that a bull case for Q4 would be wrong if institutions suddenly went on a buying spree of long-dated Treasuries.


Slimmon expects high-beta stocks to outperform, cyclical issues to beat defensive names, and industrial metals to do better than precious metals, Yet, "we will be wrong if the next move in U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields is from 1.57% to 1.25%, implying the economy is weakening rather than strengthening," he added.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond plunged 9 basis points to 1.53%. That's the biggest single-day drop since July 19, Cboe data shows.


Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research commented that investors should not ignore the impact from a sudden switch from a "Just In Time" (JIT) inventory management strategy, pioneered by **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), to a "Just In Case" (JIC) method that leads to hoarding of parts and raw materials. Amid all of the heavy moves by governments and central banks to stimulate investment and spending, the supply-chain side of the economy has gotten choked unusually tight.


Meanwhile, veteran portfolio manager Louis Navellier highlighted in his company's survey of investors that a majority believe "inflation will be a significant headwind for the markets by year-end."


"This is a notable difference from our survey in August, where 24% of investors thought inflation was 'transitory,' " Navellier wrote.

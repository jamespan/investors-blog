====================================================================

The major stock indexes scored more new highs Wednesday as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 extended their winning streaks to seven sessions.


The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.5% each. Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE rose slightly from Tuesday's levels.


The Russell 2000 finally cleared the 1,400 mark, rising 0.5%, after rising above some key resistance levels last week. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) outperformed, rising 0.7%.


![mp021517](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP021517-185x300.png)Breadth left something to be desired, with advancers only having a small advantage over decliners on both main exchanges. The ratio on the NYSE was 8 to 7. For the Nasdaq, it was 3 to 2.


The bulls are in the driver's seat for now, consumer confidence is high and market sentiment remains positive, but keep in mind that the Nasdaq is near an upper channel line, found by connecting the index's recent highs. A development like this means the index could be ready for a near-term pullback.


Longtime leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) in late December showed somewhat similar action, although its channel line spans a longer period and the stock flashed other signs of a climax top. Sellers took down the stock in January and a breakout attempt on Feb. 7 fizzled.


In economic news, the latest reading on consumer prices came in hotter than expected, basically mirroring a jump in wholesale prices Tuesday.


The data probably didn't do much to sway the Fed's inflation expectations, although consistent signs of inflation could force the Fed's hand to be more aggressive with rate hikes. For now, Fed chief Janet Yellen has been consistent in her calls for a gradual increase in interest rates.


[January retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-in-u-s-climb-more-than-forecast-in-broad-advance/) also came in better than expected, while December sales were revised higher. Economists attributed the strong showing to consistent job growth, wage increases and heavy discounting by retailers.


The market remains in a confirmed uptrend with a lot of good setups for individual investors to continue. But if you've been paying attention in recent weeks, good setups have resulted in a mixed bag of performance.


In the IBD 50 for example, **Sterling Bancorp** ([STL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STL)) cleared a 24.75 buy point Jan. 25, then fell 7% below the buy point. It reclaimed the 50-day moving average last week and cleared the buy point Wednesday as financials performed well again.


IBD 50 and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) has emerged as a breakout candidate. Shares rose 0.9% to 57.80 Wednesday. It's just below a 58.35 flat-base entry.


**Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)), another financial in the IBD 50, is still in buy range after Tuesday's breakout from a flat base with a 71.30 buy point.


Airlines outperformed on news that Warren Buffett and other high-profile investors have been nibbling in the sector. **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) and **Southwest** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) are the leaders in the group, but **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) is a breakout candidate as it works on a flat base with a 76.90 buy point. Shares rose nearly 3% to 75.75.


Breakouts were hard to come by, but new issue **Camping World** ([CWH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CWH)) made the cut even though it closed below a 34.39 buy point. Shares rose 3.5% to 34.35. Volume was barely above average. Goldman Sachs brought the retailer public in October at 22 a share.

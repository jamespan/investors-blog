  Big Picture: Technical Warnings, Stock Losses Unnerve The Bulls

U.S. stock indexes suffered fresh dents Friday, as the bulls failed to find an optimistic angle.




The Nasdaq slid 1.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 sank 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Small caps lost 1.1% in the S&P 600 gauge.


Volume was down on the Nasdaq. Preliminary data showed lower NYSE volume. The declining volume suggested funds weren't fully participating in the selling. The Aug. 30 [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) dropped out because it is now too old to count.


For bulls, fading volume eased the pain but did little else.

—New lows have outnumbered new highs in nine of the past 10 sessions. IBD's adjusted tally omits stocks priced under 10 or below a 60 EPS rating, which eliminates junk stocks.


The shrinkage in new highs pointed to a narrowing of market leadership.


—The Nasdaq has lost its 50-day moving average, and the way it occurred was ugly. The Nasdaq stabbed straight down two days in a row. In the meantime, the S&P 500 has stayed above its 50-day line.


—Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bear gauge is flashing warnings. The percentage of advisors that are bullish is at 61.8% vs. only 18.60% for the bears. Similar readings of bullishness occurred when the stock market hit highs in January. A pullback in the stock indexes soon followed.


—The put/call volume ratio closed at 1.04 Thursday and 1.05 Friday, according to preliminary data. The readings aren't yet at the 1.15 level, which often pegs short-time bottoms. Until the gauge hits 1.15, it's even more important to be cautious.


Keep Risk Low
-------------


While buying stocks in this atmosphere is risky, the individual investor should look for either groups or individual stocks to put on a watch list.


Here's one group that might deserve some attention.


In the past six weeks, railway stocks have moved up from No. 71 to No. 18 among 197 groups.


Over those past six weeks, the Nasdaq fell 4%, while the railway group rose 4%.


A broader gauge makes the point better. Beginning with the April 10 follow-through day, the Market Pulse has had bouts with pressure but has never tipped into correction.


Since April 10, the Nasdaq has risen 12% vs. 26% for the rail group.


Railroads: An Investment To Ride?
---------------------------------


Three factors could be helping the railroads.


First, higher gasoline prices hurt trucks more than they do railroads.


Second, the U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada could benefit railroads.


Third, and probably most important, the improving U.S. economy should reward railroads as a key participant in the economy.


Another factor in play for the overall stock market is yields. The 10-year yield settled at 3.23% Friday vs. 2.88% for the two-year, according to Bloomberg News. The 35 point spread has eased fears of a flattening yield curve, although fast-rising yields also mean higher borrowing costs.

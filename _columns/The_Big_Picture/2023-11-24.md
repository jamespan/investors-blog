  Stock Market Gains For Fourth Straight Week; Fed Chair Powell, Inflation Data Loom

The stock market served up a fourth straight week of gains in the truncated Thanksgiving period. Now an appearance by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and more inflation data are on the horizon.




The Nasdaq composite was pretty steady, falling a modest 0.1% Friday. It remains well above its 50-day moving average and its short-term moving averages. The tech-heavy index turned in a weekly gain of 0.9% and is now up a phenomenal 37% for the year as it looks to end 2023 on a high note.


The S&P 500 held above its own [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) as it gained 0.1%. The benchmark index lifted 1% for the week and looks set to close in on late-July highs. It is no slouch year to date either, rising more than 19%.


Advancers outnumbered decliners by nearly 3-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by over 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq, a good sign. Nevertheless, canny investors will realize it is foolhardy to read too much into a shortened post-Thanksgiving session.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average nominally outperformed the other major indexes with a 0.3% Friday lift and sits comfortably clear its 50-day line. **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) outperformed here.

Growth stocks also had a good session, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 0.6%.


Powell To Cap Busy Fedspeak Week
--------------------------------


A deluge of Fedspeak and economic data is set to drop in the week following the Thanksgiving respite for the stock market.


Senior Federal Reserve officials are set to speak every day from Tuesday, with the head honcho himself set to appear on Friday. Powell will partake in a fireside chat at Spelman College in Atlanta.


He will be speaking a day after the release of the latest personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. Core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is the inflation measurement most preferred by the Fed.


The slower earnings period continues, with the likes of [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) among noteworthy firms reporting in the week ahead.

Stock Market Groups Faring Best
-------------------------------


The bulk of the [S&P 500 sectors closed higher on Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Health care and energy were the best performers, while technology and communication services lagged.



In industry group performance in the [stock market today,](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) dairy products producers, oil & gas drillers, coal producers and department stores outperformed. The household appliances group also stood out, aided by a 40% jump by **iRobot** ([IRBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRBT)) amid positive acquisition news.


In contrast, solar stocks, food wholesalers, office supply retailers, travel booking plays and steel producers all struggled.

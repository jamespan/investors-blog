The stock market bounced back from a bumpy Friday, erasing early losses and putting itself in position to beat resistance levels.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9%, as biotech, semiconductor and other technology industries heavily weighted in the composite led Wall Street. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% and closed above 3000 for the first time since Sept. 19.


Small caps shined, as they've been doing since the Russell 2000 made a low on Oct. 3. The small-cap benchmark added 1%. The Russell 2000's year to date gain of nearly 15% now matches that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and is narrowing the performance gap with the S&P 500, which is up nearly 20%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.2% increase, mainly because **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) gapped down to a loss of 3.8% on continued [concerns over the company's handling](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-weigh-on-earnings-boeing-stock/) of its 737 Max groundings and questions over the plane's flight control design. Max jets face a possible delay into next year before they are authorized to fly.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP102119-262x300.jpg)Volume fell and lacked the intensity of Friday's selling. Keep in mind that Friday's session got a boost from expiring monthly stock and index options. But other indicators were positive, including breadth. Advancing stocks led decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Monday marked the expiration of the Sept. 16 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500, leaving both indexes with seven higher-volume losses in the past five weeks. That's still too high, but upward momentum is on the market's side right now.


With Friday's fumble behind, the stock market could make a run for its September highs. The S&P 500 is just 15 points away from the Sept. 19 high at 3121. The Nasdaq needs about 80 points to catch the Sept. 12 high. Even then, both indexes have even higher to go to reach the record highs made in July.


Now that indexes are holding above their 50-day moving averages, the September highs loom as a major test of the market's upward trend.


Leaders And The Stock Market
----------------------------


To do that, the stock market will need top-rated stocks to cooperate. That's happening, to some extent. The IBD 50 added 0.8%, in line with the broad market.



**Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)), which is also in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), rose to a new high in triple its average volume. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is an [IBD 50 stock to watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) when it reports earnings Tuesday after the close. The fast-casual chain's shares are [approaching an 858 buy point](https://www.investors.com/research/chipotle-stock-nears-buy-point-before-earnings-report/).


While dozens of stocks topped buy points Monday, [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) were lackluster. Many sank back below [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), volume was limp, stocks were thinly traded or there was a combination of those faults. **Boot Barn** ([BOOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOOT)), for instance, cleared its 37.72 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but closed below it.


**Magnachip Semiconductor** ([MX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MX)) was the only impressive breakout. But the maker of technology for the Internet of Things, autos and mobile devices is thinly traded and has a weak [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 62.


The market also will need to get through third-quarter earnings season in good shape. So far, earnings sell-offs have been limited. But the overall picture is mixed.


S&P 500 Earnings Mixed So Far
-----------------------------


So far, 84% of S&P 500 companies have topped consensus earnings estimates. That's above the five-year average, according to a FactSet report Friday. On the whole, earnings are 2.6% above estimates, and that's running below the five-year average. Only 15% of S&P companies had reported by then.


In terms of sales, 64% of companies have topped quarterly views, and on aggregate they've beaten the estimate by a slim 1%. Both figures are above five-year trends, FactSet says. Combining reported results and estimates, the S&P 500 is still on track for a 4.7% drop in EPS and a 2.6% rise in revenue.


In another report, FactSet said Q3 net profit margin for the S&P 500 is tracking at 11.3%. That would mark the first time there have been three straight quarters of year-over-year declines in net profit margin since Q1 2009-Q3 2009, a recession period.


The stock market opened higher on positive news on the China-U.S. trade war last weekend, thanks to comments from the chief Chinese negotiator on trade talks.


Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said the "[two sides have made substantial progress](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/us-and-china-made-substantial-progress-at-trade-talks-vice-premier-liu-he.html) in many fields, laying an important foundation for the signing of a phased agreement," reports said.

Stocks put in a second straight gain Monday, extending a recovery effort from last week's losses.


Helped by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which won an upgrade from Barclays and a price-target hike at Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq climbed 0.6%. Gains in **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) also boosted the tech-heavy index.


The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and has already recouped more than half of last week's loss. The Dow Jones industrials added a 0.7%, thanks to **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). The small-cap Russell 2000 tacked on 0.5%. Small caps often outperform when the market is up, but they didn't Monday.


Stocks added to Friday's gains amid better-than-expected earnings from **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and a round of deal news.


Long-term care provider **Kindred Healthcare** ([KND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KND)) offered to buy a 14.9% stake in home and hospice care company **Gentiva Health Services** ([GTIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTIV)).


Irish drugmaker **Shire** ([SHPG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPG)) is warming up to a buyout offer by **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), which has pursued it for months. (See story on Page A1.)


**Whiting Petroleum** ([WLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLL)) agreed to buy **Kodiak Oil & Gas** ([KOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KOG)) to become the Bakken region's top oil producer.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE but still came in below average. Winners beat losers by a little less than 2 to 1 on both major exchanges.


Last week's additional distribution days, plus poor action in some leaders (**GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)), **KapStone Paper & Packaging** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) and a few others triggered sell signals), led to a downgrade of the market outlook. So the continued healing on Monday was a positive step.


Leading stocks outperformed in price, but many rallied in weak volume. Only about eight IBD 50 stocks rose in above-average trade. The IBD 50 rose 1%.


**BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), which staged a big comeback from a failed breakout, hit a new high in above-average trade. So did **Gentherm** ([THRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THRM)).


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) closed back above a 66.57 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. It found support at its 50-day line last week. But volume was below average and even lighter than when it initially cleared 66.57 on June 24.


**Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) was a rare leader down in volume. The stock closed below its 200-day moving average, which it had traded above for more than a year. Despite a lack of company headlines, turnover was more than twice its daily average.


While earnings season kicked off with **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) last week, a heavy flow of corporate reports will roll in this week. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) are among the big ones reporting Tuesday.


While the earnings and sales figures are important, it's the reaction to the news that will tell you much about the stocks.

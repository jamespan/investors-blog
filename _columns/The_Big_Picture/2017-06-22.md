Stocks Erase Gains, But The Bulls Are Running In This Sector
=============================================================

U.S. stock indexes sauntered along in pedestrian volume Thursday, but biotechs and medical issues sprinted ahead in brisk trade.


Small caps posted the biggest gain among indexes, up 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq pocketed less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each lost less than 0.1%. A modest market rally faded in the final hour.


Volume fell across the board.


The May 17 distribution days fell off the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 because of time. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.


Despite the indexes' lack of big action Thursday, there were plenty of winners. It's a cliche on Wall Street to say there's always a bull market somewhere. On Thursday, that somewhere included the biotech and drugmaker spaces.



The biotech group surged 1.25%, easily topping the major indexes, according to preliminary data. Over the past five sessions, the biotech group gained 9.3%. Drugmakers popped 1.7% Thursday, but that group has gained only about 5% in the past five sessions.


Market chatter attributed medical sector strength to a New York Times report Tuesday that said President Trump was about to sign an executive order easing regulations on drug stocks.


The Republican Senate's plan on health care also might have had some effect, though the bill appeared headed toward defeat in the U.S. Senate. Four Republicans – including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas — came out again the bill that Paul called "ObamaCare lite." The bill could lose two Republican votes and still pass, but two is the limit.


The Republican bill would double contribution limits for health savings accounts. Yet **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)), a provider of health savings accounts, lost ground Thursday, perhaps reflecting the bill's insufficient support.



For biotechs, the bullish action began before the news items emerged. The biotech stock group put in a short-term low at the end of May and then began rising. The group rose 17% from that May low before pulling back about 1%.


Is there anything left to buy in the biotech space?


Among the 10 biotech stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or better, several could offer entries — either by coming back to the 5% buy zone or by clearing a buy point.


**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) is just within the 5% buy zone that reaches to 134.13.


**Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)) is just within a 5% buy zone capped at 12.26.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MP_4x2_062217.png)Bioverativ** ([BIVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIVV)) is within a 5% buy zone that stretches to 61.93. The stock is a February initial public offering.


**Ionis Pharmaceuticals** ([IONS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IONS)) is climbing the right side of a rough consolidation. A buy point could emerge at 57.10, which is 4% above the current price.


**Exelixis** ([EXEL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXEL)) is approaching a 24.95 buy point in a cup pattern.


Another possibility is to look for an opportunity to buy one of the biotech exchange-traded funds. They offer some safety in numbers but also some exposure to more speculative biotechs. Some biotechs are rising despite never having turned a profit.


For example, **Bluebird Bio** ([BLUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLUE)) has lost money in each of the past six years but is up 57% so far this month. The speculative stock has a small place in the iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) ETF and in the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) ETF.


Thursday's Economic News

Stocks could've easily found excuses to go down Friday, but the indexes kept their cool. The Nasdaq added 0.6%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The IBD 50 jumped 1%. Volume fell on both major exchanges, which is normal on the day before a three-day holiday. The market is closed Monday for Memorial Day.


If the market were looking for excuses to sell-off Friday, the disappointing news was there.


The second take on Q1 GDP was revised from 0.5% to 0.8%, shy of the 0.9% consensus estimate. Bulls were hoping for a much better number. Also, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey came in below views. The Street expected 95.5 but got 94.7.


International news also was negative. Fortune reported Friday that China's industrial profits slowed in April.

Bloomberg News reported that Brazil's interim president Michel Temer's reforms were stalled in Congress after his budget minister stepped down on corruption accusations. Goldman Sachs had been describing Temer's allies as a "dream team" for turning Brazil's economy around.


Yet despite all the bad news, U.S. stocks advanced. Investors should be growing more aggressive with their exposure to stocks. But the main indexes are approaching their April highs, where a pullback is possible. Those prior highs, therefore, are an important level to watch in the coming week.


For the week, the IBD 50 rose 4%; the Nasdaq, 3.4%; and the S&P 500, 2.3%.


Stocks also showed technical improvement. The Nasdaq shed three distribution days during the week, while the S&P 500 dropped one. All the deletions were due to time.


**Coming up**: With the market behaving better, investors should be looking for stocks that might soon break out. So let's look at stocks that fit these parameters: A Composite Rating of 90 or better; daily dollar volume of at least $20 million; a top-third industry group rank; and within 5% of a 52-week high.


If a stock is 1% to 5% from an entry, a breakout could occur soon.

Bears put a vicious end to the Nasdaq's five-day win streak, even as the stock market indexes stayed stubbornly above their Christmas Eve closing lows.




The Nasdaq skidded 3% Thursday, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 lost 2.8% and 2.5%. Small caps lost the least as the Russell 2000 dropped 1.8%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges vs. the previous session, according to preliminary data.

Stock Market Indexes: Why The News Is Getting Stale
---------------------------------------------------


If the bears are to find another downward leg to this correction, they probably will have to depend on algorithm trading more than the news.


Old bad news has lingered, delivering the same repetitive message almost daily. The enduring topics are China and tariffs, the Federal Reserve and interest rates, and the government shutdown.


Given the repetitiveness, much of the old bad news is probably baked into the indexes.


Where does that leave the bears?


Two Takes On The ISM Survey
---------------------------


Pessimists tried to find a new angle on gloom Thursday in the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report. The drop from 59.3 in November to 54.1 in December was the biggest drop since October 2008.


But investors have to be blind to math and context to make that fact work.


In October 2008, the manufacturing gauge *contracted* for a third consecutive month. A reading above the neutral 50 level means that factory activity is expanding. A number below 50 points to slowing. The current report remains on the *growth* side.


In what universe does contraction equal growth, albeit slower growth?


The current stock market is deep in that universe, which is another way of saying the bearishness is deep-seated. And it isn't just bears. Fearful ex-bulls are seeing gloom everywhere. Such a view has expanded sharply in the past two weeks, as evidenced by the latest readings of the [Investor Intelligence survey of market pundits](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) provided a nice surprise for the bears Thursday as it gapped down 10% on a weak outlook. But the Street had already been ratcheting down the earnings outlooks for Apple in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Apple's fiscal year ends in September.


Since at least late November, Apple was seen as [out of favor until late 2019](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-penalty-box-late-2019/). In early December, IBD reported that analysts were ["playing limbo" with Apple price targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-price-target-morgan-stanley/).


Unlike the stock market, Apple pierced its Dec. 24 closing low.


Can Fed Help The Stock Market Indexes?
--------------------------------------


On Friday, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will give a speech in Atlanta. Investors will be watching for signs that might help the stock market. The market appears to want fewer rate hikes.


Powell will speak at 10:15 a.m. ET.


The employment report for December will be released before the market's open. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to rise 180,000. The jobless rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.7%.

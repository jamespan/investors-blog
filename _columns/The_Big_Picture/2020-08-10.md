The stock market rallied broadly Monday — until you got to the Nasdaq composite.




The Nasdaq fell 0.4%, though it had been down as much as 1.5%. By comparison, the S&P 500 added 0.3% and marked a seventh consecutive gain.


Just last week investors were marveling at the Nasdaq's seven-day win streak. But the composite has already had its turn at the top. Today, it's the S&P 500 that's outperforming as the market rotates away from technology and into cyclicals.


Appropriately, it was the index with "industrial" in its name that led the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% as **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), **Raytheon Technologies** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)) and **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) climbed about 5% each. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) jumped past the 104.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), and for its efforts was rewarded with a spot on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) as a quarter-size position.


Small caps also performed well, as the Russell 2000 added 1%.


![MP081020](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP081020-220x300.jpg)The Nasdaq's underperformance was all the more notable because stock market breadth was bullish. Advancing stocks led decliners by better than 16-to-5 on the NYSE. Even the Nasdaq saw winners over losers by 3 to 2. Nasdaq volume fell, so the composite avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


Technology, some health care and media shares bore the brunt of the selling. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) fell 0.5%. This is part of a trend over the past few sessions.


Take the S&P 500's win streak. In the same time the S&P 500 has climbed 3.5%, the growth-focused IBD 50 has crawled up 1.4%. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) on Monday fell 0.9%.


Energy, air freight, airlines and a few retail groups were some of Monday's best performing industry groups. IBD's airlines group jumped nearly 5% on positive trends for the industry. CNBC reported that the number of passengers passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints at U.S. airports rose to the [highest level since March](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/airline-shares-surge-as-tsa-numbers-hit-pandemic-high-support-for-second-bailout-builds.html). Those numbers are still 70% below year-ago levels.


The iShares Trust Transportation Average ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) last week and marked its eighth gain in the past nine days.


Stock Market Hopeful On Vaccine
-------------------------------


The stock market seems hopeful that a coronavirus vaccine will hit the market in a matter of months. If so, an effective vaccine would have a global benefit. Its impact would be far more reaching than U.S.-China trade woes or the frustrated coronavirus stimulus package in Washington.


Ultimately, it is a good sign when economically sensitive stocks outperform. The coronavirus stock market has created its own winners, but the economy needs to put more people back to work.



The sector rotation's losers are many of the summer's winners. In the past five sessions, the worst performing industry groups are computer networking, chip-equipment and an assortment of software groups. You'd find many of the new bull market's leaders in these groups, including **BlackLine** ([BL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BL)), **Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)), **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) and **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)).


**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) are now below their 10-week moving averages, breaking their price uptrends.


But there could be new opportunities as many leading stocks try to find support at their 10-week lines. **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), **Simulations Plus** ([SLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLP)), **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) are some to watch.


Chinese stocks continued to fall after President Donald Trump last week announced a crackdown on TikTok and a social media app from **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)).

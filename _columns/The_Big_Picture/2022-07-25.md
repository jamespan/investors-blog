One of the most important weeks for the stock market started Monday with predictable apprehension that only grew with **Walmart**'s ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) dour outlook.




The major indexes wavered much of the session but trimmed losses with a rebound in the final hour. The Nasdaq composite cut its loss to 0.4% as technology, internet and consumer discretionary sectors underperformed.


The S&P 500 edged up 0.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%. Small caps outperformed: The Russell 2000 climbed 0.6%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 0.7% in a fine day for leading stocks. But the IBD 50 index and its tracking ETF have been nearly flat since their June lows, while indexes have been rising.


There's still an unsatisfying amount of growth stocks forming [sound bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) or making big moves above buy points. Just like it's hard to make apple pie without apples, investors are struggling to build exposure with a dearth of winning stocks.

Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq. The restrained trading suggests institutional investors are reluctant to make major moves before the Fed meeting and the major earnings reports.


Big Week Of Stock Market News
-----------------------------


Few weeks have as much headline importance as this one. Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will issue its latest policy statement.


Traders are [expecting another 75-basis-point increase](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) in the fed funds rate. But the stock market — and other financial markets — will want to know [where the Fed goes from here](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-recession-us-economy-sp-500/?refcode=-07252022-3-RL-1:07:2022:3Q:NewsLetter:Email:-07252022:na:na:na:na:25:12:3:RL:1&j=1719266&sfmc_sub=114864077&l=222_HTML&u=22902006&mid=100016628&jb=5).


The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 0.038 basis point to 2.819% Monday. The shorter-term two-year yield rose to 3.035%, an inversion in the yield curve that could signal a recession.


It's also a [busy week for earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), made all the more important because so many flagship companies are announcing quarterly results.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) will report. Those four companies alone represent nearly 20% of the S&P 500 index, which gives you an idea of how much is at stake.


And that doesn't include a number of bellwether companies such as **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)), **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)).


Earnings So Far Are Mixed
-------------------------


Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS, says that with about one-quarter of the S&P 500 companies already posted, second-quarter earnings season is off to a mixed start.


"But the results that have come in so far are better than many investors feared, and this has helped drive the recent rally in stocks," he wrote in a report Monday.



Earnings growth is slowing, but not sinking, he added. Some 60% of companies have beaten sales estimates, and 75% surpassed earnings estimates. Earnings are beating views by 2.5%. Third-quarter EPS estimates are running about 1% lower for companies that have reported. "So, we are seeing modest earnings cuts, but these are in line with historical patterns."


Late Monday, [Walmart cut its profit forecast](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2022/07/25/walmart-inc-provides-update-for-second-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2023) for the current quarter and full fiscal year, sending its shares down more than 8% in extended trading. The retailer now expects fiscal Q2 sales growth of 7.5% and 5.5% for the full year, excluding divestitures. It forecast a drop of 8% to 9% in Q2 earnings and a drop of 10% to 12% for the fiscal year.


"The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend, and while we've made good progress clearing hardline categories, apparel in Walmart U.S. is requiring more markdown dollars," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a news release. "We're now anticipating more pressure on general merchandise in the back half; however, we're encouraged by the start we're seeing on school supplies in Walmart U.S."


Stock Market Signals Are Mixed
------------------------------


With the stock market unsure of its next steps, the charts of the major indexes are mixed. [Distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) are thinning out, and a series of higher highs and higher lows continues to develop since the mid-June lows. Indexes are holding above their 50-day moving averages, and the shorter-term 21-day exponential moving averages are turning higher.


At the same time, the Nasdaq last week hit resistance around the 12,000 level and the S&P 500 at the 4,000 level. The Dow is facing a challenge at the 32,000 mark.

Technology stocks led market gains Thursday in a session that, unlike many prior ones, saw broad participation from multiple sectors.




The S&P 500 added 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%. Both made record highs, though they closed off session highs.


The Nasdaq composite led with a 2.5% vault. But the index is still about 5% below prior highs, as it climbs out of a deeper hole than the other major indexes. The Nasdaq closed above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since March 2.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That may not seem like much on a brilliant day for the stock market. But it did deprive the market of a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP031121-218x300.jpg)Still, IBD's market outlook moved back to "confirmed uptrend" Wednesday, ending a period of correction.


It was an unusual step because there was no technical [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). But it would have been foolish to ignore the S&P 500's rebound and the Dow's rise to record highs. Moreover, many top-rated stocks — [largely in cyclical, financial and consumer sectors](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-breakouts-latest-moves-find-three-key-trends/) — have been breaking out, and belie a market correction.


Technology stocks took the brunt of the February-to-early-March market sell-off.


Theoretically, a follow-through can still happen, and it would only solidify the confirmed uptrend.


Nasdaq volume on Thursday came in less than 1% lower than Wednesday's.


Distribution Day Drops
----------------------


The March 4 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq was erased after Thursday's gains exceeded 5% from that day's closing prices. Despite bullish action this week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still carrying five distribution days.


That's kind of a lot. But just like our market outlook improved without the customary signal, it's smart to study multiple indicators and make a well-rounded analysis. To wit, the tide of economically and rate-sensitive stocks asserting leadership more than offsets concerns about market distribution right now.


The shift in leadership can be seen in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), where **Regal Beloit** ([RBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBC)) and **ArcelorMitta**l ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)) joined on Thursday, and **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) saw a raise in position size.


Electrical equipment maker Regal Beloit and steelmaker ArcelorMittal broke out of [cup-without-handle bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in heavy trading.


Across the general market, breadth was strong. Advancing stocks led decliners by 11-to-3 on the Nasdaq and by 15-to-4 on the NYSE.


Technology Stocks Lead Market
-----------------------------


Nearly all S&P sectors rose, with technology stocks leading. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) jumped 2.1% and closed back above its 50-day line.


Communications Services Select Sector SPDR ([XLC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLC)), in which **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are the main components, rose to a record high. Both stocks are trying to snap out of trading ranges.


Energy, consumer staples and industrial sectors saw limp action, while Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) eased 0.3%. Government yields were little changed Thursday and have been coming down this week. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, surprised investors by signaling it will make even more aggressive purchases of debt securities through the 1.85 trillion euro pandemic emergency purchase program, or PEPP. According to Tradeweb, Germany's 30-year bond finished the day with a yield of 0.18%, down from a recent closing high of 0.24%.


This news helps explain why the market — especially technology stocks — are rebounding.


During the market slump, sector performance often varied sharply. Technology stocks were usually the losers, while new economy stocks emerged thanks to the re-opening of the U.S. economy and a new, massive stimulus package. President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion spending measure Thursday.


Small caps are rebounding this week as well. The Russell 2000 rallied 2.3% Thursday to a new high, rising past the Feb. 10 prior peak.


Compared to the Nasdaq, which is half weighted in tech stocks, less than 13% of the Russell 2000 is in technology companies. Its larger weightings are in health care (nearly 19%), industrials and financials (both about 16%) and nearly 16% in consumer discretionary.


That puts the small-cap benchmark in an advantageous position in the context of the sector rotation.

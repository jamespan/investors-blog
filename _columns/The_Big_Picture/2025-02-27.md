**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the market to substantial losses Thursday. Reeling from the sell-off, Wall Street braced for Friday's inflation report. A hotter-than-expected reading in personal consumption expenditures could place even further selling pressure on the major stock indexes.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%, while other indexes suffered much larger losses. The S&P 500 sold off 1.6% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index declined 1.6%.




Only three of the 11 S&P 500 sectors climbed, with financials and energy pacing the gainers. The technology and utilities sectors were the day's weakest performers.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. That resulted in a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, taking their respective totals to eight and seven.


Ahead of Thursday's open, [President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114076153524132682) that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect on March 4 and that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on that date. Meanwhile, reciprocal tariffs will go into effect on April 2.


Up next is the Commerce Department's personal income and outlays report for January, which includes the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's favored inflation indicator. Econoday sees that index rising 0.3% on the month, with an annual increase of 2.6%.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.28%, while West Texas Intermediate futures rose to around $70.10 per barrel.

Inside the Dow Jones 30, [Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-nvda-q4-earnings-report-q1-outlook/) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) sold off 8.5% and 4%, respectively. Both [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-salesforce-earnings-q42024/) late Wednesday. Those two stocks deducted about 144 points off the Dow, which declined 193 points Thursday.


On the Dow's upside, **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) were among the top performers Thursday, with gains of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively.


In the Nasdaq 100, **Warner Bros. Discovery** ([WBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBD)) (up 4.8%) and **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) (up 2.1%) were the best stocks of the day.


Meanwhile, **Grail** ([GRAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRAL)) and **MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)) crumbled 10.5% and 8.8%, respectively.


All of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower, as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) lost 3.2%. Notably, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) [skidded another 3%,](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-falling-support/) extending a losing streak to six sessions. Shares are more than 40% off their 52-week high and are testing their 200-day moving average.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund tumbled 2.1%, nearly giving up the entirety of Wednesday's rebound. Investor's Business Daily's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of big losers on the session, including **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)), which declined 5.4% to break the 50-day line.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP022725--210x300.jpg)


The Nasdaq tumbled below its January lows, falling further under its 50-day line, which it first broke on Feb. 21. The Nasdaq isn't too far from its 200-day line either, which is an important level to watch.


Due to the persistent weak action among top growth stocks, along with a high level of distribution days, IBD  reduced its recommended exposure level to 20%-40% from 40%-60%.


Investors should be cutting back exposure, starting with any holdings that have made sell signals. That's a key element of [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/). Many leaders in recent sessions have seen some sharp declines, giving back significant profits and triggering sell signals, such as a breaks of the 10-week moving average.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured zero new stocks, which makes sense given the recent weakness. And the Near Pivot list remains low at just four ideas, a sign that few are poised for a move higher.

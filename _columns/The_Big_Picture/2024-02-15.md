The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market higher Thursday, as investors braced for Friday's early release of January's producer price index.




Stock market leaders **Birkenstock** ([BIRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIRK)), **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) are at bullish points on their charts.


Economic Data, Earnings Report
------------------------------


Ahead of Thursday's stock market open, the Labor Department's initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell to 212,000. That gives no indication of a softening labor market. They were expected to rise to 219,000 vs. 218,000 in the previous week.


But consumer data softened, as [January's retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-jobless-claims-to-set-tone-for-sp-500-treasury-yields-after-hot-cpi/) tumbled 0.8% vs. December's better-than-expected 0.6% gain. Economists expected retail sales to fall 0.1% in January. Excluding autos, January sales fell 0.6%, and dropped 0.5% excluding autos and gas.


In response, the 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 4.24%, holding just off its highest level since early December.


Friday's premarket release of the producer price index also could have a big influence on the near-term path of the S&P 500 and interest rates. That's because some of the key inputs into the core PCE price index come from the PPI, most notably health care, which was one of the hottest parts of the consumer price index.


January's PPI is expected to rise 0.1% on the month, with an annual increase of 0.7%. Wall Street expects the core PPI to rise 0.1% on the month, with a 1.7% annual rise, per Econoday estimates.


![Market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP021524-213x300.jpg)Key earnings movers Thursday included **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **JFrog** ([FROG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FROG)), **Pegasystems** ([PEGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEGA)) and **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)).


Cisco shares declined 2.4%, while Crocs surged more than 12% to break out past a 110.90 buy point. JFrog shares soared 28%, extending further past a 35.35 flat-base entry.


Pegasystems shares jumped 35% to stage a breakaway gap past a 54 cup-base entry. And Shake Shack shares rallied 26%, closing 28% above a 76.74 entry.

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD is maintaining its recommended exposure level at 60%-80%. The overall outlook remains "confirmed uptrend."


After a two-day pullback to kick off this week, the Nasdaq has recovered most of those losses over the subsequent two sessions.


The indexes remain pretty far above their 50-day moving averages, which would be a logical support area if the market makes a deeper pullback. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 continues to carry a moderate number of distribution days, with five.


Still, there's nothing that should keep investors from looking for new breakouts or strong rebounds from key support levels. It's just that at this stage of the market uptrend, investors shouldn't be buying heavily.


[IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list showed four breakouts Thursday**,** including **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)). Shares broke out past a 111.79 flat-base entry.


The MarketSmith "Near Pivot" list shows a handful of stocks nearing buy points in bases. For example, **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) is approaching a 92.38 flat-base buy point.

Outside Dow Jones: Birkenstock, Celsius
---------------------------------------



Meanwhile, market leaders Birkenstock, Celsius, MercadoLibre and Toll Brothers are in or near buy zones.


Birkenstock is forging a choppy cup base with a 52.12 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). An early entry at 51.09 is also in play. That could transform into a proper handle.


Energy drink maker Celsius is testing resistance around 63 after finding support around its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Clearing that ceiling in heavy volume can offer investors a chance to pick up shares.


Investors might also view a 68.95 buy point in a second-stage [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) as another potential entry.


MercadoLibre is rebounding from support around its 10-week line and previous flat-base buy point at 1,660. That's a bullish sign for the latest breakout.


Homebuilder Toll Brothers is bouncing from its 50-day line and is approaching a flat base's 105.91 buy point.

The stock market finished the week with solid gains Friday in a mostly quiet trading session. The S&P 500 set a record high and extended its win streak to seven days, while the Nasdaq rebounded from Thursday's decline to set a record closing high.




The Nasdaq ended up 0.6%, in line with the other major stock indexes, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.9%. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, extending a win streak to seven sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded up 0.6%, or 161 points, aided by a 2.7% rise in shares of **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). Walmart shares are extended from their 132.09 buy point in a double-bottom base and from a pullback to the 10-week moving average, as the company continues its pursuit of TikTok.


Leading growth stocks outperformed a bit, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rallied 0.8%. Among IBD 50 stocks, **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) soared 12.6% on [strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/workday-earnings-workday-stock-wday-q2-2020/) and triggered the [eight-week hold rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-growth-stocks-lesson-microsoft-special-sell-rule/) after a 20% gain in just three days. The stock Wednesday broke out above a 200.10 buy point in a flat base. On the downside, top biotech stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) declined 1.6%. A new flat base is forming, but the stock is stuck below its 10-week line.


![MP082820](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP082820-273x300.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. Thursday's session. NYSE volume rose.


Nasdaq Hits Record Closing High
-------------------------------


The Nasdaq set a record closing high, while the S&P 500 hit an all-time high. Meanwhile, institutional selling remains light. The past week, the Nasdaq's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count fell from three to one, and the S&P 50's count dropped from two to one. On Thursday, the Nasdaq logged one distribution day, while the S&P 500 showed a stall day, a subtle form of distribution.


Despite the bullish price action, it would be natural for the major stock indexes to pull back. The Nasdaq is more than 9% above its 50-day moving average and at the top of an upper channel line.


With that in mind, it's important to interpret the daily action instead of trying to predict what will happen. Investors should maintain a bullish mindset. If downside materializes, investors should be quick to cut losses and trim positions.

Stock Market Rallies Late To Keep Bottoming Hopes Alive; Defense, Commodity Stocks Try To Lead
===============================================================================================

A stock market rebound tried to stay alive Monday as indexes closed mixed in another day of volatile action and geopolitical uncertainty.




The Nasdaq composite changed direction at least three times Monday, ultimately closing with a 0.4% gain. The S&P 500 spent most of the day in the red and lost 0.2%.


It's hard to tell what, if anything, is moving the market from hour to hour. War headlines certainly factor into stock moves, but it also seems that investors are struggling with multiple and unfamiliar risks.


After Thursday's positive reversals and Friday's gains, the stock market rallied in the final 90 minutes Monday, keeping alive the hopes for a bottom. The market is on track for a possible [rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) as early as this week. Market bottoms often happen when investors least expect it, so be ready with a [well-researched watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%. The Dow faces a test of resistance at the 34,000 level, which served as support for about six months until this year's correction.

Stock Market Down 2 Straight Months
-----------------------------------


The major indexes made it two straight losing months. The S&P 500 lost 3.1%, the Dow 3.5% and the Nasdaq 3.4%. It's the first time since September and October 2020 that indexes fell in back-to-back months. It was also the largest S&P and Nasdaq losses since February and March 2020.


The war in Ukraine [complicates the global economy on multiple fronts](https://www.investors.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-poses-big-economic-risks-fed-policy-oil-prices-cybersecurity/), as the West fights back with economic sanctions. Heightening the conflict, Russian President Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert over the weekend.


Even in a global crisis, opportunities can emerge. As highlighted by the [IBD Live panel](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) in recent shows, defense, steel and natural resources stocks are rising as sanctions hit Russia, one of the world's largest producers of oil and other commodities.


Countries in Europe and the U.S. say they are [sending weapons into Ukraine](https://www.investors.com/news/defense-stocks-ukraine-european-military-spending-rises/), and Germany announced it will boost defense spending. The SPDR S&P Aerospace and Defense ETF ([XAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XAR)) jumped 4.8% to extend a sharp three-day win streak.


**Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)) jumped past the 409.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) in heavy volume. The stock is extended from the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/). **Elbit Systems** ([ESLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESLT)) gapped up 15.5% as it cleared a flat base with a 182.95 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy volume. **Curtis-Wright** ([CW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CW)) rose past a 142.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/). **L3Harris** ([LHX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LHX)) jumped past a 246.18 entry.


Energy, Steel Lead Stock Market
-------------------------------


Oil stocks remain market leaders, with the [sector up nearly 8% so far this year](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-feb-25-2022/). Energy stocks dominate [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s list of new 52-week highs.


U.S. crude jumped 4.5% to $95.72 a barrel, the largest single-day increase since Dec. 6 and the highest price since Aug. 29, 2014, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


And it's not just oil that's going up. All manner of raw materials are rising as the Russia-Ukraine war disrupts Black Sea trade, says Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, an economist at BMO Capital Markets. Aluminum climbed to fresh records while nickel hit the highest price since 2011. Wheat climbed to a decade high as corn and soybeans also rallied.



There's also institutional buying in steel stocks. On Friday, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), [which rejoined Leaderboard on Friday](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) and **Reliance Steel** ([RS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RS)) topped buy points, and most remain in buy zones.


The Russia-Ukraine war is overshadowing corporate earnings, but it's [a big week for the retail sector](https://www.investors.com/news/target-stock-target-earnings-nordstrom-urban-outffiters-ross-stores/). **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) kicks it off with its holiday-quarter results Tuesday morning. **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) (a buyout target), **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) also report this week.

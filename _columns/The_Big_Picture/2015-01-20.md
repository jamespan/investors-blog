Stocks Reverse Higher But Direction Remains Unclear
====================================================

The stock market reversed higher Tuesday, defending its recent lows even while its direction remained uncertain.

  

The Nasdaq had been down as much as 0.7% but closed with a gain of 0.4% as chipmakers and biotechs were in favor.

  

The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.2% after it too erased a 0.7% loss. Volume eased on both Nasdaq and NYSE.

  

For now, at least, the indexes have survived a test of their recent lows. On the S&P 500, the 2000 level is roughly where buyers have been emerging; on the Nasdaq, the floor has been roughly at 4550.

  

For the third time in four sessions, the indexes closed near session highs. It's encouraging to see buyers hold the upper hand.

  

These readings on the market are small in scale, but they are valuable at a time when market direction is still in doubt.

  

The market remains under pressure until its intentions become clearer.

  

You can put the Russell 2000 index on the negative side of Tuesday's ledger. The largest and most widely watched index of small-cap stocks underperformed, closing with a drop of 0.5%. It was a significant and curious divergence suggesting that institutional investors weren't embracing risk in all facets of the market.

  

For small investors, the biggest problem is not distribution days (still a small number) or sell signals. Rather, it is the challenge to find leading stocks making successful breakouts.

  

Clear winners are hard to find, but one of them is **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)). The IBD 50 stock reclaimed a 137.03 flat-base buy point last week and is now extended 7% past that entry.

  

In fact, medical stocks had some of the best showings in the IBD 50 on Tuesday, accounting for many of the best price gains. The IBD 50 rose 1.2%.

  

Few sectors look appealing at the moment. Real estate investment trusts and utilities have displayed relative strength.

  

Those sectors have a defensive flavor that is typically appealing to Wall Street when everything else is choppy or falling.

  

But airlines were Tuesday's best-performing industry group, rallying about 4%. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) led the group after its fourth-quarter earnings and sales topped expectations.

  

Shares vaulted 7% as they found support at the 50-day moving average in heavy trading (see story [here](http://news.investors.com/business/012015-735258-delta-tops-bullish-on-lower-fuel-prices.htm)). The Dow Jones transport average jumped 1%.

  

The earnings calendar is full this week, and reports will no doubt influence sectors and the broad market.

  

After the close, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) soared as the streaming-video provider beat estimates of subscriber growth. But **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) fell in extended trading after its sales missed expectations and management gave a weak outlook.

  

Another important headline looms Thursday, when the European Central Bank is set to decide on a stimulus program. The major European indexes climbed Tuesday in expectation of the stimulus, similar to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing strategy.

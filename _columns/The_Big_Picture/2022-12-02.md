The stock market swooned after a hot jobs report Friday but bulls had reasons to cheer after a late fightback saw indexes pare early losses.




The S&P 500 ended Friday down just 0.1%, well off lows for the day. It turned in a solid weekly gain of 1.1%, holding above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), after retaking the key level earlier in the week. Overall price action was encouraging, suggesting additional upside into year's end.


The Nasdaq composite ended the day down 0.2% but wrapped up the week with a 2.1% gain. Still, the index has lost almost 28% for the year. The 200-day line remains its next challenge, situated nearly 5% above this level.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood out, posting a minor 0.1% gain. It continues to trade well above its major moving averages. Components **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) performed best here.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index was a standout, booking a 0.6% gain, while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.3%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Advancers held a slender edge on decliners on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


Jobs Report Runs Hot, Hits Indexes
----------------------------------


The November jobs report delivered an early gut punch to the stock market. Nonfarm payrolls rose 263,000 in November, well above views for 200,000. Average hourly earnings spiked 0.6%, doubling analyst expectations.


Leisure and hospitality, health care and government work booked the highest job increases, accounting for the vast bulk of the gains. Transportation, warehousing and retail were the only areas to shed jobs.


"This report doesn't mean the risks of the Fed raising rates to 6% are back on the table," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients. He also said the report "doesn't change the trend of the data for both labor market and with inflation."


The report wasn't enough to derail a good week overall for the stock market, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday that smaller interest rate hikes are likely ahead, helping to boost sentiment.  A smaller-than-expected rise in the core PCE inflation rate was also good news.


With the Santa Claus rally still in play, it looks like there is decent scope for gains heading into year's end.

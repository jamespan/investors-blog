The bulls were running free as the stock market finished July with a flourish on Friday. And while it may be too early to celebrate with fireworks, the fact that the market passed some key tests is worthy of increased optimism.




In a potentially dangerous week dominated by Big Tech earnings and the latest Fed meeting, indexes still managed to power higher. It seems Wall Street is increasingly inclined to believe the economy is turning a corner.


But investors still need to be nimble. With the stock market having its best month since 2020, it would not be unusual for it to digest some gains. We also remain in the midst of earnings season. As ever, use the daily action of the major indexes and performance of the current stock market leaders as your main guide.


Stock Market Uptrend Strengthens
--------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite fared best as it moved 1.9% higher Friday. It posted strong gains in each of the past three sessions and finished the month with a mammoth 12.6% gain. This was its best July on record. Nevertheless, it remains down almost 21% year-to-date.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP072922-273x300.jpg)The S&P 500 closed near session highs as it powered up 1.4%. It used a test of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) at the start of the week as a springboard to a 4.3% weekly gain. The index also wiped out its last remaining [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) due to a 5% advance from that day, a bullish sign.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) made a noteworthy move following [an encouraging quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-soars-in-reaction-to-earnings-report/). It was the top performer on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 after it exploded 10.4%. Analysts cheered robust consumer demand and improved fulfillment network optimization.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) was mostly positive. Energy and consumer discretionary fared best as only health and consumer staples fell.


Blue chips joined the party, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1%. **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) ripped 8.9% higher while **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) got a post-earnings boost of 3.3%.


Small caps rose a more modest 0.7% on the Russell 2000, while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fared slightly better with a 0.9% gain.

Solar Stocks Shine Again
------------------------


It is always key for stock market investors to keep track of the leading industry groups.


Dairy products, oil & gas equipment plays and periodical companies were among those faring best. Solar stocks also continued to shine following the news that Sen. Joe Manchin struck a deal Wednesday on spending with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.


[Leaderboard play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) Invesco Solar ([TAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAN)) is now extended past both a trendline entry and a 78.92 standard buy point as it ended the week up 18.9%.


On the downside, the movies industry group, which is dominated by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), lagged most. Educational software and food wholesalers also struggled.

Investors got a stern reminder of why the market uptrend is under pressure Wednesday as sellers came into the stock market in afternoon trading.


The stock market was in a good mood early, comforted by news that President Trump's plan to crack down on Chinese investments in U.S. firms could be less harsh than initially thought.


The Dow Jones industrial average led early, rising as much as 1.2%. It pared gains significantly, ending with a loss of 0.7%, but **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) held up as oil prices jumped again. The blue-chip index closed below its 200-day moving average after a meager attempt at support Tuesday.


Nasdaq Takes More Heat
----------------------


The Nasdaq composite took out Monday's low, ending with a loss of 1.5%. The Nasdaq ended less than 1% above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average, falling 0.9%. Nasdaq volume rose from Tuesday's levels and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE higher. The May 22 distribution day fell off the S&P 500 count because enough time has passed to make it no longer relevant.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MP062718-229x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite didn't stage much of a rally after Monday's 2.1% decline. It more than halved an intraday gain of nearly 0.9% Tuesday, and it reversed lower Wednesday after rising 0.5% intraday. There wasn't a specific headline that fueled Wednesday's selling — just a continuation of Monday's selling that saw leading growth stocks take it on the chin.


Monday's selling was intense and Wednesday's action didn't exactly support the bull thesis.


To be sure, some of the more unsettling price action has come from the enterprise software group, a top-performing group over the past six months. While selling pressure has been tame in **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), other top performers in the group are now below their 50-day moving averages. They include **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)), **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)), **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **RingCentral** ([RING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RING)), among others.


Software groups were among the day's worst performers as enterprise, database and medical software firms took hits. Biotechs and chip stocks also lagged.


Meanwhile, several China leaders have come under pressure in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). **YY Inc**. ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) and **Huazhu Group** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)) were the hardest hit components Wednesday, with losses ranging from 4% to 5.5%. Headed into Wednesday, the index of leading growth stocks was down 2.3% for the week. It fell another 2.3% Wednesday.


Stock Market Leaders: Oil Stocks
--------------------------------


In the energy space, **Marathon Oil** ([MRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRO)) gained more than 2%. It's only 4% off its high as it works on a flat base with a 22.22 buy point. Meanwhile, **Wildhorse Resource Development** ([WRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WRD)) reclaimed its 50-day moving average with conviction early but closed with a whimper.


**EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) closed strongly, rising 3.5%. It's [approaching the top of a flat base](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-of-the-day-apple-oil-eog-resources-buy-point/) with a 128.13 entry.



U.S. crude oil futures settled at $72.76 a barrel, up 3.2%, after U.S. weekly inventory data showed a drop of 9.9 million barrels.


IPO **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) was a bright spot. Shares closed at 23.99 after pricing Tuesday night at 16. Lovesac is a small company, with a market capitalization below $500 million, but sales growth has been accelerating in recent quarters. In its latest quarter, sales jumped 52% from the year-ago period to $26.8 billion. The company caters to the millenial crowd, selling premium couches and beanbag chairs.

U.S. stock indexes stood pat Friday despite an unexpectedly low number on March payrolls and the previous evening's news of a U.S. cruise missile attack on Syria.


The Nasdaq and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average finished flat, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1%.

Stocks showed no sharp reactions to the U.S. attack on Syria. Even IBD's aerospace and defense industry group climbed only 0.7%.


Meanwhile, before the market's open, bad news came on payrolls. March payrolls added 98,000 jobs vs. the consensus for 180,000. The number was well below every estimate in the range.


Normally a market that can shrug off negative news is showing strength. But neither the bulls nor the bears have been able to sustain a move lately. Over the past six weeks, the Nasdaq has been in an alternate pattern of one week up, one week down.


Such action is more like troops waiting in the trenches than like a confident army on the move.


Resistance has developed around the 5910 to 5935 levels on the Nasdaq, giving the chart a sideways look. The S&P 500 has run into resistance at the 2400 to 2375 levels, but its action looks more like a pullback.


On Friday, top-rated stocks on the move were scarce.


Chipmaker **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) sprinted 3% higher in heavy volume. Qorvo is rated No. 3 among 37 chipmakers in IBD's [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-qorvo-inc-qrvo.aspx).


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) rose almost 1% as it shapes a flat base, best seen on the daily chart. Boeing is the third highest-priced issue on the price-weighted Dow Jones industrial average, which means it was boosting the Dow Friday.


On the downside, **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) plunged 6% in heavy volume. Research firm M Science said Q1 sales would miss views. The stock sliced through its 10-week moving average in volume 39% above-average, a sell signal after a tremendous advance.


In the coming week, banks will be in the spotlight. Three major banks will report Q1 results Thursday.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) will release Q1 results before Thursday's open. The Street expects earnings to edge up 3%. **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) will report Q1 results before Thursday's open. Analysts expect earnings to rise 12%. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) will release Q1 results Thursday a half-hour after the open. The Street expects earnings to drop 2%.


Under The Hood On The Jobs Miss
-------------------------------


The March payroll numbers came in 44% lower than expected. What happened? Let's look under the hood.


On a sequential basis, construction in March added 53,000 fewer jobs than in February. Health and education added 50,000 fewer than the previous month. So, those two areas alone accounted for most of the damage.


Meanwhile, retail jobs *declined* almost 30,000 in March, which roughly matched February's decline. On the upside, the professional and business services segment added 20,000 jobs.


What's Pressuring This Uptrend?
-------------------------------


Market commentators have no shortage of suspects: Almost 80 days into the Trump administration, the Republicans have failed to do much of what business or free market advocates had hoped for on ObamaCare, taxes, trade and Dodd-Frank bank regulations. There's just enough uncertainty cutting both ways on those budget and economic issues to keep the bulls and the bears off balance.


The bears' best opportunities have emerged in select sectors. For example, gloom-and-doom talk is surrounding the beaten-down apparel and retail sectors.


The weakness has been attributed to **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) taking market share from bricks-and-mortar stores. No doubt that's part of the story. But the weakness has also showed up among retailers serving the upscale or aspirational customers.


For example, revenue at **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) has dropped or been flat for the past three quarters. **Ralph Lauren's** ([RL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RL)) revenue has fallen in each of the past seven quarters. Revenue growth has decelerated for three consecutive quarters at **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


**Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) has been stuck with revenue growth that has averaged less than 3% over the past six quarters.


Have the wealthy, and those who wish to appear wealthy, given up shopping?


One thin piece of good news is the recent improvements for **Tiffany & Co.** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)), a high-end, worldwide jewelry retailer. After four quarters of declining sales, revenue grew 1% in each of the past two quarters.


Still, that is a long way short of five years ago when Tiffany's revenue grew 18%.


Tiffany's results are linked to consumer confidence. The Conference Board reported in late March that its consumer confidence gauge hit its highest level since December 2000. There may be hope yet for retail, apparel and jewelry.

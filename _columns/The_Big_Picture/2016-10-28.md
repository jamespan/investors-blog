U.S. stock indexes took a politically inspired hit Friday, as news broke that the FBI was investigating newly discovered emails from Hillary Clinton's personal email server.


The Nasdaq settled with a 0.5% loss after being up 0.3%. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average edged down less than 0.1%. The IBD 50 rose 0.3%.


All three indexes remain under their [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Volume fell on both major exchanges.


![mp102816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP102816-155x300.png)The stock market is not an ideological gauge, but it does vote with its money based on who is likely to win the presidency and what that means for various sectors. Friday's FBI surprise could undermine Clinton's standing and force adjustments in investment allocations.


At the very least, the development created uncertainty for the day, which the market hates. The key test may emerge next week, when fund managers have had the weekend to mull whether they should lighten up on stocks, adjust allocations or stand pat.


The political news overshadowed the release of data on third-quarter GDP. The figure came in at 2.9%, topping the consensus estimate of 2.5% growth but staying under the highest estimate in the range, which was 3.1%.


Even before the FBI-related news, the market wasn't getting a lot of traction out of the GDP numbers. The figures can sometimes change wildly from one revision to another. So in some ways, the report on gross domestic product is an inkblot test for the bulls and the bears. The figure ends up meaning whatever the market says it means.


On Friday, the market's morning action suggested that the Street didn't regard the growth as too convincing. The U.S. economy may be moving faster, but it's still limping.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *President Eisenhower's election [unleashed a bull market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eisenhowers-bull-market-in-first-term-provided-a-lot-to-like/). Could it happen again with the 2016 candidates? (Probably not.)*

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment reading also was released. The Street expected 88.5 but got 87.2.


IBD-style investors have a simple method for dealing with markets such as this one.


The IBD-style investor will concentrate holdings in no more than a few stocks and then listen to the coach. The coach in this case is the stock market itself. Allocations can be reduced when a stock drops 7% or 8% below its buy point, or when it reaches the 20% to 25% profit-taking zone, or when the market is not rewarding breakouts.


Even if an investor started out fully invested in this uptrend (unlikely considering the market's flawed action), selling a stock can reduce exposure once 20% profits are booked. And barring rare circumstances, there is no reason to re-enter the market after a sale if the market is acting weird.


Weirdness in this market has come in the form of stocks that break out and then linger low in the 5% buy zone, in stocks that react hysterically to less-than-perfect quarterly results, and in stocks that lose their 50-day moving average in heavy volume.


Action like that favors prudent action or more likely prudent inaction.


The Federal Reserve will conduct its November meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, but CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds of a rate hike at only 9%. The rate hike is expected to come in December.


For the week, most of the indexes fell. The Nasdaq lost 1.3%, and the S&P 500 trimmed 0.7%. The IBD 50 dropped 2.7%, but the blue chip Dow rose 0.1%.

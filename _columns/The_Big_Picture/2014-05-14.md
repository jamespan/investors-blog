Market Down As Stock Leaders' Bases Still Need Work
====================================================

The stock market cooled off in quieter trade Wednesday, a day after data showed that retail sales paused in April.


Small-cap stocks did worse in Wednesday's decline. Leading stocks didn't behave much better.


The Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%, eating into a solid two-day advance begun Friday. The tech-heavy index got hit by declines of 1% or more by **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Volume declined on the Nasdaq, indicating that fund managers weren't that eager to distribute shares. Yet the questionable health of the Nasdaq overall may hint it could be a while before true buying demand returns.


IBD is not in the game of predicting what will happen in the market â€” be it next week, month or year. But a few trends point to a Nasdaq market that is still fatigued, suggesting that stocks may need more time to digest the hearty gains reaped over a four-year span since the index's March 9, 2009 bottom.


The Nasdaq advance-decline line continues to trend lower, even as the Nasdaq has risen nearly 6% from its April 15 intraday low of 3946. That's a curious divergence. You'd prefer to see more stocks participate when a market rallies in earnest.


Two, the IPO market is still red-hot, but so far in 2014 there have not yet been many recent new issues that truly symbolize the emergence of fresh leadership. This may change, however, when Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba goes public.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.5%, snapping a mild three-day winning streak.


Institutional investors concentrated their selling in industry groups that spanned from Building-Wood Products to Building-Heavy Construction to media, finance and retail-oriented groups.


The Russell 2000 got smacked, falling 1.6%. The small-cap gauge has been down as much as 10% below its recent high of 1212. It is now 9% below that peak.


The IBD 50 slid 0.9%.


On Thursday and Friday, market players will receive new readings on the economy from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, the Empire State manufacturing survey and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey.


There's already plenty of evidence over the past two weeks that the U.S. economy continues to accelerate. Yet the stock market has likely already priced in such progress.


Stocks with exceptional growth are still in the early to middle innings of their base work.


**Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) has corrected more than 35% from its 124.42 peak. It's now living below the 50-day moving average, a worrisome sign.


**Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) is having a positive week so far, up 1.7%. It's trying to smash a streak of seven straight weeks of living below its 10-week line.

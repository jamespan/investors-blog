  China Tariff Threats Punch Stocks Today, But This Index Shows A Bullish Reversal

The Nasdaq composite, fresh from rising six weeks in a row, and most other indexes got off to a rough start Monday. But [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) cut losses amid strong signs that both the U.S. and China are having a tough time in agreeing to a bilateral trade deal and avoiding an escalation in import tariffs.




Trading desks across the world braced for a bad open. President Donald Trump on Sunday tweeted the possibility that he would go ahead with 25% import tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of China imports.


It was the clearest signal yet in weeks that the two largest global economies are struggling to meet in the middle on trade. News wires reported that China intends to send a delegation to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, but did not clarify if senior officials would attend.


The Nasdaq composite showed the worst drop among the major indexes. But a 0.5% decline by day's end seemed mild when compared with the 2.2% drubbing it took soon after the opening bell. The Nasdaq 100, which houses the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, fell nearly 0.7%.


Mild Drop By Large Caps
-----------------------


The S&P 500 dropped less than 0.5%. It would have been a bigger drop if large investors did not go bargain-hunting within the beaten-down medical sector. Defensive issues, such as food, edged higher. Investors rushed into long-term U.S. government bonds. The benchmark Treasury 10-year yield fell 3 basis points to 2.51%.

Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq and fell slightly on the NYSE, according to early data.


Turnover-wise, that clearly wasn't the case early Monday. Volume moved at a brisk pace in the first couple hours of trading, but began to slow down around lunchtime in New York.


Bloomberg reported that Trump decided to tweet a renewed intention to impose higher tariffs, as well as consider new 25% tariffs on an additional $325 billion in Chinese goods, after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer saw a move by China to backtrack on intentions to rewrite laws that force American companies to reveal proprietary technology and other intellectual property while doing business there.


Stocks Today Show A Positive Reversal By This Index
---------------------------------------------------


The Russell 2000 erased a morning decline of 1.6% and ended nearly 1 point higher. That ranked as one of the bright spots of the session. A number of leading stocks also reversed higher. That's just the sort of bullish action you want to see in a confirmed market uptrend.



**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), security software plays **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), and longtime market leader **Ulta** **Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) all fit the bill in this case. Ulta ranks within the top 20 [in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


China Stocks Are Falling Harder
-------------------------------


The downside risk of an escalating trade war for the Chinese economy appears to be just as great, if not greater, than for the U.S.


Overnight, the Shanghai composite plunged 5.6% and fell more than 10% below its 52-week high. Earlier, the index logged four clear days of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) as well — significant declines of 0.2% or more in higher turnover vs. the prior session. This negative action points to an unusually high amount of profit-taking by institutions.


Without the support of strong buying by large funds, no rally can advance far.


IBD readers can see the daily charts of relevant ETFs such as iShares China Large Cap ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) and SPDR S&P China ([GXC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GXC)) and notice the numerous drops of 1% or more in heavier volume since April.


Stocks Today: Watching This Yardstick Of Market Leaders
-------------------------------------------------------



Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an exchange traded fund, also shaved much of its early loss of 2.6%, but it still fell more than 0.6%. At 34.03, FFTY holds a solid year-to-date gain of 23.2%.


Leading stocks certainly got shaken up a bit, and a few tested key areas of support, chart-wise. **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) offers one example. The maker of specialty equipment for the fiber-optic data networking market slid below its 50-day moving average with a 5.5% drop to 55.78 in heavy turnover. When stocks cut below the 50-day line after a strong move and fail to rebound quickly, they usually point to a significant correction. That's the time to defend your gains and sell.


In addition to China trade talks, keep an eye on another full slate of [corporate earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) this week.


The outsize moves in reaction to quarterly results, plus any surprise news on the global economy, reiterate one of IBD's most important rules: [Take at least some profits on the way up](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/), especially when the gain in your stock reaches 20% to 25% or more.

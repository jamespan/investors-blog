Stocks Fall, But These 3 Factors Give Market A Bullish Tone
============================================================

Stocks took a rest on Wednesday, one day after the major indexes signaled that a new market uptrend is likely in the works. Yet the decline masked underlying strength across a decent range of industries that spanned from the energy sector to high tech.




The Nasdaq composite showed seesaw trading before ending the day off less than 0.4%. Volume fell. The S&P 500 slipped nearly 0.6% as homebuilder, building products, steel, farm equipment, airline, money center bank and auto-related shares sold off.


The decline would have been worse if the market hadn't seen a strong rise across the energy sector.


At least 18 of IBD's 197 industry groups actually rallied 1% or more. Among the top 10 performers, six were oil and gas-related.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP041118-273x300.jpg)Lodging, fiber optic gear, ship transport and medical software stocks also thrived with gains of more than 1%.


Interestingly, despite declines for the S&P 500 and the NYSE composite, winners edged losers on the Big Board exchange by a slim margin of 35 issues. That's a curious divergence, supporting the fact that numerous industries defied the decline. (You can see the specific data, as well as the NYSE advance-decline line, within the large daily chart of the S&P 500 on the General Market Indicators PDF. Access it via the link at the bottom of this column.)


On the Nasdaq, losers beat winners by a margin of fewer than 100 stocks.


One Positive Factor
-------------------


When stocks pull back right after a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/), lower volume is ideal for market bulls. It suggests that the bears are still hibernating, while other fund managers are less eager to sell into the current rally.


At 7069, the Nasdaq remains the leading market index with a gain since Jan. 1, up 2.4%. It gained 28.2% in 2017, well outpacing the S&P 500's 19.4% advance the same year.


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq initially dropped 0.5% at the open. President Trump warned via social media that Russia should be prepared for incoming U.S. missiles to strike Syria in the wake of another suspected chemical weapons attack on the war-ravaged nation's rebel population.


But that turned out to be the session low. The Nasdaq rebounded and expanded nearly 0.5% ahead of the release of [minutes from the Federal Reserve's March 20-21 meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-minutes-federal-reserve-rate-hike-outlook/) on interest rates. The U.S. central bank hiked the cost of money for the sixth time since December 2015, raising the fed funds target rate to a range of 1.5%-1.75%.


Late Wednesday, the White House told reporters it had no timetable for a potential missile launch. Yet the threat of military conflict alone seemed to encourage traders to expand exposure in hard assets including crude oil and gold.


U.S. near-term oil futures have now crossed back above the $66 level and are up more than 8% since Jan. 1, better than U.S. equity benchmarks.


The S&P 500, finishing Wednesday's session at 2642, is down 1.2% since Jan. 1. The S&P SmallCap 600, which rallied 0.2% on Wednesday, is up 1.6% year to date.


It may be tempting to freely buy any oil and gas stock with the intent to cash in on the sudden interest in oil. Don't. Some of the very best stock market winners do in fact hail from the oil and gas sector. But proper bases need to form, and these commodity-driven stocks also must show heavy volume on the breakout day or week.



**Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) is doing something that former big market winners rarely do: show enough strength to form new bases and break out successfully. The Enid, Okla., oil and gas developer shuffled a bit sideways after clearing a 58.99 buy point in a nine-week [cup without handle](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) on March 23.


Yet Continental never fell enough to force new buyers to execute the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


The Street sees Continental's earnings soaring to 61 cents a share in the first quarter, up from 2 cents a year ago. Full-year profit is seen rising 376% to $2.43 a share.


Other new breakouts in the energy sector include **HollyFrontier** ([HFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HFC)), the jet fuel maker that cleared a narrow handle on its 10-week cup base at 50.60 on April in light volume. The handle meets the minimum length of five trading sessions, but can only be seen on a daily chart.


None of the nine current members on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) hail directly from the oil and gas sector for now. But one member, Houston-basedÂ **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)), is involved in shipping black oil, petrochemicals, refined crude oil products, and other commodities.


In other lists, energy plays such as **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), [No. 1 in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), and 11th-ranked **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)), which is making a second attempt at clearing a 26.29 entry in a cup without handle.


**Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) ranks No. 50 and is forming a potential new base that shows [elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).


With the market back in a confirmed uptrend for the first time in more than a month, it's the right time to update your watch list, look for high-quality bases to complete, identify the top sectors and industries, and buy when a stock thrusts past the correct buy point in a rush of volume.


Are you seeing boatloads of such stocks breaking out now? Not likely. Take [Tuesday's follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-surge-tariff-relief-bullish-shift-market/). Only 57 stocks on the Nasdaq and 47 on the NYSE made IBD's screened list of new highs. Many stocks are still licking their wounds and need more time to properly rebound and set up proper buy points.


Already, 2018 has been a feast of sellers. The major indexes have staged two intermediate-level corrections in three months. No such decline of 10% or more ever happened in all of 2017.


Positive Factor No. 2
---------------------


Bullishness, no surprise, has been steadily declining. On Wednesday, the bulls-bears ratio from Investors Intelligence showed a sharp drop in bullishness, now at 42.2%. It's the third straight week of a sub-50% reading.


That's actually good for equities. If everyone is wildly optimistic, the market would lack a set of new buyers to keep the uptrend alive.


See the bulls-bears ratio and other gauges of investor sentiment by going to the [Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) section.



Another positive factor that should not be ignored: The Q1 earnings outlook looks pretty good.


IBD 50 Earnings Growth
----------------------


Within the IBD 50 alone, as many as 27 firms are forecast to deliver a first-quarter earnings increase of 40% or more.


They include Brazilian digital payments expert **PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) (EPS estimate of 18 cents, up 200%) and gym operator **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) (EPS estimate of 27 cents, up 42%). Both companies are among the nine currently featured in [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/).

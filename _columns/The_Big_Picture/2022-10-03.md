  Stock Market Bulls Awaken From Slumber; Is October Time To Buy? Tesla Pummeled

The stock market indexes bounced overnight and rallied strongly in Monday's session, after the U.K. prime minister pared a tax cut scheme that had raised fears of financial contagion. Interestingly, the rebound on the first trading day of the fourth quarter excluded **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).




The megacap electric-vehicle, solar and battery storage giant got pummeled despite record deliveries, dropping 8.6% after a key competitor reported strong sales of a Tesla Model 3 alternative.


Major benchmarks posted strong gains but all remain far below their 50- and 200-day moving averages. This is telling investors to maintain a defensive approach to market exposure.


However, investors can now start the [follow-through day checklist](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), looking for additional buying interest to emerge later this week. Of course, that won't matter if another ugly reversal sets into motion, like it has so many times this year, and equities give up Monday's gains.


The Dow Industrial Average ended the bullish session with a 2.7% gain, while the S&P 500 added 2.6%. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.3%, underperforming the Russell 2000's lift of almost 2.7%.


Volume fell mildly on both the NYSE and Nasdaq compared to Friday's session, early data showed.


Stock Market In Correction, Demands Patience
--------------------------------------------


Bond prices rose and yields fell, dropping the 10-year Treasury note to 3.65%, a seven-day low.


Even after Monday's rebound, the stock market remains in correction, warning investors to be very careful about taking new exposure.


IBD founder William O'Neil taught that [CAN SLIM strategies](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) do not work as well in bear markets as they do in bull markets. Buying [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in these conditions can be extremely risky because most stocks sell off during extended downturns.

It's the major reason why waiting, watching and holding lots of cash is a great strategy for tough market environments.


Disciplined and veteran IBD readers see this risk in many [IBD 50 stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) these days, watching when positive price action hits proper buy points and brings in hopeful buyers. The rally continues for a few days and stalls out, dumping the stock into a choppy sideways pattern between the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) and 20% [profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


It's fine when a leadership stock pauses to rest and consolidate. But many of these patterns are followed by nasty sell-offs that slice through buy points and sell zones.


When holding positions in these dead zones, investors should think about opportunity vs. cost.


Simply stated, are you better off sitting on your hands and letting price action unfold, or should that money be sitting in your cash box, or in another industry group that's showing more immediate interest?


Stock Market Enters Bullish October; Time To Buy?
-------------------------------------------------


The [Stock Trader's Almanac](http://www.stocktradersalmanac.com) calls October the "Bear-Killer and Bargain Month," marking the start of the best three-month period of the year, according to historical data. The 55-year old publication notes the tendency to post a "substantial price rise" between the beginning of October and the second-trading day of January.


It identifies investment funds as the source of the turnaround, noting that annual allocations into these funds have "helped stem the tide of at least five major bear markets."


Current Almanac Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Hersch says the "original theory from the 1969 Almanac still holds water.


"October has been a turnaround month — a 'bear killer.' Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&P 500 declined 19.4%). Seven of these years were midterm bottoms."


IBD 50 Winners And Losers
-------------------------



**Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)) exploded higher, gaining more than 12%. It rocketed through the 27.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) within a narrow [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and closed at an all-time high, sharply above the 5% buy zone.


The stock holds a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and 99 EPS Rating.


The nursing staffing specialist also boasts annualized growth of 55% in earnings per share over the past five years, but profits are forecast to decline 38% in 2023.


**ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) surged 8.2%, underpinned by a strong crude oil market.


Ranked 18th on the IBD 50 list headed into Monday's trading, COP stock is trying to form a new base after a cup-with-handle breakout trapped buyers in a September reversal. The recovery effort started last week at the 10-day line, indicating strong support.


Just seven stocks on the elite list lost ground, including top-ranked **Clearfield** ([CLFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLFD)). The fiber optics company reversed at the 10-week line, waving a red flag despite perfect 99/99 Composite and EPS ratings.


In The EV Space
---------------



Meanwhile, outside the IBD 50, Chinese Tesla rival **BYD** ([BYDDF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYDDF)) reported booming September sales, topping 200,000 for the first time. Q3 deliveries surged above 500,000.


The upstart has added several new models, including a Tesla Model 3 rival and is expanding into new markets, including Europe. Investors ignored strong Tesla deliveries after the news, worried about competition for overseas markets.


Yet like Tesla, BYD is deep in the middle of a new base in the works.

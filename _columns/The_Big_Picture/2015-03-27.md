Stocks shifted sideways in quiet volume Friday, ending a difficult week on a light note.

  

The Nasdaq rose 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The IBD 50 popped 1.2%.

  

Volume fell across the board.

  

The indexes' charts were little changed Friday. The S&P 500 stayed under its 50-day line, and the Nasdaq held above its 50-day.

  

The day's gains came in fading volume after two days of losses in rising volume. It's the opposite of what bulls prefer to see.

  

In a weekly context, the action also was bad. Both indexes picked up two distribution days during the week. It was a disappointment for the bulls, considering the previous week involved two clear days of accumulation.

  

Accumulation refers to strong gains in rising volume, which is the footprint of institutional buying. Distribution refers to sizable losses in rising volume, which is the mark of institutional selling.

  

The monthly picture for stocks looks even worse. In the 20 sessions so far this month, eight revealed distribution while three showed accumulation.

  

With the uptrend under pressure, individual investors face a decision either to dig in and hold positions or to lighten up on exposure.

  

If an investor decides to hold a position, he or she should watch for sell signals. A stock that drops 7% or 8% under the investor's buy point should be sold.

  

True, sometimes a stock will recover in all or part after tripping the sell rule. (**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) did as much Thursday.) The goal, though, isn't to guess right but to protect the portfolio from major damage.

  

Part of the market's problem now could be tied to corporate buybacks and the quiet period before earnings. A Goldman Sachs analyst pointed out last fall that most companies aren't allowed to do open-market buybacks in the five weeks leading up to their earnings reports.

  

With the earnings season about to swing into action in the first and second full weeks of April, some companies will slip into the five-week quiet period.

  

If that truly is the problem, then the market should see more buyback action sometime after companies release results.

  

Some research shows that corporate buybacks have been a chief driver of the bull market that began in 2009. A sluggish recovery — on Friday, Q4 growth came in at a weaker than expected 2.2% — and low interest rates have given many companies no better place for their cash.

  

For the week, the IBD 50 lost 3.6%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 cut 2.7% and 2.2% respectively.

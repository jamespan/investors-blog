  Stock Market Ends Squarely Lower On Reignited China Trade Fears; PagSeguro, Pinduoduo Plunge

The stock market ended Wednesday's trading session squarely lower — but off session lows — after Reuters reported the U.S.-China "phase one" trade deal may not be completed this year.




The Nasdaq composite sold off as much as 1.2% before trimming losses to 0.5%. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed with a 0.4%, or 112-point, decline.


Tensions between the two nations have been rising in the wake of the continued Hong Kong protests. Late Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill supporting the Hong Kong protesters. According to the [Reuters report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-timing/phase-one-u-s-china-trade-deal-may-not-be-completed-this-year-trade-sources-idUSKBN1XU2C7?il=0), China is pushing for more significant tariff reductions, while the White House is hesitant to do so without addressing key trade issues, like intellectual property. Meanwhile, additional tariffs on Chinese goods are still scheduled to kick in on Dec. 15.

Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE rose relative to Tuesday's turnover.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP112019-265x300.jpg)Wednesday's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) (down 0.2% or more on higher volume than the previous day) was the first sign of institutional selling since Nov. 6. (There was a day of bearish stalling on Nov. 12.) Be on the lookout for clusters of distribution days or sharp sell-offs in price. This bearish price action would indicate that more caution is necessary.


For now, the market's advance may have slowed, but it's not exactly in peril. On Tuesday, all three major indexes reached record highs, and the bounce off session lows was positive.


IBD 50 Edges Higher, But PagSeguro Plunges On Earnings
------------------------------------------------------


Our index of leading growth stocks — the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) — edged higher, easily beating the major indexes. [Innovator IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/ibd-indexes/ibd-etf-indexes-ibd-50-etf-leaders-breakout-stocks-etf-ffty-ldrs-bout/) ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) snapped a nine-day winning streak. The ETF of top growth stocks reached its highest level since Aug. 1 and is about 3% from a 52-week high.


Leading the downside movers was Brazilian payment processor **PagSeguro** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)). The stock plunged 17% to close at 30.48 after the [company's weak earnings results.](https://www.investors.com/news/pagseguro-earnings-stoneco-earnings-q3-2019/) Shares hit their lowest level since May 23. Rival **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) slid 2.7% in sympathy. Shares closed just above their 50-day line. Warren Buffett-backed StoneCo [will report quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/research/investing-action-plan/tesla-truck-unveiling-retail-stocks-report-earnings/) after the stock market close Thursday.


On the upside, retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) gained 4.1%, reviving support at the 50-day average. In bullish news for the retail sector, **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) [reported strong results](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q3-2019-target-stock/) before the stock market open, sending shares surging 14%.


Stock Market Lesson — Pinduoduo Stock
-------------------------------------



Every day, the stock market offers a crash course in how to invest. Sometimes the education is profitable, other times painful. For Pinduoduo stock, Wednesday's lesson was definitely painful. Shares crashed 23% Wednesday on [disappointing results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinduoduo-earnings-report-disappoints-chinese-e-commerce-giant-dives/). Pinduoduo had been [one of the top growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/pinduoduo-stock-breaks-out-new-buy-point-us-china-trade-war/) in the current stock market rally to record highs.


On Oct. 24, Pinduoduo stock broke out powerfully above a 36.99 buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/). Just nine sessions later, the stock hit the [20%-25% profit-taking zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) from the buy point. Most profits should be taken at this level, according to IBD research; however, the stock also indicated huge power in its quick advance. No matter how bullish you are on the company's fundamental story, it's prudent to take some profits off the table at the appropriate time and place. Avoiding a large downside move — even partially — is just as important as capturing a big upside move.

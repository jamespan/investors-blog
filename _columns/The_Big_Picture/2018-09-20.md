Stock Indexes Break Through Resistance, But Leaders Lag
========================================================

Stock indexes sprinted ahead Thursday, as the Nasdaq broke resistance at 8000 and the S&P 500 and the Dow scored new highs.




The Nasdaq chalked up a 1% gain, while the Dow Jones industrial average echoed the gain. The S&P 500 added 0.8%. Small caps trailed early but closed the gap as the S&P 600 finished up 0.9%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The Nasdaq's gap up above 8000 looked decisive. Likewise, the S&P 500 and the Dow showed confidence as they gapped up to new highs.


(A [gap up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) involves an open above the previous session's high and trade that stays above that level. Whether it's an index or an individual stock, the action is bullish.)

Distribution involves a loss in a major index in rising volume. Such action points to institutional selling.


Thursday was the opposite of distribution as prices and volume rose. Called accumulation, it is a sign of institutional buying.


Buying Almost Everything
------------------------


What were funds buying?


In one sense, they were buying almost everything. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, advancers led declining groups by a 7-1 ratio.


The day's big gainers included fiber optics, construction equipment, auto and truck original equipment, oil drillers, chipmakers and superregional banks.


On the downside, RVs and department stores suffered.


Blue chips were up almost without exception. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) led with 2% gains each.


Eight stocks rose 1.5% or more in the 30-component Dow.


In the S&P 500, **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) jumped almost 7% in heavy volume. The company announced it would lay off 3% of its workforce by March.


Under Armour's stock began sliding in October 2015. The stock has been rising in an awkward fashion since November. The sports apparel marketer's earnings are expected to decline 16% this year, but then rise 106% in 2019.


How Good Was Thursday? Even Banks Rose
--------------------------------------


Even the banks posted nice price gains. Banks have been stuck in raggedy consolidations for the past six to eight months.


On Thursday, **U.S. Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)) added to Wednesday's low-volume breakout. The stock is 1% above a 54.82 buy point. [For more on U.S. Bancorp](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/top-bank-stocks-us-bancorp-bond-yields/), see Wednesday's Industry Themes column.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) closed in on a 119.43 buy point in a flat base. Aggressive investors might see an early entry at 118.39, but the stock lacked heavy volume when it cleared that point Thursday.


**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) popped 1.3% Thursday after rising 3.3% Wednesday. The stock is climbing the right side of a saucer base.


China Plays A Card
------------------


China may have been partly responsible for Thursday's broad gains in the U.S. stock market. A Bloomberg News article reported that China plans to cut tariffs on imports as soon as October.


Thursday's stock market session had at least one oddity. Although gains were broadly based, the Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rose only 0.5% and leaders up in volume were scarce.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 201,000, which was 4% fewer than expected and the lowest level in almost 49 years.


The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business outlook came in at 22.9, above estimates for 19.6.


Look for a busy day Friday, which is a quadruple witching session. Witching involves the expiration of stock index and single stock futures, and stock index options and single stock options.


Often that leads to higher volume for the day.

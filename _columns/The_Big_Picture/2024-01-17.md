When someone asks you what's going on in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/), sometimes it's as simple as these four words: Yields up, stocks down.




The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose sharply for a second straight session. It finished up 4 basis points to 4.10%, according to Cboe data.


That's a 15-basis-point hike in two days, and the 10-year note made its highest close since Dec. 12.


The culprit for this sell-off? Strong December retail sales in the U.S., which jumped 0.6%, well above the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a 0.4% rise. That figure also accelerated from a 0.3% increase in November.


Stock market pundits interpreted the positive news as dampening prospects for the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates in the coming months.


Treasury securities pay a fixed interest payment on bonds. So when bond prices fall, the yield on those bonds go up. And higher yields these days make fixed-income investments generally more attractive relative to stocks.


Stock Market Today: Keep An Eye On Bonds Too
--------------------------------------------


![Market Pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP011724-215x300.jpg)Beyond the headline retail sales data, core retail sales, which strips out volatile gasoline and vehicle prices, also impressed. Core sales lifted 0.6% month on month, soaring above economists' views for a 0.3% increase and matching the prior month's increase.


"The American consumer not only bought everything in sight over Christmas, she bought the Federal Reserve more time to hold rates higher a little longer," Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Va., wrote in a comment emailed to IBD. "These data are very consistent with 2% growth (in the economy), providing a major win for the fight on inflation."


According to CME FedWatch, the probability of the U.S. central bank trimming the fed funds rate at least a quarter point from the current target range of 5.25%-5.5% at the upcoming March 20 meeting on interest rate policy has dropped to 55% from 65% a week ago.


The Nasdaq, however, also revealed a resilient character. Down as much as 1.6% at around 10 a.m. ET, the composite index battled its way back throughout the remainder of the session to cut that loss to just under 0.6%. The Nasdaq also closed at the high of its intraday range. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 squeezed an early 1.1% loss to less than 0.6% by day's end.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down less than 0.3%. Volume fell on both the Nasdaq and NYSE.

Beyond The Stock Market: Commodities Mixed
------------------------------------------


Crude oil got a boost, even as the U.S. dollar strengthened again.


Oil futures after the market close edged higher to $72.82 a barrel and have now gained 2% for the year. Light sweet crude oil ended 2023 at $71.33.


But gold continues to struggle in 2024. At $2,011 an ounce, it's fallen almost 3% since Jan. 1. When the dollar rises, the price of gold gets pricier for overseas investors.



Gold miner **Alamos Gold** ([AGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGI)) has taken a bath so far in January. On Wednesday, shares nearly touched 12 before rebounding a bit. But AGI still fell 0.7% to 12.28 and closed below the 200-day moving average for a second straight day.


Alamos Gold has made a disappointing round trip of a 15% gain after it broke out past a fairly narrow [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 12.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on Nov. 3.


Back To The Nasdaq And S&P 500
------------------------------



A daily chart of both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 shows the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) may also be worth a close look. Both major indexes tested support at their 21-day lines for the second time in nearly three weeks.


IBD research finds that a solid stock market and solid-acting market leaders tend to attract buyers at or near their 21-day exponential averages during the early periods of their big moves.


That clearly isn't the case with the Russell 2000.


Small Caps Underperform
-----------------------



On Wednesday, the small-cap gauge sank 0.7% for a fourth straight decline. That marked a 2.9% slide overall. Plus it follows the Russell's undercut of the 21-day line on Jan. 3.


Perhaps the pullback in small caps is in fact healthy.


After a rough October, the Russell bottomed at 1633, then leapt more than 400 points, or 27%, to a peak of 2071. That kind of gain in nine weeks hardly seems sustainable. However, the Russell may be positioned to test support at its rising 50-day moving average.


If it does, interpret the action as an up-to-date measure of the strength of current demand for smaller issues.


So for now, IBD's suggested exposure level to stocks remains at 80%-100%.


Elsewhere, the NYSE composite joined the Russell in slicing through the 21-day line as it fell 0.7%. At 16,522, the NYSE composite is down almost 2% year to date.


Indeed, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) on the S&P 500 remains relatively high. But among the five distribution sessions that currently count within a rolling 25-day period, actually only one of those sell-offs in higher NYSE turnover actually exceeded 1% â€” namely, a 1.5% drop on Dec. 20.


That [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) will expire on time on Jan. 29.


A Sell Signal For Duolingo
--------------------------


A look at the stock market leadership showed few cracks in bullish behavior. As such, current holdings in your portfolio that are acting well and maintaining good uptrends can be held. Yet earnings season is likely to raise volatility. And investors need to pay extra attention to those stocks that [undercut the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).



On Wednesday, July 2021 IPO **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) deserved such attention. The language-learning app slumped 4.2% to 201.58. Volume climbed 43% above its 50-day moving average. Yet most important, DUOL closed beneath the 50-day line for the first time in nearly 11 weeks.


Dramatic declines through the 50-day moving average, or the [10-week line on the weekly chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/), often signal the time to take profits and guard against a complete round trip of paper gains.


Another sell signal delivered by Duolingo? The midcap stock market leader sold off from Dec. 28 to Jan. 5, losing nearly 14% in the process. Shares rebounded for three days in a row. But the gains were small, and turnover proved timid. A sharp decline in heavy volume followed by a weak rebound in lighter turnover also serves as a timely sell signal.

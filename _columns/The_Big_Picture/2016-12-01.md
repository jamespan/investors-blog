U.S. stock indexes on Thursday played a game of who to believe, as the Nasdaq plunged further south while blue chips and small caps stayed calm.


The Nasdaq wielded an ax en route to a 1.4% loss while the S&P 500 pruned 0.4%. The small-cap S&P 600 also lost 0.4%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%. Volume in the stock market today was up on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE.


For the fourth session in a row, the action slapped the market with stalling or [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) — both signs of institutional selling. The cluster of distribution shifted the market's condition from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure. The Nasdaq's distribution-day count remained at nine as the Oct. 26 distribution day fell off the count. After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions.


![mp120116b](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP120116b-148x300.png)The stock market has its own ideas about what is relevant, and tech is not it. The Philadelphia semiconductor index careened 4.9% lower. Since Election Day, the SOX has gained only 1%, the same as the Nasdaq. The small-cap S&P 600 and the Dow have advanced 11% and 5%.


Trump-benefiting stock groups are holding up better than the general market. The heavy construction group gained 0.6% on a tough day and now is up 22% since the election, according to preliminary data. The superregional banks group rose 2% and is now up 21% in the same period.


A radical difference in direction or magnitude for the indexes, though, is nothing to cheer about. At the very least, the action creates uncertainty. The ideal market is a tide that lifts all boats. These waters are punching some holes in the boat.


Consider the IBD 50's performance Thursday: 13 stocks lost 4% or more for the day, many in heavy volume and mainly chip stocks; 11 rose 2% or more, but mostly in below-average volume and predominantly financials.


With risk increasing in the market, investors need to watch their holdings more closely. Taking some profits would be a good step. Cutting losses at 7% or 8% is crucial, and in some cases selling at even smaller losses would be smart. Small caps led the market's strong November, so that area is worth watching for opportunities after the market gets back on its feet.


In economic news, reports were mostly positive. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 26,936 planned layoffs, the slowest pace of 2016. Two manufacturing indexes — the Purchasing Managers Index and the Institute of Supply Management — came in stronger than expected.


Construction spending in October showed 0.5% growth vs. the 0.6% expected. However, the previous month's figure was revised from -0.4% to flat.


First-time jobless claims were more than expected: 268,000 vs. estimates for 253,000.


U.S. motor vehicle sales for November reached 17.9 million, edging above the consensus estimate for 17.8 million, according to Econoday. Some analysts worry that discounts are the only thing keeping the sales at the current level.


On Friday before the stock market's open, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release employment data for November. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to come in at 170,000. The estimates range from 230,000 on the optimistic side to 150,000 on the pessimistic side. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged from 4.9%.

The major indexes pared losses Tuesday as the market looked for signs that sellers have exhausted themselves.


In an erratic session, the Nasdaq was as high as 1.1% and as low as 1.4% before closing 0.3% lower. The S&P 500 displayed similar behavior and edged down less than 0.1%. Volume fell across the board.


Repeating a familiar occurrence, the energy sector was market's weakest after crude oil prices skidded nearly 5%. **Anadarko Petroleum** ([APC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APC)) slashed its dividend by 81% to conserve cash. Other oil companies have cut their dividend or cut capital-spending plans to cope with the industry's woes.

But transportation stocks, which stand to benefit from cheaper fuel prices, climbed. The Dow transportation average rallied 1%.


IBD's airline, railroad and trucking industry groups rose 1% to nearly 3%. Those were among a smattering of groups -- mainly from the lower rankings -- that climbed 1% or more.


With the indexes trending downward, there are few signs of a bottoming process so far.


For the second day in a row, the market fought back from steep declines. Those bounces came as the put/call volume ratio spiked this week to levels that indicate unusually high fear among investors.


In the past many months, such spikes have marked lows in the indexes, and that should give some encouragement. However, the previous four times the put/call ratio spiked, dating back to November, the market rebounds that followed were modest and short-lived. That trend can be observed in the put/call ratio graph, plotted below the S&P 500 chart on Page B4.


To be sure, the market has plenty to be concerned about these days.


The S&P 500 companies are on track to post their first back-to-back quarters of declining earnings since 2007-08. That's what's known as an [earnings recession](https://www.investors.com/news/dollar-pounds-q4-earnings-into-recession-territory/).


Speaking of recession, some economists are spotting signs of a U.S. contraction. A drop in Treasury yields and the long slide in oil and copper prices seem to support those fears. Many global economies already are in weak condition.


Geopolitical problems are adding to the angst, including terrorism and brushes with China and Russia.


More than 3,100 stocks have Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of D or E, while 1,660 hold a favorable rating of A or B. Such massive institutional selling is a sign that a major washout is unfolding.


The IBD 50 fell 0.5% Tuesday, though it could have been a smaller loss had it not been for **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)).


The aircraft components maker missed profit and sales expectations, sending shares plummeting 13% in the highest volume of its yearslong run. That's a sell signal for the stock and just the latest in a series of severe sell-offs afflicting growth stocks.


Strong orders for new passenger jets with better fuel efficiency sparked companies such as TransDigm and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). But the industry is trending downward, part of a sector rotation that has brought defensive stocks such as utilities, tobacco, gold stocks as the new leadership for now.

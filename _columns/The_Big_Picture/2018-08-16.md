U.S. stock indexes loped ahead Thursday as the market found hope on separate trade issues involving China and Turkey.




The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 1.6%, while the large-cap S&P 500 and the small-cap S&P 600 added 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. The Nasdaq trailed with a 0.4% gain.


Volume in the stock market fell on both major exchanges. It was a disappointing note on an up day, although it followed a trading spike Wednesday.


Tariff worries receded as China said it had accepted a U.S. invitation to come to Washington for trade talks later this month.

Late Wednesday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey officials were ready to talk to the U.S. provided there is "no threatening, no dictating."


Despite recent news coverage that has focused more on Turkey, China is arguably the bigger concern.


China's share of the world's GDP is 19.7%, according to World Bank data. Turkey accounts for less than 1.4% of world GDP. The U.S. comes in at 31.2%.


Thursday's rally was broadly based. In the S&P 500, advancing issues led declining issues by an almost 6-1 ratio, according to data from IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co. Industry groups rising led those falling by a 7-1 ratio.


**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) delivered the day's biggest upside surprise. The stock surged 9% in red-hot volume.Â The company reported that [earnings jumped 46%](https://www.investors.com/news/walmart-earnings-report-walmart-stock/), the most in at least 20 quarters. The Street's consensus estimate was for a 13% gain. Same-store sales increased 4.5%, almost double the expectation for 2.4%.

Other blue chips doing well included **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), up 4.5%; **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), up 4%; and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), up 3%. [Cisco beat views late Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-csco-stock-earnings-beat-estimates/) and gave a favorable outlook.


Are any of the blue chips in the Dow near buy points? Here are four:


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) has sketched a nearly 25-week consolidation. It's a flat base with a 119.43 buy point. The Street expects earnings to jump 34% in 2018. If so, that would be the biggest gain in eight years.


**Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) recently added a handle to a cup pattern. The buy point is 46.97. Analysts expect earnings to grow 9% this year. A 9% pop would be the best annual gain in seven years.


**United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)) has shaped a cup-with-handle pattern with a 136.76 entry. The Street estimates earnings will grow 9% this year, the highest in five years. The diversified company's products include aircraft engines and elevators.


Cisco climbed close to the 46.47 buy point of a flat base. The base also could be interpreted as a double bottom, although it's a shallower pattern than most double bottoms. Analysts see 12% earnings growth this year, which would be the best in seven years.


However, leading stocks had a relatively weak performance. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed only 0.1%, well behind the major indexes. A dozen IBD 50 stocks rose 2% or more, but sharp declines in others helped offset those gains. The main drag was **Nanometrics** ([NANO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NANO)), which plunged nearly 9% on an analyst downgrade.


Economic Data
-------------


Housing starts for July missed badly. The Street expected 1.271 million. The figure came in at 1.168 million, below the lowest estimate in the range. Homebuilder stocks as a group are trading 27% off the high.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 212,000, below the consensus estimate of 215,000.


The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook for August missed wildly. Analysts expected a reading of 22.5. The number came in at 11.9, a 21-month low.

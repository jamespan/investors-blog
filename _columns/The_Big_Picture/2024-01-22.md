The Dow Jones Industrial Average made another record high Monday, closing above the 38,000 level for the first time, while small caps led the stock market.




The major indexes gapped up at the open, but whittled down some gains.


Bulls appeared emboldened as the 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 4.09%. The 10-year yield, however, bounced off its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). It has now spent five sessions above the 4% level as Fed officials and some economists tamp down expectations of multiple rate cuts this year.


The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3% to its highest level in two years. The Nasdaq 100 made another record high before paring gains.


Indexes closed in the lower rungs of the day's price ranges. It's not ideal when buyers disappear late in the day. The Dow added 0.4% and the S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher, but both had been up as much as 0.6%.


Stock Market Gets Distribution Day
----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP012224_3-192x300.jpg)Coupled with slightly higher volume on the New York Stock Exchange, the S&P 500 added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). That's the sixth day of heavy volume losses on the index, which is a red flag for the stock market.


While index gains were moderate, some market internals indicated underlying strength.


Advancing stocks topped decliners by a [7-to-3 ratio on the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/daily-market-statistics) exchange and by better than 3-to-1 on the NYSE. That's a welcome breadth reading, as the NYSE and Nasdaq try to break a three-week downtrend in their advance-decline lines.


Eight of the 11 S&P sector indexes rose on the stock market, while consumer discretionary, consumer staples and utilities fell roughly 0.5%.


The [up-down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-under-accumulation-use-the-up-down-volume-ratio-to-find-the-best-prospects/) of Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) and SPDR S&P 500 Trust ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) are at a bullish 1.8 and 1.6, respectively.


Small Caps Act As Stock Market Gauge
------------------------------------


Small caps led the stock market with a 2% jump in the Russell 2000. The small-cap index started the year with a 5.6% plunge, until it found support at its 1,900 level. It's been rebounding since then, up three days in a row.



While only 47 companies in the Russell 2000 have reported fourth-quarter earnings through Thursday, the initial trend is favorable. According to the London Stock Exchange Group, 72.3% have reported above analyst expectations and 23.4% have missed estimates. Over the past four quarters, 60% of companies beat estimates and 34% missed views.


Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, says the participation of the Russell 2000 in the market's advance shows it isn't just big techs rising. Small caps including financials, biotechnology firms and industrials have joined the rally.


"As technology, semiconductors, and consumer discretionary led the S&P 500 to new highs it reflected the strength of the growth sectors that underpinned the inherent strength in the bull market that was born earlier last year," Krosby noted.


Perhaps the most bullish sign for investors was the several stocks that topped buy points in Monday's stock market.


**ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) and **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) broke out, although not all in heavy volume. **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) climbed above a trendline drawn from its Dec. 14 peak.


China, Other Foreign Stock Markets Falter
-----------------------------------------


While U.S. stocks are off to a good start in 2024, major foreign markets are down and sometimes sharply lower.


London, Paris and German exchanges are down 0.4% to 3.2% this month. The Tokyo Nikkei 225 index is down more than 9%.


The China stock market continues to melt. The iShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) is down more than 11% this month, trading near all-time lows.


The Shanghai Composite Index sold off 2.7% Monday, its largest drop since April 25, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It's down more than 7% this month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.3% Monday, and is off 12.2% this year so far. China's property assets remain a worry for investors.


Among U.S.-traded Chinese stocks, electric-car maker **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) is down 34% in January, extending a three-year downtrend.


**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) narrowly avoided its lowest close since Nov. 29, 2022. It ended down nearly 3% at 99.72. **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) is down more than 25% year to date.

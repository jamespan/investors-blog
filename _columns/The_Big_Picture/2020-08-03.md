With a record high in the Nasdaq composite, Monday's stock market took a positive step as it tried to resolve a period of unclear direction.




Indexes opened solidly higher and maintained altitude for nearly the entire session. Gapping up at the open, the Nasdaq topped the prior record high at 10,839. It reached a new high of 10,927.


To use a refrain of the new bull market, strength in technology stocks helped the Nasdaq outperform. The index, about 50% stacked with technology companies, climbed 1.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.7% and is now at the highest level since Feb. 21, poised to erase all losses from the coronavirus bear market. The Russell 2000 jumped 1.8%.


Among exchange traded funds, Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) burst 2.5% higher. It wasn't just technology propelling the stock market. Growth and small caps shined in a broad advance. The iShares Russell 1000 ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) jumped 1.3%.


![MP080320](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MP080320-220x300.jpg)Rising stocks led decliners by 7-to-4 on the NYSE and by 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE. Ideally, market gains, especially new highs, are more credible when they occur in higher volume.


Friday's Big Picture asked readers to watch for [four events this week that could influence the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/techs-lead-stock-market-apple-amazon-rally-four-signs-to-watch/). One of them was the horizontal formations the Nasdaq and S&P 500 shaped for the past few weeks. Monday's gains took both indexes above those formations, marking a positive shift. Now, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are tasked with extending gains from their short-term consolidations.


There are some reasons to support that. Earnings season has been mainly positive in terms of market reaction. Each week, there's progress on Covid-19 vaccines or treatments. On Monday, **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) said it's [starting late-stage trials](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lilly-stock-jumps-coronavirus-drug-enters-phase-3-testing/) of a drug that may prevent spread in nursing homes.


Top growth stocks exhibit few problems. The IBD 50 climbed 2.2%, and its tracking Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ascended to the highest price since October 2018. There was still no deal on a new coronavirus aid bill, but investors shrugged.


Tech, Retail, Health Care Higher
--------------------------------


Retail, telecom and health care also performed well. Two of Monday's most notable breakouts came from retail.


**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) broke out past a 126.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But volume was light. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remains limp, reflecting Target's sideways trend since mid-May, a period when the major indexes have been rising.


Pet products provider **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) jumped out of a six-week base in heavy volume. Shares closed extended from the 52.87 buy point. The relative strength line made new highs also, a bullish sign.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) led the Dow with a 5.6% vault, almost making a record high. Microsoft confirmed it [wants to buy the U.S. business of video website TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/microsoft-confirms-talks-to-buy-tiktok-in-us.html) from Chinese owner ByteDance. Privacy issues have dogged TikTok. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that TikTok and **Tencent**'s ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) WeChat provide user data "directly to the Chinese Communist Party." President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, although Reuters reported he will grant time for Microsoft to strike a deal that keeps user data in the U.S.


It's not all sunny skies for the stock market, though. Consumer stocks were lower Monday, and those are a key linchpin in the economy's recovery. Financials also have been lagging.


The S&P 500 is carrying five [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), which is a heavy load. But the Nasdaq has only two, after the July 13 distribution day was removed. The index climbed more than 5% from that day's close, rendering it irrelevant for current conditions.

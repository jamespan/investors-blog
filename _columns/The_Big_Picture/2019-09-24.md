A decent start [in stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) turned ugly fast. Plus, a bad close for key indexes served as another key reminder of the higher-than-typical volatility hitting the market lately.




The stock market uptrend, confirmed by a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/) by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Aug. 13, is back under pressure. The last time the outlook turned to "under pressure" was on Aug. 14, just one day after the latest rally confirmation. It remained in that uncertain status for about three weeks, until the market started rising again.


The Nasdaq composite led Tuesday's drop with a 1.4% shellacking. Up nearly 0.6% in the first 25 minutes of trade, the tech-centered index quickly turned tail following a sharp drop in the [consumer confidence index](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for September by the Conference Board.


President Donald Trump grabbed the headlines too, on two fronts. First came Trump's speech to the U.N. General Assembly that largely slammed China's trade and business practices. Next, the rival Democratic Party signaled it would initiate impeachment proceedings within the House of Representatives.


It appeared that both pieces of news greased the market's slide, sending all key indexes into the red. After the market close, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced that she would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.8% as a rally in utility, gold and some retail shares blunted the large-cap index's decline. Small caps got hurt more. The Russell 2000 sank 1.6%.


Big Funds Distribute Stocks
---------------------------


Volume grew sharply on both exchanges.


The [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count expanded to four on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Keep in mind that Friday's sell-off in higher turnover got muddled by the hyperactive trading that often happens as weekly and monthly stock and index options expire.


While many leading stocks are having trouble making headway following their latest breakouts, some stocks that peaked this summer are still grinding lower, leaving market watchers wondering when names such as **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and e-commerce platform **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) will bottom out.


Plus, the Nasdaq sliced below its 50-day moving average and closed below it for the first time in nearly three weeks. In a healthy market uptrend, expect the major equity indexes to rise nicely above their 50-day lines. That would mean a rally is accelerating in pace.


That sure hasn't been the case lately.


Stocks Today: Is The Bear Growling Again?
-----------------------------------------


At 7993, the Nasdaq composite is essentially where it began at the start of the third quarter. The two most recent corrections that carried any real significance for growth investors were far milder than the 23.6% bruising suffered in the fourth quarter of 2018.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MP092419-226x300.jpg)If the stock market can forecast the U.S. economy six or 12 months out, then right now neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 is relaying a recession. The latter, ending at 2966, still trades above its 50-day line and stands just 2% below its all-time peak of 3027.


"The key to the economy and the financial markets is in the wallets of the consumer," Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird, wrote in a Monday note to clients. "The largest threat to the markets is the negative effects of the ongoing trade war (spilling into the manufacturing sector) and weak global growth, which could slow the trajectories of corporate profits and cut into business and consumer confidence."


Small-cap indexes, for sure, trade much further below their highs.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.6% and continues to wrestle with its long-term 200-day moving average. At 32.60, The IBD 50-tracking ETF is still up nicely for the year at 18%, but has now fallen nearly 10% below its near-term peak.


Yields on long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds are falling rapidly again. The benchmark 10-year note's yield plunged eight basis points to 1.64%. That's still above 1.6% for two-year notes. But the 10-year yield also stands more than a full percentage point below the 2.66% registered on Jan. 2.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) has not made any true progress since it trotted past a 117.34 buy point in a cup without handle on Sept. 12. Other fellow money center banks such as **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) are trying not to let handles on their cup bases turn into simply another leg down in price.


The Silver Lining
-----------------


Back when the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton started on Oct. 8, 1998, the market was already in bear-market territory. Later that month, the indexes staged a big follow-through, initiating a new rally that ultimately led to the blow-off market top in March 2000. Dot-com stocks went bust. Remember Pets.com?


Today, numerous unicorns have not performed that great, either.


WeWork is delaying its IPO. **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) and **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) both trade well below their IPO prices. Today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)), came close to a [new breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) before its rally on Tuesday petered out.


Still, it's a great time to stay focused on leading stocks and keeping your watch list up to date.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) lost a couple of names due to the intense selling of the session. Yet it still has more than a dozen names on two key lists.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is reflecting rising demand for income-producing REITs. But the list is still evolving. Consumer spending, financial services, retail, payment processing and China themes define the list nowadays.


[Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) has shrunk dramatically in recent months as enterprise software stocks took a well needed rest. So has the [IPO Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).

The stock market closed mainly lower Friday as the bears continued to reign supreme. Now the latest Federal Reserve meeting and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) earnings are among the highlights looming in the week ahead.




The Nasdaq composite fared best out of the major indexes as it rose 0.4%, but it suffered a stout weekly decline of 2.6%. The tech-heavy index was turned away at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) and now sits firmly below the 13,000 level. Its 2023 gains have atrophied, leaving the Nasdaq up less than 22% for the year.


The S&P 500 lost more ground as it dipped 0.5% for the day and 2.5% for the week. It lost more ground on its 200-day line and sits at levels not seen since May. The benchmark index has fallen around 10% from July highs and is now up less than 8% for 2023.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the toughest time out of the major indexes on the stock market as it fell 1.1%. The 50-day line could soon fall below the 200-day moving average, which would be a bearish indicator. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was by far the brightest Dow component as it [surged on earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-rises-as-chipmaker-beats-q3-targets/). **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) were the worst laggards.


Small caps fell to levels last seen in November 2020 after the Russell 2000 dropped 1.2%. Growth stocks absorbed the worst beatdown by the bears, though, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) tumbled 1.5%.


Fed Meeting And Apple Earnings Loom
-----------------------------------


The stock market initially responded positively after the core Personal Consumption Expenditure index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation which strips out food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in September. This matched estimates. The core 12-month inflation rate eased to 3.7% from 3.8% in August.


All eyes will now turn to the latest Fed meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee meets Wednesday and Thursday. It is almost certain rates will be held steady but the post-meeting comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on future policy could move the market.


A key consideration for central bankers is the labor market, and some key data is also due here on this front. Most importantly of all, the October report for U.S. nonfarm payrolls is set to drop Friday.


Meanwhile, a number of earnings reports are also looming large. Apple earnings are due Thursday while the likes of **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) also report in the coming week.


Amazon Earnings Boost This Stock Market Sector
----------------------------------------------


A majority of the [S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Consumer discretionary and technology fared the best, boosted by an impressive earnings report from **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). Energy and financials had the toughest sessions.


The relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the action in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Shoe stocks, media periodicals plays, dairy products firms, computer networking companies and restaurants were among the best performers.


In contrast, integrated telecom services stocks, oil-and-gas equipment firms, solar stocks and alcoholic beverage plays were the worst laggards.

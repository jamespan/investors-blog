  Why Monday's Stock Market Gave An Important Signal To Investors

The stock market autumn swoon got worse Monday after indexes undercut key levels on their charts, forcing investors to raise their defenses.




The Nasdaq composite undercut its Nov. 20 low, ending a once-promising rally. The Nasdaq closed 2.3% lower and slid further below 7000, around where support existed in late October and November. The S&P 500 lost 2.1% and tumbled below 2600, a floor that had held in the past.


With indexes falling below prior lows, IBD cut its outlook to "market in correction." This signals investors to move into cash as much as possible and as soon as possible.


Reduce exposure by taking some profits. Most important, avoid buying stocks and [sell any holding that falls 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below the purchase price. Hold only the few stocks that are still outperforming and deserving of your confidence.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MP121718-291x300.jpg)Left dazed by weeks of selling and [false starts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/), investors must now be patient and wait for the broad market to find a bottom.


With the main indexes already down more than 10% from their highs, many investors already considered the market to be in a correction. Monday's signals confirmed that. Any Santa Claus rally seems unlikely at this point.


One broad class of equities is already in a bear market. The Russell 2000 fell 2.3% and is more than 20% below its prior high.


The severe selling Monday spared few stocks. Losers topped winners by about 13-to-2 on the NYSE and by a more than 4-1 margin on the Nasdaq. Volume rose, a confirmation that institutions sold heavily.


Even sectors that provided some shelter this fall were of no help Monday. The Dow utilities average plunged 3.4%. Real estate investment trusts were rocked as the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF ([RWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RWR)) plummeted 3.7%.


More Uncertainty For Stock Market
---------------------------------


Wall Street is bracing for a week of uncertainty, only adding to its angst.


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy on interest rates. Odds remain high, at just over 72% through Monday, for another quarter-point rate hike, but there's [more uncertainty this time](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-fed-rate-hike-no-slam-dunk-dow-jones-sinks/) than in prior times a hike was expected.


The faltering stock market is making a rate hike this month far from certain. Regardless of the Fed's decision, investors are eager to see if the central bank does indeed take a dovish stance. The Fed seemed to do that Nov. 28, when Chairman Jerome Powell said rates are just below normal.


In Washington, President Donald Trump is threatening to shut down federal offices unless funding is provided to build a border wall. Democrats are set against it, setting up a showdown.


The market opened Monday with news that unsettled the health care sector. A [federal judge on Friday struck down ObamaCare as unconstitutional](https://www.investors.com/news/obamacare-ruling-hospital-stocks-medicaid-insurer-stocks/). A case as important as this never gets settled in the lower courts, so Wall Street will now wait for appeals to run their course. Eventually, the Supreme Court could make a new ruling on the law. It may also cause lawmakers to adjust the law.


In Monday's broad sell-off, the medical sector was in the middle of sector performance. Health insurance, outpatient care, drug wholesale, medical products, and hospitals declined 2% to 3.5%.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), the nation's largest provider of health coverage, fell deeper below its 50-day moving average.

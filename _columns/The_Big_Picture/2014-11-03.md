Stocks closed narrowly mixed Monday, but many leaders showed better action.


The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, thanks to strength in data storage and networking stocks. But it was up as much as 0.5% intraday, to another 14-1/2-year high.


Monday marked the index's first close in the bottom half of its trading range in eight sessions â€” a small sign of slack after a torrid advance.


The S&P 500 reversed mildly from an all-time high, ending fractionally lower.


Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 just had two weeks of solid gains. They have gone sharply higher since hitting six-month lows Oct. 15. So, some kind of a pullback or consolidation can be expected at this point.


Elsewhere, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1% and the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The IBD 50 rose 0.2%, in line with the Nasdaq.


Monday marked the first trading session on November, which is typically a bullish month. In the past 20 years, stocks have been up 14 times in November.


Volume Monday dropped sharply from Friday's fast pace on both major exchanges. Declining issues edged winners on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Despite a lackluster performance in the main indexes, leading stocks continued to show strength. Another round of top-rated stocks staged breakouts.


**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) cleared a 232.38 buy point from a base within a larger pattern in solid volume. The stock had already surged 13% Friday on strong earnings.


**Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)), **Quintiles Transnational** ([Q](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=Q)), **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)) and **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) also came out of bases. (See the New Highs on Page B1 for more coverage on breakouts.) **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) broke out too, but it reversed lower.


For the most part, stocks that have broken out recently are doing well. **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) recently triggered the eight-week hold rule past a 90.60 buy point.


Others such as **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) and **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) are up in double-digits from their respective buy points of 39.58 and 31.76 . Even **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), which is typically a slower mover, is up 11% past a 158.73 entry from a flat base.


This week brings a smaller but significant batch of corporate earnings reports. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) will report before Tuesday's open. The stock jumped in busy trade Monday, regaining a 99.80 buy point from an IPO base.

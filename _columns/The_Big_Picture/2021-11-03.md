The stock market's message, at least on Wednesday? [No taper tantrum](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-taper-starts-sees-transitory-inflation-dow-jones/).




Stocks of many stripes rallied, long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds fell only modestly, [current stock market leaders](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) mostly showed bullish movement, and Wall Street brushed off a sell-off in crude oil. Why? Wall Street focused completely on the Federal Reserve, which delivered what many thought to be a reasonable [start to gradually reducing $120 billion worth of monthly buys](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-taper-starts-sees-transitory-inflation-dow-jones/) of Treasury and mortgage-backed agency debt securities.


That "quantitative easing" program has served to keep the cost of borrowing money extra low. It succeeded. And now, the Fed thinks the economic recovery is strong enough to justify slowly taking that generous monetary policy away. It also believes the current jump in inflation is not permanent.


Later this month, the Fed will cut the monthly pace of net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasuries and $5 billion for mortgage securities. Yet the central U.S. bank made it clear in a statement issued after the 2 p.m. ET announcement that it is "prepared to adjust the pace of net asset purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook."


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP110321-175x300.jpg)"This isn't the Fed's first rodeo when in comes to tapering. Years after the 2008/2009 financial crisis, the Fed began winding down the active expansion of its balance sheet, beginning in mid-December of 2013 and ending in late October of 2014," Jason Pride, CIO of private wealth at Glenmede, wrote in an email to IBD. "Most major asset classes posted positive gains over that period, with global real estate leading the pack with a 14% total return."


For that calculation, Pride cites the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index, which measures the stock performance of real estate firms in the North American, European and Asian real estate markets.


Bond Prices Dip A Bit
---------------------


The yield on the key 10-year bond edged up to 1.58%, recouping Tuesday's 2-basis-point drop, Cboe data showed. In other words, no mass rush for the exits in long-dated Treasury bonds for now.


Following the Fed news, major indexes stepped on the gas. The Nasdaq composite's 1% gain surpassed a nearly 0.7% rise by the S&P 500. But it couldn't surpass a 1.8% jump by the Russell 2000. Midcap stocks roared higher again, hitting fresh all-time highs for a third straight session.


The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund rallied 1.1% on Wednesday, expanding its current advance to 5.1% over the past five sessions.


Volume grew on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. Stock market breadth also expanded bullishly. [On MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the number of issues gaining in heavy volume topped decliners by nearly 4-to-1. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line likely hit its highest level in eight weeks.

Stock Market Today: Intense Fluctuation Since September
-------------------------------------------------------


Eight weeks ago, IBD's outlook for stocks stood at "market in confirmed uptrend." That changed quickly. By Sept. 17, the Nasdaq amassed four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). This included a session in which [quadruple witching of expiring stock and index futures and options](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/options-expiration-witching-days-do-they-place-the-market-under-a-spell-or-not/) on Sept. 17 saw a real impact in volume that session. Nonetheless, the weakness among many growth stocks at the time and the fading strength of major indexes gave enough evidence to downgrade the outlook that day to "uptrend under pressure."


Nine sessions later, more heavy institutional selling smothered the market, and on Sept. 30, the outlook got a downgrade again, to "market in correction." But a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Oct. 14 on the Nasdaq indicated that a new tradable rally was in fact underway.


No doubt, [not every follow-through works](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). But IBD has discovered that over a century's amount of major stock market bottoms, all of them contained such a key session.

Stock Market Leaders
--------------------


Ultimately, the follow-through day nearly three weeks ago offered the timeliest signal for individual investors to actively deploy capital back into [breakout stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Of course, it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision. Gradual buys of carefully chosen companies that meet [CAN SLIM criteria](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/) is sound portfolio management.


No fewer than 16 companies in [the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), or nearly a third, currently show a weekly gain of 4% or more.


Yet as earnings season has shown, a stock is one day away from becoming a princess or a pauper.



One princess lately: Check out **ArcBest** ([ARCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCB)). The less-than-truckload trucking firm has vaulted as much as 22% since it rushed past a 91.43 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on Thursday. Investors applauded its Monday report of 112% earnings growth in Q3 to $2.59 a share on a 28% sales jump to $1.02 billion.


**Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)), however, surrendered four weeks of nice gains on Wednesday, plunging 19% in the heaviest turnover in two months. The smartphone content firm posted extraordinary results (EPS up 193%, revenue up 338% vs. year-ago levels). But apparently that kind of growth was not big enough. Shares have now fallen 10% below an 80.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [large double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/). APPS also fell below a 76.70 handle entry in that pattern.



Digital Turbine's drop affirmed the importance of buying right.


Monitor This Nasdaq Stat
------------------------



With the [Nasdaq composite](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily) now having rallied in 14 of the past 16 sessions, IBD readers would be wise to expect some type of pullback in the near term.


At 15,811, the Nasdaq closed 5.3% above its again-rising 50-day moving average.


On Feb. 16, the composite got as high as 8% above its 50-day line at the time before finishing lower that day. That reversal helped set the stage for a 12.5% walloping in just three weeks as the Nasdaq ceded market leadership to cyclical sectors.

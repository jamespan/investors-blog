The stock market closed the truncated Thanksgiving holiday week mixed as many traders took the day off to digest their turkey dinners. But it was another constructive week ahead of some potential catalysts.




Once again it was blue chip stocks that showed the most impressive action. In a session that ended at 1 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a solid gain of 0.5% and ended the week up 1.8%. It is trading above all its moving averages and is now down just over 6% for the year.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) excelled while **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) lagged amid unrest at the factory of key supplier Foxconn in China.


The S&P 500 ended the day virtually flat Friday, though it was nominally negative. It lifted 1.5% for the week. The [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) remains a resistance area to watch as the index itself moves higher.


The Nasdaq was the worst performer as it ceded 0.5%. Its weekly gain of 0.7% was not particularly impressive either, especially as the index remains down about 28% for the year.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index turned in a minor 0.3% gain, while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed nearly flat.


Volume was down on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE when compared with 1 p.m. on Wednesday. Advancers outnumbered decliners nearly 2-1 on the NYSE but held a slimmer edge on the Nasdaq.


Powell Speech Among Possible Catalysts
--------------------------------------


There are a number of events coming up in the week that could help or hinder stocks.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MP112822-274x300.jpg)All eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell when he gives a speech Wednesday at the Brookings Institution. The latest Fed minutes showed central bankers see slower rate hikes coming "soon," so look for more details on this.


November's jobs report, due Friday, is another key data point. According to Refinitiv, economists expect an additional 200,000 jobs in the month of November. This would be down from 261,000 in October. If this comes in softer than expected it could give stocks a big boost, as the Fed is keen to see a slowdown in the red-hot jobs market.


The personal consumption expenditures index is due Thursday. The PCE deflator is worth watching here as Fed officials see it as a key inflation metric.

These Areas Shine Amid Mixed Stock Market Action
------------------------------------------------


The performance of the industry groups Friday reflected the uncertain action, with notable variety at both ends of the performance spectrum.


Dairy product stocks, leisure services plays, shipping transportation companies, diversified conglomerates and hospitals were among the best performers.


On the downside, metal miners, the movies group, which is led by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), computer game makers and oil & gas drillers all lagged.


China stocks also struggled amid ongoing Covid issues in the communist country. E-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and EV maker **Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) all fell by 3% or more.

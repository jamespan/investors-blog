Stocks chalked up another nondescript day Thursday, as trade stayed below average for an eighth session in a row.


The Nasdaq lost 0.1%, and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average echoed the loss. The S&P 500 was flat.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Banks, the postelection rally's leading sector, ran into some light profit-taking. PowerShares KBW Bank ([KBWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBWB)), an exchange traded fund comprised of two dozen banks, dropped 1.1%. The ETF is about 3% off its recent high.


![MP122916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP122916-215x300.png)KBW Bank is still 24% above its October breakout. The two banks in the Dow also ran into light selling.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) fell almost 1%, but volume was running about 20% below average. The stock is about 1% off its high and 32% above its August breakout.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) sliced off 1% in trade about 35% slower than usual. After hitting a high in mid-December, Goldman is now about 3% off that high. The stock is extended but has completed a three-weeks-tight pattern. The potential buy point is 245.67.


The three-weeks-tight pattern can only be seen on a weekly chart. It involves three weekly closes bunched tightly. A move above the pattern's high, preferably in heavy volume, constitutes a secondary buy zone.


Individual investors who got left behind by the fast moves in the bank sector could use the three-weeks-tight as a way to gain exposure. However, because the three-weeks-tight is a secondary entry, new positions should be lighter than usual.


Besides Goldman, Chicago-based **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)) has sketched a three-weeks-tight pattern. The potential buy point is 91.06.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *If investors want to [win in 2017](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-trump-revive-reagans-stock-market-magic/), they should keep a laserlike focus on this item.*

The day's winners had a junky composition. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gold miners popped 5%. But the gold group is dead last in the ratings.


Other groups leading for the day included food and dairy producers; food wholesalers; and utilities. All are market laggards.


Meanwhile, the market served a slice of humble pie to some of the highly rated groups. Coal, metals and superregional banks suffered the day's sharpest losses. All are top 40 groups.


On Friday, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index will report results for December about 45 minutes after the open. The Street's consensus target is 57. The range of estimates runs from 56 to 58.6. Readings above 50 point to expansion. The Chicago survey includes both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms.


In the afternoon, the Baker Hughes oil and natural gas rig count will be released.

The stock market tried to make a stand in the face of a hot inflation report, but negative sentiment ultimately won the day. Meanwhile, bears have overpowered the bulls in a key contrarian sentiment gauge.




Indexes started off strong and managed to hold in the green for much of the day. But the temporary respite was used as a tactical selling opportunity, causing a painful reversal into the close.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day down 3.2%. It is continuing to waterfall on its daily and weekly charts, sitting about 13% below its 50-day moving average.


The broader S&P 500 also took its licks, falling 1.6%. While it also sits below its 50-day line, its decline has not been as dramatic. The index is down 13.1% since the end of March, vs. 20.1% for the Nasdaq.


[The S&P sectors closed mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), with energy and utilities the biggest winners. But losses in technology and consumer discretionary, which were the worst sectors by far, outstripped the gains.

Small Caps, Growth Hit Amid Stock Market Woes
---------------------------------------------


Smaller companies are more at risk in a potential recessionary environment, and this is reflected in the performance of small caps Wednesday.


They were once again pounded by the grumpy bears, with the Russell 2000 ending the day down 2.5%.


The index is lagging both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 so far in 2022, giving up more than 23%.


Growth stocks had a bad day, too, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) down 1.4%. It is now down an eye-watering 36% for the year.


Inflation Runs Hot But Note This Silver Lining
----------------------------------------------


Investors had hoped that April's consumer price index (CPI) would be the one that showed inflation had crested. It didn't.


It rose at an annual pace of 8.3%, down vs. the previous month's 8.5%, but higher than economists projected.


After an initial jolt back above 3%, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note closed the day down about 7 basis points at 2.93%.


Some analysts fear the inflation report could cause the Federal Reserve to consider a 0.75% interest-rate hike, but those fears may be overdone.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told Investor's Business Daily that the base case remains intact for the Fed's much vaunted "softish" landing. This equates to a shallow, rather than a deep, market recession.


"Despite another hot inflation report, promising signs are emerging that pricing pressures should ease over the next few months," he said. "Stocks are breaking through some key technical levels, so one major plunge might be needed to trigger investors that remain heavy with cash."


These Groups Flex Muscles Despite Turmoil
-----------------------------------------


Even when markets are struggling, it is vital that investors keep track of the strongest and weakest industry groups.



On Wednesday it was coal stocks, tobacco plays and a variety of oil and gas groups that turned in the best gains. In addition, a powerful 8% gain for **Electronic Arts** ([EA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EA)) helped the video gaming group shine. EA motored higher despite, or perhaps because, it announced it was ending its long-running partnership with FIFA to make licensed soccer games.


Analysts believe the firm's strong balance sheet and free cash flow will help it through tough times ahead. MoffettNathanson analyst Clay Griffin, who rates the stock as a buy, also believes the "EA Sports FC" game will be able to succeed without the FIFA license. EA also [announced new game titles](https://www.barrons.com/articles/electronic-arts-stock-price-earnings-51652205677?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D41634994139940988431829159716067847337%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1652306200).


On the downside, solar stocks, consumer electronics retailers and auto manufacturers were among the worst performers. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), long a growth winner, hurt the latter group as it plunged over 8%.

Bears Reign Supreme In Key Gauge
--------------------------------


The latest advisors sentiment weekly report from [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) offers a ray of hope to investors looking for a bottom just around the corner.


The bull-bear spread widened to -13.2%, from -8.4% at the previous count. There have been more bears than bulls for six of the last 10 weeks, with the current spread the largest during that period.


The bears roared higher to 40.8% of investors, their highest percentage since March 2020. Meanwhile, the bulls tumbled to 27.6%, below their prior 2022 low of 29.9%.


Remember, this is a contrarian indicator. The fact sentiment is so negative suggests a rally could be set to take place. Nevertheless, there may be more pain to come before a relief rebound occurs.


As ever, investors should let the day-to-day action of the indexes and performance of the current stock market leaders act as their principal guide.

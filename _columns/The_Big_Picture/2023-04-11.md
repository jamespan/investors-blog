Major stock indexes were on pace for their third straight close near session highs Tuesday. But sellers came into the stock market during the final half hour of trading as Wall Street grew jittery ahead of a key inflation report early Wednesday.




The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) was the best performer, up 0.8%, helped by a bullish breakout for **PriceSmart** ([PSMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSMT)) as well strong percentage gains for **Kura Sushi** ([KRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRUS)) and Bitcoin-related stocks like **Riot Platforms** ([RIOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIOT)) and **Marathon Digital** ([MARA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MARA)).


The Nasdaq pared an early 0.6% loss despite some selling in software stocks. Sentiment was negative after UBS warned that growth estimates for the cloud businesses of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are too high.


GOOGL stock fell for the second straight session after topping a 106.69 entry Thursday. Microsoft also lost ground and could be poised for a test of its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which sits just above the stock's last buy point of 276.86.


In the enterprise software group, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) fell 1.4%. But the group held up well overall, ending mostly flat.

Several top-rated growth stock moved higher in light volume. But not **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)), which gapped above its 200-day moving average in heavy volume. The company completed its acquisition of Neovasc, which makes a product to treat [refractory angina](https://shockwavemedical.com/about/press-releases/shockwave-medical-announces-agreement-to-acquire-neovasc/). Bank of America Securities maintained a buy rating and increased SWAV's price target to 275 from 235.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved above its April 4 high but closed off session highs. The up session came despite weakness in Microsoft and other Dow Jones technology names like SalesforceÂ and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP041123_2.jpg)


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) was the big gainer in the Dow, up 2.3%.


Selling never got intense on the Nasdaq, which closed lower by 0.4%. Breadth watchers liked the fact that winners had a slight edge over losers. But higher volume on the Nasdaq gave the index its second [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


In the semiconductor sector, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Allegro Microsystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) weighed on the fabless group, which fell 0.5%.


The S&P 500 ended flat after rising close to 0.4% intraday. Volume rose on the NYSE, but the S&P 500 avoided a distribution day on the stock market due to its meager decline.


Out of the S&P 500's 11 sectors, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) was the best performer, up nearly 1%. The fund continues to show strength after gapping above its 50-day moving average last week.


The Nasdaq continues to hold above the 12,000 level and the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The S&P 500 is also showing encouraging price action, drifting sideways like the Nasdaq, with no distribution days. An invested percentage in the range of 40% to 60% still makes sense as the Fed continues to fight inflation and first-quarter earnings season approaches.


The Tuesday stock market session served up several strong movers in the building sector. **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) is coming out of a flat base. BLDR broke out of an earlier pattern the week ended March 3. It pulled back to its 10-week moving average, found support, and topped a 90.31 entry Tuesday.


Homebuilders were among the top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com). **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) reclaimed a 117.32 buy point and hit an all-time high. MTH stock joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on March 23.


Several other homebuilders are near entry points, including **Green Brick Partners** ([GRBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRBK)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Taylor Morrison Home** ([TMHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMHC)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)).



**Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) surged out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 47.80 buy point. Volume rose sharply.


Economic Data
-------------


Wall Street will be closely watching inflation data on Wednesday and Thursday. Stock market investors will also keep an eye on retail sales data and a barrage of financial earnings reports Friday from the likes of **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)).


The consumer price index for March, due Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show prices up 5.2% year over year, down from 6% in February. But core prices are expected to be up 5.6%, slightly higher than February's 5.5% reading.

Inflation has generally been cooling, but fear that it could stay elevated has been a headwind for the stock market.


The personal income and spending report released on March 31 showed the core personal consumption expenditures index up 4.6% in February, down from 5.1% in October. But that's still well above the Fed's target of 2%.


As it stands now, the CME FedWatch tool is expecting another quarter-point hike by the Federal Reserve at the May meeting. That would lift the federal funds rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%. For now, stock market traders expect the Fed to stand pat in June with a possible rate cut at the July meeting.

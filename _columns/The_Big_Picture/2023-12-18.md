  Stock Market Keeps Rising; What History Says About The Second Half Of December

As if a seven-week win streak wasn't enough to satiate buyers, the stock market continued its tireless advance Monday. Seasonal trends suggest more gains are in store.




The Nasdaq composite climbed for the eighth session in a row. The S&P 500 also would have made it eight in a row if not for a minuscule loss on Friday. As it is, both indexes are at their highest levels since January 2022 and on a roll heading into the new year.


While advancers and decliners were about even Monday, bigger stocks performed better. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) actually fell nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, MicroSectors FANG+ ([FNGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNGS)), which holds the Magnificent Seven, some of which were once called FANG stocks, jumped 1.6%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed practically flat but remained at record highs. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.6% and is nearing an all-time high.


With the Nasdaq's 0.6% increase, its [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) of Nov. 30 and Dec. 4 were both wiped out. The index climbed more than 5% from the close of those distribution days. That leaves only one distribution day on the S&P 500, a number that adequately reflects the stock market's bullish stance.


Small Caps Meet Resistance
--------------------------


Small caps have outperformed the major indexes since the Oct. 27 stock market low. The Russell 2000 is up more than 21% vs. 15.1% for the S&P and 17.9% for the Nasdaq.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP121823-.jpg)Yet, the small-cap benchmark lagged Monday with a 0.1% loss after falling 0.8% Friday.


The Russell 2000 is meeting resistance around the 2000 level, where sellers made a stand in early February and late July. The broader stock market peaked both those times this year, which means this test of resistance could have implications beyond small caps.


Therein lies the stock market's biggest risk — that it may be too rich for its own good. A pullback would not be surprising at this stage. At the same time, the market is in what is seasonally one of the most bullish times of the year.


Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, says December historically is a strong month for stocks. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has made an average gain of 1.5% and finished the month higher 74% of the time.


An important wrinkle on that statistic: Most of the gains during the month come during the second half, he said in a report Monday. The average gain at the halfway point is only around 0.1%.


"And while the index is clearly outpacing its average December progression this year, other years with strong starts to the month have pointed to strong finishes," Turnquist notes. "In fact, of the six prior years when the S&P 500 had a midmonth gain of at least 3%, the index added another 1.5% in the second half of the month to finish December with an average of 5.8%."


Trading May Slow, But Headlines Lie Ahead
-----------------------------------------


Volume fell from Friday's feverish witching-day levels on the stock market. In fact, Friday's 8.377 billion shares on the Nasdaq were the most this year on the composite.


With the Christmas holiday weekend approaching, trading desks may be quieter than usual. But a few events on the calendar could upend the holiday calm.


On Tuesday, housing data is due out before the market opens, and two Fed officials will give speeches. Homebuilding and other housing-market stocks have been rallying as Treasury yields — and mortgage rates — drop.

The Conference Board's consumer sentiment index comes out Wednesday. Revised third-quarter GDP and the index of leading indicators come out Thursday. Then Friday, the [personal income and spending report](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559388&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) will be watched for the all-important core personal consumption expenditures, which is the Fed's most trusted inflation gauge.


Earnings reports this week from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) could have ripple effects.


IBD ETFs Performance Vs. Stock Market
-------------------------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 0.9% Monday. After lagging much of the year, the ETF is outperforming the major indexes since the October lows, up nearly 20%.


Its cousin fund, the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) is having quite a rebound of its own. It's up more than 15%. Moreover, the Breakout Opportunities ETF is 2% from new highs.


One reason for its resurgence is the fund's design as a receptor of stocks poised for sustained price gains above their most recent resistance level, plus multiple other factors. With dozens of stocks breaking out, the ETF's performance is improving.

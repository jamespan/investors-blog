It was another quiet day of trading in the stock market Tuesday, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite marked fresh closing highs ahead of some key headlines Wednesday.




The minutes from the May 1 Federal Reserve meeting will be released at 2 p.m. ET, while earnings from [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) will be in focus after the close.


Nvidia has been trading near highs and made a record closing high Tuesday while holding just above a 922.20 handle buy point. The stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) is also near highs.


While some would argue that a lot of good news has been priced into Nvidia and a "sell the news" scenario is possible, conviction holders know there's a chance for another blowout quarter and raised outlook from the AI bellwether.


The stock market held up well despite an early earnings sell-off for security software firm **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)). Shares dived 7% at the open after [billings guidance disappointed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palo-alto-stock-palo-alto-earnings-news-q12024/) again, while revenue growth slowed for the third straight quarter. Palo Alto pared losses by the close but still fell 3.7% in huge volume.


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is the outright leader in the security software group at this point. It's less than 5% off its high as it sets up in a cup base.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP052124-238x300.jpg)The S&P 500 led the way with a gain of nearly 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite edged up 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index dipped 0.2%. Volume was mixed: lower on the Nasdaq and slightly higher on the NYSE.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by about 3-to-2. The ratio was less than 2-to-1 negative on the NYSE.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed, rising 0.4%, led by strong showings for **Powell Industries** ([POWL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWL)) and **Oscar Health** ([OSCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR)). Powell closed just above a 183.49 handle buy point.


The 10-year Treasury yield eased 2 basis points to around 4.41% after finding support at the 200-day moving average last week near 4.33%. The stock market probably won't like it if the 10-year yield breaks out of its latest downtrend. For that to happen, the yield would need to make a decisive move above 4.50%.

The Fed has made it abundantly clear that it needs to see more signs of cooling inflation before it starts cutting interest rates. According to [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), the market expects the first rate cut to come at the September meeting. But that's far from a sure thing, with the chances of a quarter-point cut only 65% at this point. There's still a lot of data to parse between now and then.


Stocks To Watch Now
-------------------


IBD raised its suggested exposure percentage to 80%-100% last week when the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4% in higher volume on May 15. The bullish session qualified as [a follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on the 18th day of a rally attempt that started on April 22.


The follow-through occurred late in the rally attempt, but there's no doubt that growth stocks continue to act well. This month's breakouts from the likes of **Globus Medical** ([GMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMED)), **Embraer** ([ERJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERJ)) and **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) still look good, while stocks in the health care sector like **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) are still near buy points.


In the aerospace and defense group, new issue **Loar Holdings** ([LOAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOAR)) soared out of an IPO base, rising 8.5%. It's still in the 5% buy zone from a 54.32 buy point.



Leaderboard stock **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) broke out in higher volume in the stock market today after the company announced [positive late-stage trial results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/eli-lilly-stock-break-out-record-high-crohns-disease/) for a drug to treat Crohn's disease. Lilly shares gapped up on the news and reclaimed a prior double-bottom entry of 793.67. The drugmaker also closed above an alternate entry of 795.50.


Meanwhile, the right side of **Celsius**' ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) cup base shows plenty of higher-volume gains, strengthening the stock's technical picture. Watch to see if Celsius starts to drift lower in light volume and form a handle from here. That would be ideal price action after a bullish move off lows. The handle area is where the last remaining sellers get shaken out of a stock, paving the way for an upside breakout.


Digital pharmacy **Hims & Hers Health** ([HIMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIMS)) slumped 5.5% in lower volume. The stock is back in the 5% buy zone from a 17.16 entry. Shares jumped Tuesday after the company said it was adding GLP-1 weight-loss injections to its offerings.



The company provides lower-cost and generic alternatives to popular brand-name drugs. The company is expected to deliver its first yearly profit this year, with growth ramping higher in 2025, up 81% to 25 cents a share.

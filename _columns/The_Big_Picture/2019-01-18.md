Stocks galloped ahead Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average led the major stock indexes. A blowout number on manufacturing added to the day's bullish tilt.




Blue chips were mostly up with eight stocks from the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average rising 1.7% or more. The Dow gained 1.4%.


The S&P 500 followed closely, up 1.3%. The Nasdaq spurted 1%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 also added 1%.


Volume was up on both major exchanges compared with the previous session. Friday was an options expirations day, which tends to crank up volume.


Manufacturing Stunner
---------------------


Industrial production in December rose 0.3%, in line with the Street's view. But the manufacturing gauge jumped 1.1%, a stunning percentage that trounced estimates for a 0.1% gain.

China Factor
------------


News on China continues to push the stock market one way or the other. A report from Bloomberg News, based on anonymous sources, said China offered to import $1 trillion more in U.S. goods over the next six years.


China's stock markets were closed when the news came out, but many [U.S.-traded Chinese stocks rose on the news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/china-stocks-trade-war/).


Investors have heard China reports for months now, with the anonymous source stories giving a pop to stocks and then the news is walked back or forgotten.


Earnings The True Force
-----------------------


At this juncture, earnings season might be the true force behind the gains.


During the week, a number of stocks delivered results that topped the Street's estimates.


For instance, of the 27 banks that reported earnings and that IBD tracks, 15 topped views, one matched and 11 missed.


That might sound unimpressive but take it a step further: After reporting results, 24 of the stocks rose and only three fell. Nine of the 11 banks that missed on earnings advanced anyhow.


Need To Adjust Tactics
----------------------


The troubling part for IBD-style investors is the lack of breakouts. This only means, though, that the investor must adjust.


Trend lines can offer an alternative entry. This is especially valuable when stocks are well off their highs.


Here's another approach to the current market: Going into Friday's session, seven stock groups moved into the top 40 rapidly from three weeks ago. The seven are computer tech services, mortgage finance, variety stores, medical services, farm machinery, alternative energy and meat.


Stocks in these groups with interesting charts include **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **Globant** ([GLOB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOB)), **HFF** ([HF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HF)), **KKR Real Estate** ([KREF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KREF)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **BioTelemetry** ([BEAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEAT)), **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)), **Arcosa** ([ACA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACA)) andÂ **TPI Composites** ([TPIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPIC)).

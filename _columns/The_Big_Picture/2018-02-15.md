Stocks Charge Ahead, But One Breakout Is Unwound
=================================================

U.S. stock indexes posted solid follow-up gains Thursday, adding to the conviction that the market is back in a confirmed uptrend.




 The stock market [flashed a green signal](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) Wednesday, shifting the market outlook from correction to confirmed uptrend.


On Thursday, the Nasdaq advanced 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose 1.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lagged slightly with a 1% gain.


Volume was lower on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.


Small caps have lagged the major indexes so far this year. The Russell 2000 is down 1%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are up 5% and 2% respectively.

The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 13% in 2017 vs. 19% for the S&P 500 and 28% for the Nasdaq. Small-cap participation is more significant in a market rebound.


Breakouts in the first two days of the new uptrend included: remote connectivity software provider **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)); **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)); data storage firm **Carbonite** ([CARB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARB)); drugmaker **Bristol-Myers-Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)); Puerto Rican  bank **Popular** ([BPOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BPOP)); and Mexican wireless firm **America Movil** ([AMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMX)).


[LogMeIn reported results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/logmein-earnings-guidance-tops-views-but-revenue-outlook-light/) Thursday after the close. The midcap company topped views on earnings and revenue by modest amounts. After hours, the stock dived 6%, unwinding its latest breakout.


Individual investors should watch the breakouts in the coming days. A rally's leaders often emerge in the first few weeks of a new uptrend.


For example, in relation to the Sept. 1, 2010 follow-through day, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) broke out the same day and gained 70% in three months. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) broke out Sept. 13 of that year and advanced 37% in five months. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) broke out Sept. 14 and rose 197% in 10 months.


This is what IBD-style investors are looking for in any rally — the leaders that could deliver outsized gains after a breakout.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the stock action during the recent correction and subsequent rebound has been almost uniformly weak.

This suggests the selling was widespread rather than targeted. Some bulls might consider that a good thing — a washout that thins the weak holders makes a rally more likely to work.


Two Items To Focus On
---------------------


Individual investors should be laser-focused on two items. The first is watching the breakouts day by day in hopes of identifying and buying a leader.


The second is watching the indexes, which despite the follow-through day are not yet out of the potential trouble zone.


Research shows that a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in any of the first three sessions after a follow-through day can foretell a failed rally. A distribution day that comes later is easier for a rally to overcome.


Distribution involves a loss in rising volume, which points to institutional selling.


Economic News
-------------


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 230,000, essentially in line with the consensus view for 229,000.


The Philadelphia Fed's business outlook gauge for February came in at 25.8 which was above the highest estimate and more than 20% above the consensus view for 21. The Philly gauge tracks manufacturing trends.


The Empire State manufacturing gauge sent the opposite message vs. the Philly Fed. The consensus estimate was for 17.5 in February, but the reading fell short at 13.1.


The producer price index for January matched expectations at 0.4%. The consumer price index released Wednesday shook some market watchers up with a 0.5% reading for January vs. views for 0.3%. The market itself seemed to shrug off the news.

  Stock Indexes Face Crucial Test

 Stock indexes closed modestly higher Tuesday in a hesitant advance that indicated the battle for new highs is being contested.


The S&P 500 index added 0.2% to make it four up days in a row. The S&P is seriously testing resistance at 2400, which stands as a key crossing for the market. The index, which climbed as high as 2400.85 before retreating a bit, has not moved above 2400 since its first attempt March 1.


The Dow Jones industrial average also rose 0.2% and faces a ceiling around the 21,000 level. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.3% and had a small victory by closing above the 50-day moving average for the first time in a week. Bulls have to hope other indexes follow the Russell's lead.

The Dow utilities average, which has been outperforming, rose 0.2%. It reached the highest level since July before it pared gains late in the session. Sector rotation has favored utilities this spring. The SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) ETF rose 0.3%, adding to Monday's breakout from a 52.33 buy point.


Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq. Winners led losers by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by a small edge on the Nasdaq.


The April 18 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) on the S&P expired by virtue of age. That leaves only two on the S&P and three on the Nasdaq. While indexes are at levels that will help determine their direction, don't forget that distribution is the best indicator of market weakness. Investors can take some comfort in the current low numbers.


Yet, the market uptrend remains under pressure and has not done enough to merit a better assessment. Be cautious with any stock holdings; sell quicker than normal and be more restrained with new share purchases. Sell rules and judicious buying will be your guardrails while the market is uncertain.


A terrorist bombing in Manchester, England, on Monday night sent stock futures lower. But Wall Street opened higher and held its gains.


Metal, banking and energy stocks led the market. Homebuilders, a top-10 industry group, lagged after new-home sales fell 11.4% in April to an annual rate of 569,000 units, well below expectations for 602,000. That followed last week's report on housing starts and building permits, which also showed declines.


**Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) burst out in early trading on better-than-expected earnings, but the builder of luxury homes reversed lower in heavy volume: a bearish outcome but not a sell signal.


IBD's auto-parts stores industry group was the worst performing on Tuesday, down about 8%, after **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) missed sales and profit expectations. Shares plunged 12% in big volume. **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), which reports earnings Wednesday before the open,  fell 4.5% in sympathy.


Chinese internet stocks remained hotly traded. Several fell in volume, though they seemed to be making normal declines after heated run-ups. **Sohu.com** ([SOHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOHU)), **Changyou.com** ([CYOU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYOU)), **Weibo** ([WB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WB)) and **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) were down 1% to 5% in busy trading.


**Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), however, reversed lower. Despite that, it beat quarterly expectations. The Chinese social network has become more volatile.


**YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) broke out past the 56.31 buy point of a cup-with-handle base but closed below the entry in volume 35% above average.

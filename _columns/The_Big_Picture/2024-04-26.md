  Stock Market Surge Prompts This Bullish Change; Fed Meeting, Key AI Stock Earnings Loom

Stocks rallied back in furious fashion Friday, prompting a bullish switch in the market's direction. The latest Federal Reserve meeting and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) earnings are among the noteworthy events in the coming week.




The Nasdaq composite surged 2% Friday and turned in an even more substantial weekly gain of 4.2%. The index snapped a four-week losing streak in the process and is now less than 1% below its key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). The tech-heavy index is now up slightly more than 6% so far this year.


The S&P 500 also did well, rallying 1% for the session. Its 2.7% gain for the week was its best weekly gain since November. It is a little more than 1% below the 50-day line but is back above the 21-day exponential moving average. The benchmark index is up just shy of 7% so far in 2024.


Advancers led decliners by about 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange but less than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq exchange.


Other indexes shared in the gains on the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a modest 0.4% while the Russell 2000 turned in a 1.1% lift. The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund turned in a 0.8% gain.


This week's strong rebound from lows, and encouraging Big Tech earnings, justify raising market exposure to the 20%-40% level. But the lower volume on the upward thrust means it doesn't technically qualify as a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).

Big Tech Shines, Fed Meeting Looms
----------------------------------


The power of good earnings reports from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) helped investors shrug off Thursday's negative action on the stock market following a disappointing report from **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META))


In addition, investors seemed to take a slightly hotter-than-expected personal consumption expenditures price index report in their stride. Headline PCE rose 2.7% year over year while core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.8% on an annualized basis. It was very much a case [where it was not as bad as some feared](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-rate-core-pce-march-rate-cuts-sp-500/).


The Federal Open Market Committee plans to meet Tuesday and Wednesday, and many see it holding interest rates steady. But investors will be listening intently to Wednesday's post-meeting press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. There, the markets seek further guidance on the path of interest rates.


There is also more important economic data on the horizon. The latest consumer confidence reading is due Tuesday while the ADP employment report is expected Wednesday. But the key report will be the April jobs report on Friday. Analysts expect the U.S. economy to have added 250,000 new jobs, a decline from the previous month. Analysts see the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.8%.


There also will be some [noteworthy earnings reports in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/amazon-amzn-stock-super-micro-smci-earnings/). **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) are due, but many investors hot on the current artificial intelligence trend will be most glued to the quarterly report from Super Micro. This is especially true given it failed to provide a preliminary outlook heading into earnings, breaking a recent habit.

These Stock Market Areas Shine
------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors closed mixed Friday](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) despite the positive action at index level. Technology and communication services made the best gains. The defensive utilities area and energy fell the most.



The relative performance of the Investor's Business Daily industry groups offered a deeper insight into the action on the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Computer hardware stocks, solar plays, fabless chip stocks and semiconductor equipment plays all impress. The internet content group, which houses Alphabet, was another top performer.


Hospitals, casino stocks, logistics plays, financial software names and insurance companies all struggled. But trucking transportation plays were hit the hardest following disappointing earnings from **Saia** ([SAIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIA)).

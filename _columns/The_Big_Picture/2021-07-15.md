Stock Market Mixed After Powell Testimony; Why AMD's Upcoming Earnings Are Key
===============================================================================

The stock market ended mostly lower Thursday, as the Nasdaq slid after Fed chief Jerome Powell's Senate testimony. Leading stocks continued to show cracks.




Powell testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, defending the Federal Reserve's easy money policy. "This is a shock going through the system associated with the reopening of the economy and it's driven inflation well above 2%, and of course we're not comfortable with that," Powell said. On Wednesday, Powell reassured investors that the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policies will continue. He reiterated views that price spikes are probably temporary.


The Nasdaq declined 0.7% Thursday, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.6%.


Leading growth stocks suffered sharp losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded over 1% lower. The ETF is near the lowest levels of the year. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) tumbled over 3% Thursday, extending a losing streak to four sessions. Shares are trying to find support at their 50-day moving average. The company reports earnings next week.

Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and eased on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's numbers.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


The Nasdaq extended its losing streak three sessions, falling further from this week's record highs. The tech-heavy composite is attempting to stop its slide around the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). The S&P 500 also backed off after making record highs earlier in the week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrials continue to have trouble decisively moving above the 35,000 level.


The stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend, even though the [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count is starting to climb. The S&P 500 has five distribution days, including a stall day on Wednesday. The Nasdaq's count upped to three Thursday after narrowly missing a distribution day Wednesday due to lower volume.


[Wednesday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-finishes-mixed-after-powell-talk-but-some-emerging-leaders-show-ugly-reversals/) cautioned investors to tread carefully with new buys for now due to some nasty reversals across growth stocks. Meanwhile, some recent breakouts haven't fared very well. **Upwork** ([UPWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPWK)) triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule from a 61.31 buy point Wednesday just one day after the breakout. IBD 50 stock **Global-E Online**'s ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)) breakout also failed during Wednesday's steep drop.

Stock Analysis: AMD
-------------------



Chip giant **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is tracing a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that shows a 95.54 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares dropped 2.4% Thursday, as **Taiwan Semiconductor**'s ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) [earnings weighed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-earnings-match-estimates/) on the chip sector. TSM stock stumbled 5.5%. Graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) slid over 2%, another blemish for the chip sector. The stock recently reached the 20%-25% profit-taking zone from a 648.67 buy point in a cup base, but is now below it.


While Advanced Micro's fundamental strength is undeniable, there is a key weakness: a lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/). Despite strengthening in recent weeks, the RS line remains far from its old highs. A lagging RS line is a sign of an underperforming stock relative to the broad market.


AMD's July 27 results could provide the necessary catalyst for further upside. Analysts expect AMD's earnings to surge 200% year over year to 54 cents per share on revenue of $3.62 billion. But of course there's also the risk of weaker-than-expected earnings or cautious guidance.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [AMD stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx) shows a strong 98 out of 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/). The IBD Composite Rating identifies stocks with a blend of strong fundamental and technical characteristics. AMD was featured as [Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amd-stock-nears-buy-point-ahead-of-earnings/)


Stocks To Watch: BioNTech, Roku
-------------------------------


**BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) rallied 4.3% Thursday, rebounding from the 50-day moving average and placing the vaccine stock in a new buy area. BioNTech is a new [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) watchlist stock **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) continues to build a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), offering a 463.09 buy point. Shares are about 10% away from the new buy point after a three-day losing streak. The stock dropped 1.7% Thursday.

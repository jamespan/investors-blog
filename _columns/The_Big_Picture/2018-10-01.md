A trade deal with Canada was good news for Dow stocks Monday. But growth investors were left with a bad taste in their mouth by the close as tech stocks and small caps turned in weak performances.




The Dow Jones advanced 0.7%, helped by strength in [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), while the S&P 500 added 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite was up nearly 0.8% early but reversed lower for a loss of 0.1%. Small caps took heat along with the IBD 50. The Russell 2000 cratered 1.4%, marking its fourth straight close below the 50-day moving average. The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) eased 0.4%.


Tech Stocks Weak
----------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) slumped nearly 1%, weighed down by weakness in tech stocks like **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) and **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)). All four ended with losses of more than 2%.

NYSE and Nasdaq volume was lower than Friday's levels.


At first glance, the Nasdaq's distribution-day count might seem high, with seven higher-volume declines since Aug. 30. But keep in mind that there have only been two instances of unequivocal institutional selling in the index: a 1.2% decline on Sept. 5 and a 1.4% decline on Sept. 17.


Nafta Deal Sparks Optimism
--------------------------


President Donald Trump's new Nafta deal, now called the [United States-Mexico-Canada agreement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-us-canada-mexico-trade-deal-protectionist/), will give U.S. farmers greater access to Canada's dairy market, among other things. To protect its dairy farmers, Canada has restrictions on how much dairy can be produced in the country as well as how much foreign dairy can enter.


The new trade agreement also spares automakers from costly tariffs on cars imported from Canada and Mexico. Automakers **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)), **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) and **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) ended with gains ranging from 0.8% to 2.7%.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was another big gainer in the auto group, up 17% on news of an [SEC settlement](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-elon-musk-lawsuit/).


Transports On The Move
----------------------


Railroad operators did well, handily outperforming a 0.3% gain for the Dow Jones Transportation average. **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising 3% in solid volume. **Canadian National Railway** ([CNI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNI)) popped above a 90.67 flat-base entry. Shares rose nearly 2% to 91.40.


In the energy sector, pipeline operators outperformed amid another surge in oil prices. Solid gainers in the group included **Phillips 66 Partners** ([PSXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSXP)), **Andeavor Logistics** ([ANDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANDX)) and **Energy Transfer Partners** ([ETP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETP)).


November West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled at $75.30 a barrel, up 2.8%. Brent crude, the European benchmark, added 2.7% to $84.98 a barrel.


Top Stocks Today
----------------


**Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) was a top gainer in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com). Shares jumped nearly 15%, helped by an upgrade from William Blair to outperform. Euronet confirmed Monday that **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) adopted [a rule change on international ATM transactions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euronet-acknowledges-visa-rule-change-110000566.html) that will favor Euronet.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) bucked the overall weakness in tech stocks. It was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up 3% in solid volume. An initial breakout attempt over the 269.30 buy point initially stalled, but the stock found support at the 50-day moving average. The breakout got going Friday after Evercore made positive comments and raised its price target to 400 from 300.


After the close, **Stitch Fix** ([SFIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFIX)) fell sharply on a sales miss. Shares were trading around 35.89, down about 20%.

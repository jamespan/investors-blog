Nasdaq, Russell 2000 Lead Mild Rally In Lower Volume

The S&P 500 marched to its eighth gain in 10 sessions Wednesday and notched a fresh all-time high.


But thanks in large part to top performers in the semiconductor and biotech industries, the Nasdaq stole the show.


The Nasdaq composite brushed off early mild losses — sparked by disappointing news on the U.S. private sector jobs front and a negative revision in Q1 productivity — and rallied 0.4%, marking its highest close since April 2. The Nasdaq's gain by itself was not hefty, but it did wipe away the mild losses from the three prior sessions.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index also rose 0.4%. It's now up 14% since Jan. 1. That's even better than a 11.6% gain by the Dow utility average, one of the year's best.


The S&P 500, the premier benchmark for large-cap equities, inched 0.2% higher. It swung from 0.3% morning loss and finished almost at its session high. Volume slowed on both exchanges.


Since the Nasdaq's May 27 follow-through, institutional accumulation has been noticeably absent on the composite. After a 1.2% rise that day, there has yet to be a day of solid gains in heavier trade. Fund managers may be busier booking trips to World Cup matches in Brazil than grabbing large amounts of shares.


Yet the day-to-day action has not been supremely negative, either. The distribution day count is still a clean slate. The major indexes are finishing well in the upper half of the day's range. New highs outpace new lows. (See Page B5.)


A few more stocks got closer to breakout territory (see the Market Pulse table), rising substantially in sharply higher volume than usual.


The latest Investors Intelligence survey of market gurus (bulls at 62.2%, bears at 17.4%, correction at 20.4%) signals a stubbornly high level of optimists. Some experts note that the low reading in the CBOE volatility index means that complacency can be seen in every corner of Wall Street.


Should the individual investor worry? Yes and no. Markets do eventually top — sometimes in a nasty way — when bullishness reaches such an extreme level. However, it can take months before the market peaks. Back in February 1987, the bulls soared to 64.4%, well before the October correction ended with the awful Black Monday crash.


In January and April of 1986, bulls hit a peak of 68.3% and 61.2%, respectively. Yet the market made a strong run in the first half of that year (the Dow rallied 23%) before finally cooling off right before the July 4 holiday.


Sentiment indicators are poor tools to pinpoint the market top. Instead, closely watch how the market and your stocks act on a daily or weekly basis. When breakouts end up in flames and heavy distribution rocks the major indexes over a few weeks, that's the time to lock in gains, raise cash and step to the sidelines.

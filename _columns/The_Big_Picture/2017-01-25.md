  Stocks Surge Again; Why These Figures Are More Critical Than 'Dow 20,000'

Stocks up. Small caps up. Really large caps up. Bond yields up. Commodities up. Foreign equities up.


Is this going to be a common refrain of the [Donald Trump bull market](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-win-stocks-rise-new-bull-market/)?


Of course, all predictions are nothing more than that, and they can be wrong more often than right.


However, the savvy investor makes judgments about the current direction of the market by evaluating the hard evidence presented each day at a time. And lately, the evidence has been overwhelmingly positive for the bulls.


![MP012517](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP012517-155x300.png)Stocks on Wednesday added to Tuesday's steep advance as the Dow Jones industrial average cracked the psychologically interesting 20,000 level for the first time, rising 0.8% and marking an all-time high in the process.


The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 joined the 30-stock blue chip index in striking new high ground. The Nasdaq edged out the S&P 500 with a gain of almost 1% and is now up 5% for the year, one of its strongest start-of-the-year advances in years.


The S&P was up 0.8%, matching the Dow's and NYSE composite's gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1%.


More important than Dow 20,000, clearly, is the increase in opportunities for investors who use charts to pinpoint excellent entry points. Within the Dow 30 itself, more stocks are acting right.


Dow industrials component and hefty dividend payer **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) staged its second breakout in less than three months. On Oct. 26, the jet maker roared past a 139.55 buy point. On Wednesday, following its earnings, the stock topped the 160.17 buy point of a flat base.


Nasdaq volume rose but fell on the NYSE, according to preliminary figures. The general trend of higher volume in recent up days came as no surprise, given that the Accumulation/Distribution ratings for both the Nasdaq and the S&P have been B or higher for a few weeks. (Track this rating for the key stock averages by going to the General Market Indicators page via the link at the bottom of this article.)


 Like a professional basketball team in which fresh players get off the bench and hit the floor to allow others to take a break, the market displayed similar player substitutions. Homebuilders, led by media-shy **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) (Q4 EPS up 18%, sales up 13%), blasted higher on good results to offset weakness among steel producers.
While Leaderboard member **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) showed a wild post-earnings session (EPS of 17 cents vs. a 2-cent loss a year ago, sales up 24%, best in 10 quarters) and lost 3% for the day, banking stocks picked up the slack. Bunches of lenders of all stripes and sizes showed nice rallies off the 10-week moving average as interest rates continued to rebound.


The U.S. Treasury 10-year bond yield jumped back above 2.5% for the first time in more than three weeks, even as the U.S. dollar showed a bit of weakness on Wednesday. The British pound rose against the dollar, back to $1.26.


Rising yields anticipate higher inflation, which can benefit commodity producers. The higher yields also will likely encourage banks, suffering from tight margins on loans, to give businesses more money to expand.


From a technical perspective, Wednesday's session showed numerous layers of solid demand for stocks. Winners beat losers by a nearly 5-to-2 margin on the Nasdaq and nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE.


IBD's [screened list of new highs](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) is likely to go well into the 100s. Just last week, the average number of screened new highs on the Nasdaq was a skimpy 81; the NYSE fared a little worse at 78.


And while the "America First" rhetoric from President Trump is unlikely to tone down anytime soon, one has to acknowledge strength in a number of major equity markets overseas.


 The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 were not the only indexes to gap higher on Wednesday or in recent sessions. Check out the iShares MSCI Germany ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)) (up 1.6% on Wednesday, up 5.4% for the year) and the iShares MSCI France ([EWQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWQ)) (up 0.8%, up 3.2% YTD) index ETFs.
Meanwhile, iShares Latin America 40 ([ILF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILF)) has posted five up-days in a row; at 31.02, it's now up 12.5% year to date.


At some point, U.S. stocks will indeed cool off. Investor complacency, as measured by the CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, is dangerously thick. The VIX hit extreme lows at the end of 1993, the end of 2006 and the spring of 2011, and each time the indexes staged sharp corrections of 20% or more.


Track the VIX by going to IBD's [Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) feature, found within the Market Trend section at the home page of Investors.com.


While the economy remains in good shape, investor fear can be strong enough to force stocks into a mini-correction. Many of those happened in 2015 and 2016. Today, the media is flashing headlines predicting what could slow down Trump's agenda. Will it be smaller Social Security benefits in the future? What will Brexit be like? Can Trump really build a wall, and can America afford it?


No single person will have all the right answers. But the collective decision done in real time by millions of market participants will give you all the guidance you will need.


What does that cost? Simply the discipline of assessing and accepting the day-to-day action of the major indexes.


Bullishness edged lower to 58.2%.

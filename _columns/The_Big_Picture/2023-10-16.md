  Stock Market Bounces Despite Risks; What To Watch For Next

The stock market continued to toy with investors' emotions Monday, rallying broadly as it looked past the current geopolitical climate, upcoming earnings and other potential risks. A few stock breakouts added to a bullish vibe.




For a market uptrend that [came under pressure just last Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sinks-broadly-as-nasdaq-gets-rejected-at-key-level-triggering-this-outlook-change/), Monday's rebound was a relief. Yet, the stock market still faces considerable risks. While index gains were satisfying, sellers continue to challenge significant chart levels.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.2% as technology and internet sectors led the market. For the fifth consecutive session, the index met resistance near the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). That's an immediate barrier to watch.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed 1.1% and is approaching a test of a downward-sloping 50-day moving average.


Finally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9% and closed back above the 200-day moving average. The Dow now is testing the 34,000 level, which could be more significant. It's been a demarcation line of both support and resistance many times this year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP101623-229x300.jpg)Stocks rallied despite a rise in Treasury yields. The 10-year yield rose 8 basis points to 4.71%.


In the Middle East, [tensions remained high](https://www.wsj.com/world/how-the-israel-hamas-war-is-tilting-the-global-power-balance-in-favor-of-russia-china-6fe4710a) with the potential for the Israel-Hamas crisis to widen. Israel hasn't launched an expected assault into Gaza, while a number of nations work to free hostages held by Hamas.


Crude oil prices, which spiked last week, eased Monday. Nymex crude for November delivery fell 1.2% to $86.66 a barrel. Brent crude for December delivery dropped 1.4% to $89.65.


Small Caps Lag Stock Market
---------------------------


Small caps also rebounded, with a 1.6% jump in the Russell 2000. But the index — probably more sensitive to the economy than other indexes — remains nearly 13% below its August peak.


And the Russell's 50-day moving average is now below the 200-day line — a signal that some call the "death cross." Chart watchers have the 1,700 level to fall back on, where the small-cap index bottomed in March and May.


On the plus side, there was broad participation in Monday's rally. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF — which diminishes the oversize influence of the megacaps — rose nearly 1.3% Monday.


Advancing stocks topped decliners by nearly 2-1 on the Nasdaq and by 5-2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Breadth has been one of the market's most worrisome aspects, so Monday's ratios were welcomed.


Since August, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been trending downward even as the index has been going sideways. On the NYSE, that line looks better but is still trending downward.


Fed Comments Help Stock Market
------------------------------


The market's bounce was aided by Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. He told the Financial Times that [progress fighting inflation has not stalled](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-goolsbee-says-declining-inflation-is-a-trend-and-not-a-blip-4897805b) despite last week's consumer price index.


Evidence shows inflation is trending down, said Goolsbee, who is a voting member of the Fed's policymaking committee. "It's undeniable this is a trend. It wasn't a one-month blip," he said.


The IBD 50 rose 1.1%. **Duolingo** ([DUOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DUOL)) and **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) regained buy points.



Some of the best action in stocks was outside the IBD 50. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) and remained in a buy zone from the 406.94 buy point. The company [will become part of the S&P 500 index](https://www.investors.com/news/sp-500-lululemon-athletica-to-join-index-lulu-stock-flashes-buy-signal/) as of Wednesday.


Action Among News Corp, Varonis, Williams
-----------------------------------------


**News Corp** ([NWS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NWS)) broke out of a cup base with a 21.14 buy point, while class A shares broke out above 21.64. Activist investor Starboard Value has [built a stake in News Corp](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/activist-builds-news-corp-stake-plans-to-seek-changes-c45896da?mod=mktw&mod=article_inline) with the intention of pushing for strategic changes at the media company. News Corp is the parent company of Investor's Business Daily.


Data analytics provider **Varonis Systems** ([VRNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRNS)) broke out from a flat base and closed near the 32.64 buy point. Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock from equal-weight to overweight and raised the price target from 34 to 39, reports said. **Williams Cos.** ([WMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMB)) topped a 35.46 buy point but volume was weak.


Although the stock market had plenty to offer Monday, IBD's outlook remains "uptrend under pressure." This means investors need to be reducing exposure and proceed with care until the market can strengthen more.


Earnings season continues this week, which is another reason to be on guard.

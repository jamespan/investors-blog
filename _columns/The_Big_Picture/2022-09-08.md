Stock Market Continues To Rebound After Powell Comments; 4 Leaders To Watch
============================================================================

The stock market ended a choppy session with solid gains Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments on the economy reaffirm the necessity of combating high inflation.




Amid a stock market uptrend that is trying to rebound, these four leaders — **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)), **DoubleVerify** ([DV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DV)) and **SM Energy** ([SM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SM)) — are holding up well.


Powell Comments, Jobless Claims
-------------------------------


Early Thursday, [Powell commented](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-set-to-speak-on-economic-outlook-11662640201), "It is very much our view, and my view, that we need to act now forthrightly, strongly, as we have been doing, and we need to keep at it until the job is done." The comments came at the Cato Institute's annual monetary conference.


The next Fed interest rate decision is scheduled for Sept. 21. And [markets place an 86% chance](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) that the Fed will raise rates by another 75 basis points, according to the CME Group data.


First-time jobless claims unexpectedly fell to 222,000, well below the forecast for a rise to 240,000. Jobless claims were 232,000 in the previous week. A strong job market gives the Fed more room to raise rates.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%, while the S&P 500 closed 0.7% higher. The Nasdaq composite — which had been down as much as 1.1% — moved up 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.8%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and appeared to be slightly higher on the NYSE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP090822-237x300.jpg)Among the S&P sectors, financials and health care outperformed, rising 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. On the downside, transportation and consumer staples both fell 0.3% each.


Top growth stocks outperformed Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1.5%, but it remains a bit below its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) dived 7.5%, breaking through the 50-day line.


Stock Market Trend: What To Do Now
----------------------------------


Despite two straight days of gains, the stock market trend remains "under pressure." The Nasdaq, which ended a seven-session losing streak Wednesday, remains below its 50-day line. So investors should still be focused on defense.


If the market is able to mount a serious rebound, then you should have a watchlist of leading stocks that are approaching buy points. Some follow-on opportunities also may appear.


The best way to find emerging stock market leadership is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock lags the broad market, the line will point lower.


The RS line is plotted on all IBD and MarketSmith charts. In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with relative strength lines at new highs. MarketSmith also has the "RS Blue Line Dot" list, which screens for RS lines at new highs. (Starting Monday, [IBD MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=MarketSmith-Free-Access) is providing free access for a full week.)

Stock Market Leaders To Watch
-----------------------------



Amid the stock market volatility, these four leaders are among the stocks to watch: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Cross Country Healthcare, DoubleVerify and SM Energy.


Chipotle is nearing a [cup with handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) 1,724.97 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis, after rising 1.5% Thursday. Shares are just 1% away from the latest buy point.


Health care staffing leader Cross Country is just shy of a [cup with handle'](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/)s 27.87 entry after a 5.5% advance.


New [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) DoubleVerify is breaking out past a 28.07 buy point in a bottoming base. Shares are in the 5% buy zone that goes up to 29.47. The company specializes in platforms to help advertisers get a better view on the effectiveness of their ad spending and campaigns.


Oil and gas explorer and producer SM Energy continues to trace a cup with handle that has a 47.29 buy point. A real flaw is the stock's lagging [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). It remains relatively far from its old highs, reached in mid-June.

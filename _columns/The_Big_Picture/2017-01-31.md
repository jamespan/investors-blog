Stocks Trim Losses; Will Apple's Rise After Hours Help Techs?

The main indexes closed mostly lower Tuesday but pared most losses as the market wrestles with some uncertainty.


The Nasdaq erased a 0.7% midday loss to close with a minuscule gain. The S&P 500 ended 0.1% lower, but the Dow Jones industrial average was not able to bounce as much and it fell 0.5%. The IBD 50 eased 0.1%.


As the indexes reached new highs last week, there were signs that some profit-taking was likely to happen. So, there may still be some selling on the horizon. For the second day in row, buyers came in late in the session, and that suggests institutional investors are mostly content with their portfolios.


![mp013117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP013117-192x300.png)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE. The Dec. 22 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) is now too old to be a factor, and that left the Nasdaq with six on and the S&P 500 with five. That's a manageable number of higher-volume losses.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the biggest company in the stock market by market capitalization, reported quarterly results after the close. Shares rose modestly immediately after the report, which topped expectations.


A rise in Apple stock would be welcome for a technology sector that's seen its star stocks underperform. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) have not followed through from buy points. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is 0.5% below 824.40 entry. Apple's own breakout past 118.12 has been slow to advance.


Earnings, President's Trump's policy moves and a Federal Reserve meeting are adding uncertainty to the market. Tuesday's market reflected the president's pronouncements as gold, medical and financial stocks made significant moves.


The president — who has lashed out at particular industries — was conciliatory in a [meeting with pharmaceutical executives](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-fang-stocks-up-in-january-amid-trump-tumult/) Tuesday. Biotech, generic drug and drug wholesalers were among the day's best-performing industry groups as investors breathed a sigh of relief.


Major banks are sensitive to international markets, which were shaken after Trump began a travel ban on visitors from some Muslim-majority countries. A drop in bond yields also hurt banks.


Uncertainly over Trump's trade and refugee policies appear to have [caused gold prices to climb](https://www.investors.com/news/gold-prices-stocks-rally-as-trump-talk-hits-dollar/). Trump also expressed concerns about the strong dollar, another factor that contributed to gold's rise.


Utilities, sought when investors are nervous, were the day's winners. The Dow utilities average jumped nearly 1.7%. But the Dow transports slid 1.5%. Airlines have tumbled this week in response to the U.S. travel restrictions.


Trucking, rail and airfreight stocks also were laggards. **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) gapped down to a 7% loss. Shares closed below the 200-day moving average for the first time since March. Profit fell short of Wall Street estimates for the critical holiday fourth-quarter early Tuesday and gave weak full-year guidance.


Earnings are driving much of the market, and the results haven't been so great so far.


**Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) plunged 26% in huge volume after fourth-quarter earnings disappointed and the company's CFO decided to step down due to personal reasons. Profit was a penny lower than a year ago, as sales rose 12% to $1.308 billion, the smallest gain in eight years.


With one-third of all S&P 500 companies having announced quarterly results, fewer are reporting earnings and sales above estimates compared with the five-year and one-year averages, FactSet noted in a report Tuesday. In addition, companies are posting profits 2.7% above estimates and flat revenues compared to estimates — numbers that also lag the five-year average.


The Federal Reserve ends a two-day meeting Wednesday afternoon. Although no change is expected in interest rates, the Fed's policy statement always draws heavy attention, if not fear.

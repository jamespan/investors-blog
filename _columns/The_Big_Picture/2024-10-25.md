The stock market ended the day and week mixed as the Nasdaq touched a fresh high. Earnings reports from Magnificent Seven names including **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), as well as the latest jobs report, are due.


The Nasdaq composite was the standout performer among the major indexes as it rallied 0.6% Friday, though it ended well off session highs. The tech-heavy index notched an intraday record high and turned in a weekly gain of 0.2%. It sits comfortably clear of its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and holds a gain of 23.4% for the year so far.




The S&P 500 fell fractionally Friday, but was essentially flat. It notched a weekly decline of 1%, backing off from the prior week's all-time high levels. Nevertheless, the benchmark index is holding above the 21-day and 50-day lines and remains up 21.8% in 2024.


Decliners led advancers on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE. The Sept. 20 distribution day came off the Nasdaq's count due to time.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was hit the hardest out of the major indexes as it fell 0.6%. Its weekly decline was also heavier at 2.7%. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) fared best. **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) was the worst laggard, falling 3% amid the ongoing fallout from an E. coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder burgers.


Small caps had a tough time on the stock market, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.5% Friday and ending the week down 3%. Growth stocks dug in though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund ending well off its lows for the week despite skidding 0.1% Friday.


Magnificent Seven Earnings, Jobs Report Next
--------------------------------------------


There was a sprinkling of economic data Friday, with the Census Bureau reporting durable-goods orders falling 0.8% in September. This matched the decline of the previous month. This was slightly worse than economists' expectations for a 0.5% drop, according to Econoday. The ongoing strike at **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) had an effect, with orders rising 0.4% when autos and aircraft were excluded.

It was partially helped by growing confidence among Republicans of a Donald Trump victory for the U.S. presidency. A drop in interest rates also bolstered the mood of consumers.


The coming week sees the release of some important economic data points. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is due Thursday, and should offer a new inflation reading.


A smattering of jobs data also is expected, with job openings figures scheduled for Tuesday, the ADP employment report dropping Wednesday and the pivotal U.S. jobs report due Friday. It is expected that the U.S. economy added 125,000 jobs in October.


As if that wasn't enough, [earnings season will reach a height of intensity](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/meta-platforms-apple-stock-amazon-headline-earnings/) when five of the Magnificent Seven stocks report next week. Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is due to report Tuesday, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) come Wednesday and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) drop Thursday.


Deckers Earnings Kick This Stock Market Group Higher
----------------------------------------------------


The [S&P 500 sectors ended Friday mixed](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/), with a bias to the negative. Communication services and technology were the strongest areas while financials and utilities were the worst laggards.



The relative performance of Investor's Business Daily's 197 industry groups gave a deeper account of the action on [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Specialty consumer products firms, trucking plays, educational software stocks and office supply retailers were all strong. But it was the shoe manufacturing group that fared the best, boosted by a post-earnings rally from **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)). The Ugg parent soared 10.5% after beating views, clearing a handle entry of 167.23 in high volume in the process.


On the flip side, medical supplies plays and a variety of insurance groups and media periodicals all underperformed. Hospitals were hit the hardest though following a disappointing earnings report from **HCA Healthcare** ([HCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCA)), which ended the day down 8.9% and flashed a sell signal by [undercutting the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).

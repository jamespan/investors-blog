Major stock indexes posted small losses Thursday, even as the Dow scored a new high and small caps got smacked.




 The Nasdaq dropped 0.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. The Dow rose as much as 0.35% early but then faded to a 0.3% loss. The small-cap Russell 2000 dived 1.1%.


Volume in [the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) fell on the NYSE, according to preliminary calculations. But volume rose on the Nasdaq, which gave the index a [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/ http://www.investors.com/short-selling/ http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), lifting its count to five. Distribution involves a loss in a major index in rising volume. Such action points to institutional selling.


Negative reversals were commonplace. Stocks such as retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)), machinery tools maker **Kennametal** ([KMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMT)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) began the session higher and then reversed.


Data Strong
-----------


Bullish news was of little help.Â Retail data for November came in much stronger than expected, and first-time jobless claims were fewer than estimated. But the market found no traction from the data.


Areas of the market hit hard included cement stocks, retail and steel.


Blue chips were mostly down. Yet, the Dow Jones industrial average still managed to post a new high in the first five minutes of trade before backing off.


Breakouts
---------


Breakouts were scarce, but three stocks cleared consolidations.


**Nordson** ([NDSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NDSN)) gapped up 13% in huge volume. The stock decisively cleared a 127.71 buy point in a cup-with-handle. Midcap Nordson makes products for dispensing adhesives, coatings and sealants.


**Tiffany & Co.** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)), a jewelry retailer, gapped up 3% on a stock upgrade, crossing a 97.39 buy point. Citigroup raised Tiffany from neutral to buy and raised the price target to 115. Tiffany closed at 99.34.


**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) bolted out of a cup-with-handle base in strong volume. The stock rose 3% to 55.25, ending above a 54.16 entry. At the [company's investor day](https://www.investors.com/news/delta-jumps-into-buy-zone-on-bullish-revenue-outlook-at-investor-day/), CEO Ed Bastian said Delta's pricing power is "the best we've seen in four or five years."


All three stocks emerged from first-stage patterns. As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. The first two breakouts are more likely to work than those from later-stage bases.


Coming Up
---------


Friday will be a quadruple witching day, which involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures. This usually boosts volume. This matters because it can lead to a questionable distribution day if indexes drop.


The Empire State manufacturing gauge for December will be released before the open. Analysts expect a reading of 18, down from November's 19.4. The gauge is the first clue to manufacturing, reported before the Philadelphia Fed's report. The Philly Fed will report Thursday.

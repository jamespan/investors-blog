<p>The Nasdaq composite saw gains fade as it closed down 0.1%, meaning it ended the week with a nearly 1% decline. The tech-heavy index is still looking strong as it sits near highs after rising nine out of the past 11 weeks. It ended the week above its <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/">short-term moving averages</a> after finding support at the 10-day line.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 also saw gains evaporate as it skidded 0.3%. The benchmark index fell just over 1% for the week and now sits at the <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/">10-day moving average</a>. It remains up nearly 15% so far in 2023.</p>
<p>It was not all bad news, though. Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE and about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/">Volume was lower</a> on both indexes, a positive on a down day. At this stage, the stock market uptrend continues to show resilience.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared worst among the major indexes, dropping 0.6%. A test of the <a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tool-50-day-moving-average/">50-day moving average</a> now looks imminent. <strong>Caterpillar</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT" target="_blank">CAT</a>) fared best in the Dow while <strong>Walmart</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT" target="_blank">WMT</a>) and <strong>Merck</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK" target="_blank">MRK</a>) lagged.</p><div class="adunit fluid-ad" data-fluid="true" data-adposition="native" id="-adunit-native" data-uac="1"></div>

Growth stocks faded late but still turned in gains, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY" target="_blank">FFTY</a>) rising 0.4%.</p>
<h2>Jobs Report Comes In Mixed As Earnings Season Looms</h2>
<p>The stock market was initially boosted by the much-awaited June jobs report, with <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/jobs-report-hiring-is-merely-solid-but-wage-growth-is-hot-sp-5000-slips/">hiring still firm</a> as employers added 209,000 jobs. This was below expectations and took some of the sting out of Thursday's hot ADP employment data.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in June from 3.7% in May. Wages also continue to spike, rising 4.4% year over year and matching the pace from the previous two months. This can be bad, because rising wages contribute to inflation.</p>
<p>There will be further inflation data released in the coming week, with the June consumer price index due Wednesday and the producer price index coming the next day. So far, data has not been soft enough to dampen Fed enthusiasm for further rate hikes.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough, earnings season is set to begin. As ever, the big banks will take center stage first, with the likes of <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM" target="_blank">JPM</a>), <strong>Citigroup</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C" target="_blank">C</a>) and <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> (<a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC" target="_blank">WFC</a>) reporting Friday.</p>

<h2>Energy Stock Market Groups Shine</h2>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the session mixed. Energy and materials led the upside while health and consumer staples were the worst-performing areas.</p>
<p>The performance of the IBD industry groups added further insight into the day's stock market action.</p>
<p>A number of oil &amp; gas groups, including drillers and field services, solar stocks and agricultural chemical plays were the best performers.</p>
<p>On the flip side, specialty consumer product plays, diversified medical stocks and water utilities were the worst laggards.</p>

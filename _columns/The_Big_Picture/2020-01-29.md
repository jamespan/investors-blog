The stock market was in rally mode for a good portion of Wednesday's session. But sellers came in late after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-rates-bond-buys-steady-dow-jones-rises/) plans to slow Treasury purchases in the second quarter. Known as quantitative easing, bond buying by the Fed has helped keep interest rates low.




Intraday gains of 0.5% to 0.8% for the major stock indexes faded by the close. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq ended with gains of less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq closed in the bottom half of its intraday range in higher volume, resulting in a stalling session. Stalling counts as [distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/). NYSE volume came in slightly lower than Tuesday, according to preliminary data.


Small caps were notable laggards, with the Russell 2000 down 0.55%.


The Philadelphia semiconductor index was volatile again. After reversing sharply off its high Friday, the index gapped down Monday, falling 3.9%. It bounced 2.4% Tuesday but fell another 1.8% Wednesday. [Chip stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) were pressured Wednesday, hurt by a 6% decline in shares of **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). But AMD stock closed near its session high and continued to hold above its 10-week moving average. Late Tuesday, AMD's earnings and sales slightly topped expectations, but [its Q1 sales outlook was light](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q4-2019-amd-stock/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP_4x3_012920-252x300.jpg)The stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend, but the risk level is still elevated. The outbreak of the coronavirus remains a headwind. In addition, money has been flowing into bonds lately. The 10-year Treasury yield fell another 8 basis points Wednesday to around 1.58%. That's down sharply from a high of 1.94% in late December. Bonds soared Monday when the Nasdaq plunged 1.9%.


But the stock market still has a lot going for it, including a healthy U.S. economy and an accommodative Federal Reserve.


As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday left its key lending rate unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75%. But the recent outbreak of the coronavirus has put the possibility of another rate cut this year back on the table. It's still a small chance at this point, but higher than it was before the coronavirus outbreak.


But what trumps some market headwinds for now is the overall action in leading growth stocks. A look inside the IBD 50 and [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) reveals plenty of healthy stock charts â€” stocks holding above buy points after breakouts and plenty more finding support after breakouts.


Examples include **Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). Plenty of other top-rated growth stocks are near buy points including **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **PennyMac Financial** ([PFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFSI)), **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) and **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)).


And after-hours trading showed plenty of big earnings winners, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)), **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Tesla and ServiceNow are [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks. Cirrus Logic and Qorvo are Apple suppliers.


Apple Earnings
--------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) dominated the headlines in the Dow Jones after reporting [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q1-2020-apple-stock/) Thursday. It was a very strong report by all accounts, helped by news that iPhone sales totaled $56 billion in the quarter, well above expectations. Apple hit another new high Wednesday, but the stock isn't buyable now after a huge price run since a breakout from a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) in September.


Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed a big drop in bullish sentiment in the latest week. The bulls dropped to 52.8% from 59.4%. It's a contrarian indicator in which readings of over 60% for bulls have come ahead of market pullbacks in the past. The thinking is that when everyone is bullish about the market, it's time to be bearish.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Wednesday's session delivered a couple of breakouts. **Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)) jumped past a 72.098 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Even more compelling, it broke out of a longer consolidation that started all the way back in March.


**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), meanwhile, reclaimed a 43.62 buy point after some volatile price action. Earnings are due Feb. 13 after the close.

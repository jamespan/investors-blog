Stock Indexes Start Off Ugly, Then Trim Much Of Loss
=====================================================

Stocks took a pounding Friday until a final-hour rally reduced the damage.

  

The Nasdaq lost 0.4% after being down 1% earlier, while the S&P 500 turned a 1.2% dent into a 0.6% ding. The IBD 50 fell 0.2%.

  

Volume rose narrowly on both major exchanges.

  

The day's action constituted distribution and brought the count up to an uncomfortable level. Distribution involves a significant loss in rising volume in a major index. It's the footprint of fund selling.

  

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average sank below their 50-day lines, just one day after both had regained those lines.

  

While the indexes may be headed for a familiar 4% to 11% pullback that was common last year, there's no guarantee things will either get there or stop there.

  

Some bulls, especially if they are largely sitting in cash, might welcome a deeper pullback that shakes out more investors.

  

If this pullback proves typical, then the decline has further to go.

  

A pullback to the 200-day moving average, which the Nasdaq experienced in October, would take the index about 8.5% off its recent high.

  

The current market has several uncertainties to deal with. They include:

  

•A strong dollar: If the U.S. currency stays strong, this could be a problem for companies with hefty international exposure. Retailers, small caps and midcaps, however, might handle it better. In general, small caps and midcaps have less exposure to international markets than big caps do. Also, the retail space has plenty of companies that derive most of their revenue from the U.S. market.

  

In the past week, **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)), **Ann** ([ANN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANN)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) logged big gains.

  

•Cheap oil: Much of the damage from low oil prices may be done. Oil company stocks are far off their highs. Beneficiaries of low gasoline prices include consumers. (Again, this points to retail.) Major oil importers, such as India, also are benefiting.

  

Seven of the top 40 industry groups in Friday's IBD were in retail. And the iPath **MSCI India Index** ([INP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INP)), the benchmark India exchange-traded note, is up about 6% this year.

  

•Interest rates: Banks might benefit if the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates in June or September, as expected.

  

Here, investors haven't seen much stock reaction, other than modest gains from IBD 50 stock **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)).

  

Stocks mentioned here aren't buy recommendations. Some still have spotty fundamentals.

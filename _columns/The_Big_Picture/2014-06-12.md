============================================================

Bears came out in force for the first time in more than three weeks, swatting the stock indexes lower.

  

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The IBD 50 skidded 1%.

  

Volume rose across the board.

  

Below-average volume has been a trend lately, but NYSE trade was above average Thursday. Nasdaq trade was up vs. Wednesday but below its average.

  

Still, Thursday's price and volume action constituted distribution, which points to institutional selling. The Nasdaq incurred its first day of distribution since the uptrend was confirmed May 27. The S&P 500's count is at two, thanks to stalling Monday.

  

Despite the ugly action Thursday, the uptrend remains intact.

  

Market watchers had no shortage of explanations for the selling.

  

First-time jobless claims were worse than expected. Retail sales for May fell short of views (though April's figure was revised up sharply). Chaos in Iraq raised anxiety and boosted oil prices.

  

Perhaps the simplest explanation is profit taking: At Tuesday's close, the Nasdaq was up about 10% from its April 15 low. Taking some money off the table after a good run is prudent and needn't signal the end of an uptrend.

  

Although the bears hadn't done much lately until Thursday, there are signs that they've been building short positions for months.

  

The NYSE short interest ratio began hitting five-year highs Tuesday.

  

This secondary indicator, more often than not, acts as a contrarian gauge, and that's how it worked the last time around. The last time the NYSE short interest ratio began making five-year highs was Sept. 12. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose about 14% and 10% over the next four months.

  

This indicator, however, is out of sync with Investor's Intelligence's bulls vs. bears gauge, which is hinting at a market top.

  

Which is right?

  

The best way to find an answer to that question is to track the price and volume action of the major indexes. Right now, they have yet to signal that this uptrend is over.

  

However, some stock groups do have a suddenly sick look. The airline stocks were hit very hard the past two days.**American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) has given back almost all of a recent 11% gain. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) is heading toward its 10-week line in fast trade. **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) is 16% above a 22.20 entry in a flat base; it was up 25%. Each shows action that could justify a sell.

  

Although the indexes suffered Thursday, they did rally off the day's lows in strong volume in the final 20 minutes. That sets Friday up as a battleground for the bulls and the bears.

Resilience was the operative word Monday as major averages ended with small gains after a weak open.

  

Stocks were spooked early as weak manufacturing data in China and clashes in Ukraine weighed.

  

The Nasdaq fell 0.9% early but started rallying back in the first hour of trading. It ended with a gain of 0.3%. The S&P 500 rallied 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE fell 14% from Friday, while Nasdaq trading fell 15%.

  

The IBD 50 outperformed and rose for the fifth straight session. The index of leading growth stocks gained 0.8%.

  

Stock market headlines in recent weeks have offered up a variety of opinions about underlying market health. One headline Monday read: "Bull market will 'end badly' but still has a long way to go."

  

What's known right now is that the market remains in a correction, even with the S&P 500 so close to an all-time high. The index has been consolidating gains for just over four weeks after hitting an intraday high of 1897 in early April.

  

The Nasdaq, meanwhile, is 14 days into a rally attempt that started on April 15, when it bounced off its 200-day moving average. It's still below its 50-day moving average but only 5% off its high.

  

**Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) led IBD's Auto Manufacturers industry group to a 2% gain. Shares of the luxury electric-car maker rose nearly 3% in light trade ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close. It's expected to deliver its fifth straight profitable quarter with earnings of 10 cents a share. Sales are expected to rise 24% to $699.1 million.

  

The biotech group also had a good day, up 1.5%. **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) continued work on a late-stage base, rising nearly 2% in soft turnover. Early Monday, the company announced a partnership with Avalanche Biotechnologies to develop next-generation gene therapy products in ophthalmology. Earnings from Regeneron are due Thursday before the open.

  

As market bulls wait for a follow-through day to confirm a new uptrend, there is a lot of base-building going on, which is encouraging.

  

Institutional-quality names such as **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS))and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) continue to consolidate gains.

  

Kors capped its fifth straight gain Monday, but note that volume has been shrinking during its recent upswing. Facebook, meanwhile, is still below its 50-day moving average after recently pulling back as much as 24% off its high. That might sound like a big pullback, but it's reasonable when the left side of a cup-shaped pattern forms.

  

**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) extended gains Monday after reporting solid earnings last week. It's back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a cup-type pattern.

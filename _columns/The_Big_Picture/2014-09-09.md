The market's focus was on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) for most of Tuesday's session, but attention turned to weakness in the broad market by the close as institutional selling made its presence felt.


The sell-off accelerated in the final two hours of trading. The Nasdaq, weighed down by Apple, lost 0.9%. The S&P fell 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.6%.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq, giving both indexes their second distribution day.


It was an ugly close for the market, but not because investors were fearful. The put-call volume ratio registered a tame reading of 0.78. Readings that are above 1.0 indicate excessive fear and have been seen at market bottoms in the past, but we're not there yet.


Jitters about rising interest rates were also blamed for the selling. Yields aren't going through the roof, but they have been heading decidedly higher. On Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.50%. In mid-August, the yield was at 2.34%.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE and Nasdaq by more than 3 to 1. The IBD 50 underperformed, falling 1.4%. Weakness in Chinese names like **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) and **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) hurt the IBD 50.


A 5% gain for Apple turned into a loss of 0.4% by the close after the company unveiled new versions of the iPhone, a digital wallet and the Apple Watch.


Volume in Apple shares totaled just over 189 million shares, the largest for a down day since late January. Apple briefly pierced its 50-day moving average but closed just above the line.


The stock market has several factors working in its favor, although it's still a market where institutional investors could start taking profits at any time. Even though they were the driving force behind the selling Tuesday, most leaders are holding up relatively well.


Distribution days are still contained and are no cause for immediate alarm. Still, it's important to be proactive with current holdings. Being patient with lackluster movers wouldn't be the best of strategies if distribution days continue to make their presence felt.


Market bulls are comforted by the fact that the Fed is in no rush to raise interest rates, even though the FOMC could decide to start raising rates sooner than expected. But the Fed knows full well that if it raises rates too soon and too fast, it could impede the U.S. economic recovery.


The Fed's next meeting is slated for Sept. 16-17.


After the close, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) reported strong earnings.


The company reported a profit of 11 cents a share, in line with views. Revenue jumped 59% to $178.2 million, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $161.25 million. Bullish guidance fueled a 4% gain for the stock in after-hours trading.


IBD Sector Leader **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) reports Wednesday after the close. A recent restructuring has the company back in growth mode. But the stock has come under pressure lately.

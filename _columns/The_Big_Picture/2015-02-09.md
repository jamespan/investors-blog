Stocks fell for a second straight session Monday, but lower volume suggested institutional investors didn't sell in droves.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 0.4% each. Both found support at the 50-day moving average, at least for the moment.


Both still remain in big trading ranges from late December. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have backed off after hitting resistance near 4775 and 2065 respectively.


The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5% and the small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.8%. Meanwhile, the IBD 50 slumped 1%, with 41 of its stocks lower.


More Greek drama pressured stocks Monday. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras again vowed to reverse austerity measures. Eurogroup finance ministers will meet Wednesday to discuss Greece's financing needs at an emergency session in Brussels.


Weak trade figures from China didn't help either. The world's second-largest economy reported exports fell 3.3% in January from a year ago, while imports dived nearly 20%.


Decliners beat winners by nearly 7-to-5 on the NYSE and about 5-to-3 on the Nasdaq. Volume dropped off sharply on both major exchanges from Friday's heavy pace. The lower trade helped the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 dodge a distribution day, which was positive. But overall, the choppy market environment continued.


Monday's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/738333-how-to-play-choppy-market.htm) outlined a number of ways for handling trendless markets. One key point that may be overlooked by some investors is that it's fine to be in cash and wait for market conditions to improve before buying stocks. Investors don't have to be in the market all the time.


When positive factors are at hand, that's the time that investors should be putting money to work in leading stocks. Right now, there aren't many out there.


Distribution remains at elevated levels. Leaders have shown mixed action at best. Many have cleared buy points, but those making double-digit gains have been few.


Airline stocks sputtered Monday as oil prices climbed for a third straight session. **United Continental** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)), **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) and **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) were all off by 3% to 4%.


On a brighter note, **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) cleared a 156.07 buy point in a four-weeks-tight.

  These Growth Stocks Make Surprising Gains As Market Outlook Shifts

In baseball, when your leadoff hitter gets plenty of bat on the ball and strokes a single or double, you generally get the feeling that the inning is going to go well. Tuesday's action in the stadium of stocks seemed to embody such psychology.




In recent years, IBD readers have not seen many days in which the likes of **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) (up 3%), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) (up 1.4%) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) (up 4% at the session high) had gains that smothered the major indexes. But [solid earnings results](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/jpmorgan-earnings-citigroup-goldman-sachs-earnings-q3-2019/) and the continuation of mild top-line increases spurred a day of institutional accumulation in these companies.


While JPMorgan gapped up at the open and thrust back above a 117.34 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a shallow six-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), Citigroup (EPS up 20%) garnered its fifth straight advance and hoisted itself back above a 70.84 entry in an equally mild cup with handle.


Wells Fargo (EPS down 5%) recently retook its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The new challenge: clearing a 51.51 buy point in a [first-stage bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/).

New Outlook As Many Growth Stocks Rise
--------------------------------------


The strength in bank shares helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.9% and the NYSE financial index 1.1%. But nonbanking stocks enjoyed an even stronger ride up. The Nasdaq 100 gained 1.3% while the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 marched 1.2% higher.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MP101519-214x300.jpg)The S&P 500 got help not only from banks and techs. Thanks in part to bargain hunters in managed care, biotech, RVs and specialty consumer products (think cannabis), the large-cap benchmark gained 1% and nearly closed above 3000.


Now trading just 1.1% below its all-time peak of 3027, the S&P 500 is certainly acting a lot better than it had in the last few weeks of the third quarter. Back then, not a few institutional investors openly wondered if the U.S.-China trade war would tip the American economy into a recession.


Thus, Tuesday's upgrade in IBD's market outlook back to a confirmed uptrend acknowledges the improved tone in stocks. This means investors can start adding more top-quality stocks rising to buy areas.


Volume climbed sharply on both exchanges. As a daily chart of the Nasdaq composite shows, turnover on Monday was dead-quiet, typical for Columbus Day. So with the rush of earnings news coming in, higher volume was likely a given for Tuesday.


[Looking at the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), few stocks actually moved up or down in above-average trade.


Ditto for [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


Stock Market Internals Today
----------------------------


Yet on the positive side, the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 improved to a C-. For weeks, both indexes showed a D rating even as the market saw the Aug. 13 follow-through further away in its rear-view mirror.


See the rating in the big daily charts found within the General Market Indicators PDF page at the bottom of this column.


Inside the daily chart of the 500, you'll also see that while the NYSE advance-decline line continues to rise gradually. Yet the number of stocks in the IBD database with an E Accumulation Rating (567) still outweighs the 397 stocks that hold a stellar A grade.


The latest report on stocks making new highs still shows a tame number: 56 on the NYSE, 55 on the Nasdaq. Still, that total of 111 issues making 52-week or all-time peaks well exceeds the 55 stocks that sank to new lows.


Click on "New Highs" in the above report, and you'll see the Building and Retail sectors dominate the new highs list. Building recently climbed to No. 1 among 33 sectors that make up IBD's [stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-15-2019/).


Beyond Growth Stocks: Still A Concern
-------------------------------------


As the Market Pulse shows, the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) remains high.


It's going to take either time or a few more strong advances like the one we saw Tuesday before any of the seven distribution days on the S&P 500 and six on the Nasdaq get snuffed out.


In terms of time, it takes a minimum 25 trading sessions before a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) expires.


This means it won't be until the end of the Oct. 25 session — eight trading days from now — before the Sept. 20 institutional sell-off on the S&P 500 gets cut.


IBD's three semiconductor industry groups — fabless, manufacturing and equipment — all outperformed the major averages with gains in the 2% to 2.5% range. (See the daily gains and losses of all 197 industry groups via [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Dutch chip lithography systems giant **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) reports Q3 results before the open on Wednesday. [The Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) has enjoyed a 14% advance since clearing a 234.60 buy point in a five-week flat base.


Keep in mind, though, that even the best stocks can repeat that old Wall Street saw, "Buy on the rumor, sell on the news." That's why even in a confirmed uptrend, making buys based on rules and not gut feelings is critical to long-term success in [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 2.2% and hit new highs.


When To Buy, When Not To Buy
----------------------------



**PagSeguro Digital** ([PAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAGS)) suffered a deep loss, falling more than 19% at one point. Volume soared nine times above its 50-day average. The big move illustrated why it's prudent to avoid buying shares in a stock before it's completed a base.


Besides [announcing a share offering](https://www.investors.com/news/payments-stock-pagseguro-digital-plunges-secondary-stock-offering/), the payments technology expert in Brazil issued preliminary quarterly results that apparently did not please Wall Street.


At Tuesday's session low of 37.15, PagSeguro saw its rally from a prior breakout at 31.74 shrink to 17%. At the August peak of 53.43, the gain had reached 68%.

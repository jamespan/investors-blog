The stock market delivered another bullish day of gains Monday, helped by plenty of merger activity, along with optimism that a vote in Congress on the GOP tax bill could come as early as Tuesday.


The Nasdaq composite crossed the 7000 level during the session but closed below it. The Dow Jones industrial average has its sights set on 25,000.




 Remember back in the day when FANG stocks used to outperform the Nasdaq by a wide margin on a strong up session? Well, that wasn't the case Monday as shares of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) performed mostly in-line with the market, while **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) lagged.


Money flowed out of bonds, lifting the 1o-year Treasury yield higher by 4 basis points to 2.39%.


The Nasdaq composite added 0.8%, the Dow rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 gained 0.5%. The  Russell 2000 popped 1.2% and came to within 7 points of its all-time high. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in well below Friday's levels, but volume was skewed higher Friday due to options expiration.


High-yielding utility names lagged as money flowed into growth stocks. The [IBD 50](http://www.innovatoretfs.com/etf/?ticker=ffty) outperformed, rising 1.7% as 18 names in the index of leading growth stocks rose 2% or more.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) was a top performer in the IBD 50, up nearly 5%, as the stock continues to show supporting action at the 10-week moving average. Note that support is coming after a recent breakout from a riskier late-stage base.


Fellow IBD 50 name **YY Inc**. ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) also outperformed, rising 4%, but it's extended after a second bounce off the 10-week line after a breakout from a cup-shaped base in late September.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP121817-210x300.png)The bears will say that tax reform is setting up to be a classic "sell the news" situation because major stock indexes have rallied sharply in expectations that a deal will get done.


It's certainly possible, but the bulls maintain that a big tax cut for corporations will fuel a boom in corporate earnings and result in more economic growth. And if interest rates stay low due to subdued inflation, that could spell more activity in the [IPO](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and M&A markets. All of these scenarios are good arguments for more upside in 2018. Of course, the bulls also the like the fact that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are comfortably above their 50-day moving average lines.


So what do to do now? If you're still holding some nice gainers in 2017, give them room to work, but don't be afraid to cut bait if signs of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) start to crop up. But the market uptrend still deserves respect, which means that looking for occasional new buys make sense.


There are still plenty of healthy-looking stock charts out there. Just be careful not to get lulled into a heavy-volume breakout early, only to see volume fade badly by the close.


Positive sentiment early Monday was helped by news of a couple of acquisitions. **Hershey** ([HSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY)) snatched up **Amplify Snack Brands** ([BETR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BETR)) for $1.6 billion including debt. Shares of Amplify surged nearly 72%. Elsewhere, **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) agreed to buy snack company **Snyder's-Lance** ([LNCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNCE)) for around $4.8 billion. Shares of Snyder's jumped 7%. Snyder's is known for its pretzels and Cape Cod potato chips.


Inside the Dow, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) added 1.4% to 176.42. It cleared a 176.34 entry from a base-on-base pattern, but volume was unimpressive.


Also in the Dow, **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) price action has been uncanny in light of selling in the chip space lately. Intel was the best percentage gainer in the Dow, rising nearly 4%.


While market leaders like **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) are stuck below their 50-day moving averages, Intel continues to be a picture of strength after bouncing off the 50-day line Friday.


In the semiconductor space, **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) gapped out of a flat base with a 110.11 buy point, rising 5% to 111.22 in soft turnover. Last week, the trade group SEMI said that good times will continue for the [semiconductor equipment market](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/chip-gear-sales-forecast-to-post-records-this-year-and-next/) for at least another year.


Shares of China-based **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) soared 39% on news of a [big investment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vipshop-soars-on-863-million-investment-from-tencent-jd-com/)  from **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)) and **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)).


After a soft start, **CSX Corp**. ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) fought back to a positive finish and is getting support so far at the 50-day line. The railroad operator extended losses early Monday on news that highly regarded CEO Hunter Harrison died. Shares plunged 8% Friday after CSX said Harrison was taking a medical leave due to unexpected complications from a recent illness.

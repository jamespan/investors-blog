Stock Market Finishes Mixed After Powell Talk, But Some Emerging Leaders Show Ugly Reversals
=============================================================================================

Amid a mixed showing by key equity indexes Wednesday, the stock market concealed serious carnage among some leaders.




While the IBD outlook for stocks remains in the best-possible shape — namely a confirmed uptrend — some nasty reversals across growth stocks should give readers enough reason to tread carefully with new buys for now.


The rebound in megacap techs has remained intact, although recent gains have been much more muted. Just look at the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund. QQQ edged up 0.2%. But at one point it rose as much as 0.8%. So, even though the ETF hit another new all-time high, the action was somewhat disappointing.


The Nasdaq composite edged 0.2% lower, but volume fell modestly vs. the prior session.


Stock Market Divergence
-----------------------


![MP071421_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MP071421_2-217x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the S&P 500 actually recorded a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), a rare form of distribution. A 0.1% gain to 4374 meant that the large-cap benchmark closed in the lower half of its intraday trading range. Volume rose on the NYSE vs. Tuesday. So, the action hinted that fund managers sold into strength, distributing shares to the masses.


Also, small caps had an awful session. This diverges with the seemingly bullish fact that the large-cap indexes posted new all-time highs.


The Market Pulse highlights a number of leading stocks that have gotten pummeled after trying to break out.


Perhaps one of the most dramatic declines on Wednesday? Just see **Global-E Online** ([GLBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLBE)).


The e-commerce platform and May IPO tried to clear a [high, tight flag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-tesla-stock-rally-high-tight-flag-base/) with a 64.60 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). This [key chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) is rare, even just to form one. Rarer still? The ones that actually work. Global-E Online powered into new highs before reversing to an ugly 8% loss in the heaviest turnover since June 11.


**Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)), **Bill.com** ([BILL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILL)) and **Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)) also offer more examples of how recent breakout attempts have turned into smackdowns — at least for a day.


The first two names were discussed in [Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


Small Caps Thumped, Again
-------------------------


Meanwhile, please check out the advance-decline line of the Nasdaq, plotted beneath the price bars of the composite index's large daily chart on the General Market Indicators PDF page at the bottom of this story. A curious divergence has been brewing.


The A-D line tracks the number of stocks rising in price vs. those falling on a daily basis. Over the past three weeks, the Nasdaq composite itself has floated to new highs. You'd really like to see the advance-decline line follow suit. But it hasn't lately.


The NYSE's A-D line (see it below the S&P 500's big daily chart) has moved sideways for the past five weeks.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF slumped 1.5%, ending virtually at its session low. At 218.89, the ETF made its lowest close since May 19. A rebound back above the useful technical level, the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), on Friday ultimately did not lead to a meaningful rebound.


Midcap stocks showed weakness too. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) fund dropped nearly 0.6%.



As you can see on a daily chart, the midcap ETF has made no new price progress since hitting a new high of 507 on April 29.


The disappointing session comes during the first week of quarterly results. So far, nice earnings growth reports by the likes of **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and other major Wall Street banks have not stimulated the bulls. All three stocks have been moving sideways for months, carving [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


Certainly, these lenders and dozens of others deserve a break. They've made uncommonly big gains since November, clearing buy points within deep bottoming bases.


Will Bank Stocks Take A Longer Break?
-------------------------------------



David Keller, chief market strategist at Redmond, Wash.-based StockCharts.com, told IBD that financial stocks within the S&P 500 actually began to show signs of rolling over in early May. In other words, the breadth of leadership among the banks "had already been showing signs of deteriorating before the earnings season began," Keller noted.


Keller spent years as a managing director of research at Fidelity Investments covering sentiment trends, technical analysis and other areas of research. At StockCharts.com, he assesses the ratio of bullishness vs. bearishness among the components of a specific industry based in part on analyzing point-and-figure charts. These charts historically proved popular among floor traders in the futures markets as a way to spot price patterns and relative strength.


Looking at the relative strength index technical indicator for this group, however, Keller notes that recent declines may have sent the sector into a short-term oversold position. The RSI fell below the typically oversold level of 30 three weeks ago.


Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury markets continued to maintain a recent flattening trend following hours of testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before Congress' House Financial Services committee. Powell emphasized that the U.S. central bank would be transparent about the time in which it would slow down its huge monthly purchases of debt securities.


These purchases have helped keep the cost of money ultra low.


Buying returned to the benchmark 10-year government bond for the first time in four sessions. The key yield sank 6 basis points to 1.35%.


The Fed holds its next meeting on interest rate policy on July 27-28.

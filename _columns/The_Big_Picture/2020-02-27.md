The stock market correction deepened Thursday, as the major stock indexes sold off sharply on worsening coronavirus news. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dove 4.6%, closing at the session's lows.




Meanwhile, the S&P 500 faltered 4.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also descended 4.4%, or 1,190 points. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 3.5%. Leading growth stocks were also hit hard; the IBD 50 fell 4.4%. Volume on both main exchanges soared above Wednesday's session, indicating big institutional selling.

Stock Market Correction Deepens
-------------------------------


On Tuesday, IBD [downgraded the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) from an uptrend under pressure to a market in correction. The major indexes reached new correction lows with their sharp losses Thursday. Because of the new correction, investors should mostly be on the sidelines, in cash. The Nasdaq reached the correction level, falling more than 12% off its 52-week high.


The Cboe Market Volatility Index (or VIX) surged more than 20% above its 10-day moving average. In fact, the VIX is more than 68% above its 10-day line, indicating the fear in this stock market is severe. A jump of this magnitude can help confirm a low in the market. This [technical sentiment indicator](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) tries to measure the amount of fear in the stock market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MP022720-274x300.jpg)Meanwhile, the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) hit 1.21, above the key 1.15 level for the first time since early October. A reading above 1.15 can help confirm a low in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Keep in mind the VIX and the put-call ratio are secondary indicators, and don't take precedence over the price and volume action of the indexes. For now, the clear trend is lower.


Investors should be focusing on updating their watch lists and keeping their powder dry. Don't tune out; remember, a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) — and a new potential uptrend — is as few as four trading sessions away once a major index makes a low.


Top Stocks To Watch: Nvidia, StoneCo, Square, Zoom Video
--------------------------------------------------------


Many stock market leaders have given up their support levels in recent sessions, like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). [Clear breaks of the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume are key defensive signals, especially after a sustained uptrend. But others are trying to hold their support levels and even break out above proper buy points. These names could be [potential stock market leaders](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) once the overall market is able to steady itself.


Top stocks to watch include **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and **Zoom** **Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)). Nvidia is still clinging to its 50-day moving average after Thursday's 5.6% decline.


StoneCo is fighting to hold its 50-day moving average line. The Brazilian payment stock gained 0.7% and is in the early stages of a new formation. The stock's [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) made a new recent high Thursday. StoneCo reports earnings Monday after the close.


Square surged as much as 12.2% before closing with a 3.5% gain. The stock received a boost from Wednesday's strong [Q4 earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/square-earnings-sq-stock-q42019/). The stock is trying to retake an 82.20 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) after a failed breakout above that level.


Zoom Video broke out past a 107.44 buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), according to [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Shares rallied more than 6% Thursday. Zoom stock [was featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-zoom-video-stock-break-out-new-buy-point/) in this week's [IPO Leaders story.](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/)


All new buys are considered very risky during stock market corrections, but these leaders are still showing strength in a very difficult market environment.

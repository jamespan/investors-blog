Stocks Put In Big Rally, But Volume Is Light
=============================================

Stocks put in a solid rally Monday, marking an improvement from the choppy action of recent sessions.

  

Thanks to a rebound in software stocks and gains in major components **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the Nasdaq popped 1.8%.

  

Monday's jump matched a 1.8% surge on Jan. 30 and brought the tech-heavy index back closer to its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100, which excludes financials, rose a milder 1.6% but regained its 50-day line.

  

The S&P 500 rallied 1% to a record closing high but missed its April 4 record high by a tiny margin. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.7% to an all-time high. Meanwhile, the IBD 50 surged 2.1%.

  

News of several deals — including **Hillshire Brands** ([HSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSH)) buying **Pinnacle Foods** ([PF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PF)) — and China's pledge to move ahead with capital market reforms lifted Wall Street's mood.

  

Unlike the indecisive action of the past few sessions, stocks showed much better price action Monday. They opened higher and were strong all day. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed just fractions off their session highs.

  

Investor appetite for risky assets appeared to have returned. The small-cap Russell 2000 bolted 2.4%, putting it back above its 200-day moving average. Utilities, which are defensive plays, were among the day's worst-performing industry groups.

  

Breadth was solid, with winners trouncing losers by about 4 to 1 on the Nasdaq and nearly 4 to 1 on the NYSE. But volume was lower on both major exchanges from Friday's pace, which had already dropped off sharply from Thursday's levels. The lower turnover put a damper on an otherwise strong day for the market, which remains in a correction.

  

The level of volume behind a price move is a good indication of conviction among professional investors such as mutual funds and hedge funds. Whether it's the general market or an individual stock, price action is a lot more meaningful when it's accompanied by strong turnover.

  

Nearly every stock in the IBD 50 rose, but the majority climbed in below-average trading.

  

**United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) and **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) both cleared buy points from flat bases. But their volume was below average.

  

Big volume is key whenever a stock makes a significant price move, although sometimes volume arrives a few days later.

  

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) cleared a 42.59 entry from a three-weeks-tight pattern in volume slightly below average.

  

But **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) climbed 2% in nearly twice its average trade. The stock, which was No. 21 in Monday's IBD 50, has been under heavy accumulation in spite of a choppy market.

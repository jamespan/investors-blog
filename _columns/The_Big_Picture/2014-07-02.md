The major stock indexes on Wednesday held on to practically all of the prior day's hefty gains. But some market leaders showed buttery fingers.


The S&P 500 edged 1 point higher, adding to Tuesday's 0.7% rally. The Nasdaq composite slipped less than 1 point. Volume cratered lower ahead of the three-day July 4th holiday. Thursday's trading session will end three hours early.


A big boost in the ADP monthly private-sector payrolls, up 281,000 last month vs. the consensus forecast of 213,000, didn't help the market sustain its recent advance. The Nasdaq was up 2.5% over a five-session span through Tuesday.


Small caps had a rougher day. The S&P 600 SmallCap index fell 0.6%; the Russell 2000 lost 0.5%.


Looking at individual sectors, the Transport-Airline group slumped nearly 3%. Since June 12, **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) has been spending more time below its 50-day moving average than above it. **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) fell 5% and punched below its 50-day line in more than double normal volume after it reported weakness in international yields.


The IBD 50 was flat. Yet at least 18 of its members fell 1% or more. Giving back some gains is perfectly acceptable. On Wednesday, virtually no outright sell signals were triggered.


An investor can and should sit tight when a top dog gets clawed with a 2% loss — or even 4% or so — for a day, then settles down. But one's holding strategy should change if a pattern of significant declines in heavy volume persists.


Overall, the market's internals continue to look sound.


The NYSE advance-decline hints at growing participation in the current rally. This line has been sloping higher — meaning that more stocks are rising than falling — since February.


On the Nasdaq, the advance-decline line has risen sharply for six weeks. It turned higher slightly ahead of the Nasdaq's May 27 follow-through.


The Nasdaq's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has rebounded to a neutral C grade.


Of course, this grade has been skewed somewhat by a pair of up days that showed unusually heavily volume. First was the June 20 quadruple witching session of expiring options and futures, in which the Nasdaq rose just 0.2%. Just five sessions later, the Nasdaq rallied 0.4% after the annual rebalancing of the Russell indexes evidently triggered a last-minute tidal wave of trading.


The put-call volume ratio remains in normal range. The bulls-bears weekly survey by Investors Intelligence showed slightly less optimism vs. the prior week.

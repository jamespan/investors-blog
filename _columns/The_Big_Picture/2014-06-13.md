Stocks Stay Calm, Add Gains; Several Leaders Still In Bases
============================================================

Stocks strolled ahead in quiet volume Friday, keeping their composure a day after some heavy selling.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 added 0.3% each. The IBD 50 rose 0.2%.


Volume fell across the board, which might've been partly tied to caution in advance of the Federal Reserve's meeting set for Tuesday and Wednesday.


In the wake of Thursday's distribution day, bulls had a simple goal: avoid another sell-off. This was accomplished, though the fading volume suggested the action was more of a rest than a repair.


While the distribution count is low, the market already had two distribution days going into Friday's session. Early in the week, the S&P 500 suffered stalling, which is a subtle form of distribution that occurs on an up day.


Had Friday delivered a third day of distribution for the week, it would've been hard for the bulls to stay calm.


Although the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended winning streaks of four and three weeks respectively, some areas of the market continued to show muscle. Oil stocks had no problems. The U.S. explorers and producers group rose for a fifth straight week.


For the week ended Friday, the oil explorer group advanced 3%. Gold miners also were strong, popping about 8% for the week. The gold stocks, though, are beaten down, whereas many energy stocks are making new highs.


Another area of strength is semiconductors. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose for a seventh week in a row.


While action was slow Friday, many top stocks are forming cup bases. Some share the same sector.


For example, restaurant chains **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) are building the right side of cup structures.


Apparel plays **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) are climbing cups. Kors' pattern has already added a handle.


Paper providers **KapStone Paper** ([KS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KS)) and **Packaging Corp. of America** ([PKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKG)) are working on possible handles in cup patterns.


Medical sector stocks **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) are in cup-with-handle bases. Both are late stage.


Alcoholic beverage maker **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) has sketched a shallow cup with handle. Data center hardware maker **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) has formed a base with a possible early entry at 112.94.


IPO **Zoey's Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)) broke out during the week, but it has yet to turn an annual profit.


Economic news was thin Friday with the Producer Price Index unexpectedly slipping 0.2% and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey missing views. Chaos grew in Iraq, but the market and even oil prices were relatively nonchalant.


For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.2%. The S&P 500 and the IBD 50 lost 0.7% each.

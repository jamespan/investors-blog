title: Stocks Fall In Mixed Trade, But How Much Of It Was Apple's Fault?

The market doth not live by Apple alone.


While a sell-off in shares of one of the undoubtedly greatest growth companies of the 21st century helped trigger a down day for stocks overall, the general decline in higher volume wasn't exactly the type that should have the bears slapping paws and licking their chops -- at least not yet.


True, the market's rally since its 2009 low or 2011 low (you choose) is still very long in the tooth. Yet Thursday's action did not change the overall course of the current trend, which is still up.



The lack of excitement over a water-resistant Apple Watch and a headphone jack-free iPhone unveiled on Wednesday translated into a 2.6% drop in heavy trade for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), its worst day since a 2.8% gap down on June 28, which came ahead of its sour fiscal Q3 results several weeks later (EPS down 22%, sales off 15%). The poor action, in turn, hurt the Nasdaq composite, falling nearly 0.5%.


Volume on the all-electronic exchange fell, despite a more than 10-million-share boost in Apple trading volume.


The S&P 500's 0.2% drop in higher volume also counted as distribution, its sixth over the past 25 trading sessions. The Nasdaq's distribution count remains at 3.


Normally, all it takes is five or six distribution days within a short period of time to kill a bull market. But as this column has noted frequently this year, the strength of the selling matters just as much. Looking at the S&P 500, the past five distribution days showed declines of -0.5%, -0.5%,-0.2%, -0.2%, and Thursday's -0.2 drop. In other words, the sell-offs have lacked real teeth.


True, certain sectors are getting their teeth knocked out. Biotech shares are still licking their wounds. Investors may fear that a Hillary Clinton presidency would deal another blow to the industry due to controversial pricing policies. In the golden age of e-commerce, many brick-and-mortar retailers are still miles below their 52-week and all-time highs. The falling-knife action in **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)), down 17% in huge trade on soft sales guidance, provides enough color.


![MP090816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MP090816-1-191x300.jpg)However, bull markets can thrive longer than the crowd thinks. Why is that?


One answer: sector rotation. The most bullish action on Thursday came in the futures pits, as West Texas Intermediate crude oil soared 4% to more than $47 a barrel. New data showed that crude oil supplies fell hard in the latest week, giving beaten down oil exploration stocks a sorely needed shot in the arm.


The NYSE composite, packed with oil, coal and related energy plays, closed virtually flat on Thursday. On an industry group basis, oil drilling, machinery, U.S. exploration, royalty trust and coal stocks all gained 2% or more.


Rotation may not be limited to the energy patch. Consider that banks have been outright leaders in IBD's **[daily screened new high list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-sep-07-2016/)**. Judging by the 4% rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to 1.6% on Thursday, are investors preparing for a potential rate hike later in the year?


Another answer: The crowd is far from being over-optimistic.


When the Nasdaq composite scored an all-time high of 5271 on Aug. 15, did you and your neighbors cheer and go to the bar and celebrate? Did the local bar have CNBC on the television? Probably not. Similarly today, the mood on Wall Street and Main Street still lies somewhere between morose pessimism and outright giddiness.


Case in point: a look at the various sentiment gauges that are now part of IBD's new **[Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/)** feature suggests that there is still potential for some investors to deploy cash into stocks. For instance, the margin debt ratio shows a 2% year-over-year decline in July, while the put-call volume ratio of 0.84 on Thursday points to heavy action in generally bearish puts. While bullishness among newsletter editors is still quite high at 52.5% (down from 55.9% the prior week), this figure can remain high for months before the market truly shows signs of a budding correction.

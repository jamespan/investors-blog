Monday's stock market advance showed an increasingly bullish tenor, despite anticipation and anxiety developing over what the chairman of the Federal Reserve may or may not say at this week's annual confab of powerful bankers in the Rocky Mountains town of Jackson Hole, Wyo.




Since 1972, the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank has invited central bank chiefs from around the globe to Jackson Hole, home of the grand Teton peaks. There, these officials get together to share research and thoughts on what the right mix of monetary policy should be amid current economic conditions. Friday morning, slated for 10 a.m. ET that day, Fed chief Jerome Powell is slated to give a public statement. Expect it to be brief. Will Powell signal further clues that the bank will go ahead and begin reducing the cost of money?


Nobody knows. And that's why bullish gains by the [stock market on Monday](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) may have surprised some investors.


Meanwhile, crude oil futures sank sharply as the key near-expiration contract on light sweet crude fell 2.3% to $73.81 a barrel.


Investors bought long-dated Treasury bonds, sending the benchmark 10-year bond yield down two basis points to 3.86%. The yield began the year at the same level: 3.86%.


After solid gains last week, it came as no surprise for the major indexes to fall a bit after the open. But early-hour losses got quickly pushed aside, and the bulls stepped in for the rest of the session.

Stock Market Strengthens Quickly
--------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MP081924-232x300.jpg)After the Nasdaq edged 0.3% lower by around 10:20 a.m. ET, the composite index soon wiped out that drop and marched higher through the session's close. At 17,876, the Nasdaq led the stock market higher with a 1.4% gain. Since the start of the third quarter, the tech-bolstered index is now positive again, up 0.8% since July 1.


The Nasdaq composite also closed well above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), which is rising again.


The Nasdaq 100 tracker, Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), rose 1.3%. The two indexes' gains affirmed good breadth. Early data showed 3,047 stocks on the Nasdaq rose while 1,182 fell. That comes to roughly a winning margin of 3-to-1.


Small caps performed well. The Russell 2000 rose 1.2%, edging out an almost 1% lift by the S&P 500.


Sector indexes lagged. For instance, the Dow Jones Utility Average gained just 0.4%, trailing a nearly 0.9% move higher by the Dow Jones transportation average.


With no key economic news out on Monday and fewer corporations reporting earnings, volume in the stock market on Monday was understandably below average. Meanwhile, inside the IBD 50, [only 10 of the 50 companies](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) saw turnover go above their respective average over the past 50 sessions.


Beyond the stock market, bond traders did not show much difference in opinion on the extent the Fed could lower short-term interest rates.

Rate Cuts Remain On The Table
-----------------------------


At CME FedWatch, trading indicated a 77.5% probability that the U.S. central bank will lower the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 5%-5.25%. The chance of a half-point trim has edged lower in recent days to 22.5%. Go back to Aug. 12, and it was a 50-50 bet that the fed funds interest rate would fall to a target zone of 4.75%-5%.


Speculation over what the Fed will do remains fever-pitched.


In an [interview with the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-08-19-2024/card/fed-s-kashkari-weaker-job-market-should-open-the-door-to-a-september-cut-Hk1iDUIR0gmOdRVlZgHx?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1)Â Neel Kashkari, the head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, hinted that he might favor cutting rates at the upcoming Sept. 18 FOMC meeting. The reason? A sharply weakening labor market could have serious consequences for the U.S. economy.



"The balance of risks has shifted, so the debate about potentially cutting rates in September is an appropriate one to have," Kashkari was quoted as saying in an interview Friday. Back in June, Kashkari had apparently leaned toward no drop in short-term rates until the end of the year.



On the other hand, Ryan Grabinski, managing director and investment strategist at the Baird-owned research firm Strategas, said in a note delivered to clients and IBD that based on market data, the stock market is now forecasting roughly nine rate cuts, by a quarter point each time, by the end of 2025. "That feels aggressive," Grabinski noted.


**To Cut Big Or To Cut Little**
-------------------------------


"We expect that the Fed will cut rates next month and begin a gradual path in their cutting cycle. I think the more important thing to keep in mind is that when the Fed does begin cutting rates, we have to be thoughtful about what signal they're trying to send," Grabinski said. "If they are cutting because the economy is weak, that can be a bad sign." He points to the cuts in rates in both 2001 and 2007 as timely examples.


Either way, the decision will be historic. The last time the Federal Reserve cut interest rates? March 2020, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.


Breadth, meanwhile, was also favorable on the NYSE. There, advancers outdistanced decliners by a 3-1 ratio.


Looking at IBD's 197 industry groups, leadership on Monday was surely mixed. At the top, the very small dairy products group ran 7.4% higher. Another vastly shrunken group, media periodicals, strode 6.6% ahead.


But the true leadership came from industries such as biotech, gold and silver mining, oil and gas royalty trust, travel booking, movies, metal ores, homebuilding, ship transport, leisure services, generic drugs and security software. These groups and others gained 1.6% or more on the day. Virtually all of these industries hold at least a few companies with very good IBD ratings and excellent chart action.

The groups' action also highlights burgeoning power seen among new issues.


As noted in the Market Pulse above, **Bowhead Specialty** ([BOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOW)), part of the diversified insurance group, and software firm **Life360** ([LIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LIF)) stood out among companies rising in heavy trade.


Bowhead, a small cap with a $909 million market value, has not risen much since it cleared an IPO base with a 27.49 buy point.

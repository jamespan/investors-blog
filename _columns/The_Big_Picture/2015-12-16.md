=======================================================

The S&P 500 marked a follow-through day Wednesday after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point, the first increase since June 2006.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied 1.5%. The Dow rose 1.3% and the IBD 50 added 1.1%.


Market breadth was solid, with advancing stocks beating decliners by 9 to 2 on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, winners topped losers by nearly 3 to 1.


The S&P 500's bullish action confirmed a new market uptrend on the third day of its rally attempt. Volume on the NYSE rose from Tuesday's level. Nasdaq volume fell slightly. Volume was tracking well below Tuesday's levels ahead of the Fed's decision at 2 p.m. ET but picked up the pace later.


Market precedent shows it's best to look for a follow-through day on the fourth day or later of a rally attempt. Wednesday's follow-through was a rare one, occurring on the third straight bullish session in a row.

The market is back in a confirmed uptrend which gives investors the green light to start buying shares, at least moderately.


But base breakouts among institutional-quality stocks remain sparse.


**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) barely cleared a flat base with a 52.10 entry Wednesday in average volume. New issue **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) tried to clear an entry of 27.10 but ended below the buy point.


High-quality names getting support at their 10-week moving averages — where some opportunities exist — include **Equifax** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)) and **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)).


**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) continue to build bases.


The Fed's rate hike was widely expected. Now the question is how much and how fast the Fed will raise rates in 2016. According to data from the Fed, the central bank sees the federal funds rate at 1.4% at the end of 2016; 2.4% in 2017 and 3.3% in 2018.


The market's defensive side can be seen by looking at recent price action in the **SDPR Consumer Staples ETF** ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)). It closed just above a 51.23 buy point Wednesday and is up 3.6% in the past three sessions.


Top holdings of the XLP in the early stages of breaking out include **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)). Other holdings showing relative strength after recent breakouts include **Kimberly Clark** ([KMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMB)) and **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)).

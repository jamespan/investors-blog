The stock market ended Friday's session higher after a late bull charge helped indexes to solid monthly gains. A battery of jobs data is now set to come into focus for investors.




The Nasdaq composite got support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) as it ended the session essentially flat. While it suffered a weekly decline of 1.1%, it notched a strong gain of 6.9% for the month of May. It has climbed 11.5% thus far this year.


The S&P 500 ended the session up 0.8% and reclaimed its 21-day line even as it fell 0.5% for the week. The benchmark index turned in a monthly gain of 4.8% and is up just shy of 11% in 2024.


Advancers led decliners by nearly 4-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange and nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both exchanges.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best day of 2024 as it rallied 1.5%. Nevertheless, it remains stuck below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). A dead cat bounce saw **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) make the biggest daily gain on the Dow, while **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was the worst laggard. The blue-chip index ticked up 2.3% in May.


The Russell 2000 turned in a 0.7% gain on Friday and ended the month up 5%. It continues to find support at the 50-day line, a good sign. And while the Innovator IBD 50 exchange traded fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.2% for the session, it gained 7.4% in May.


PCE Rally Fades, Jobs Report Next
---------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MP053124.jpg)Friday's stock market got a boost after the Personal Consumption Expenditures reading for April came in mostly in line with expectations. Core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.8% year-over-year, while headline PCE rose 2.7% on an annualized basis. Investors seemed to take heart that consumer spending rose 0.2% on the month vs. expectations for a 0.4% lift.


A battery of economic data is due in the coming week. The S&P flash U.S. Purchasing Managers' Index reading for manufacturers — along with auto sales data, both for May — comes Monday while factory orders data drops Tuesday. Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management Services Index for May comes Wednesday.


But the main theme of the week is employment data. A job openings report for April comes Tuesday, with economists expecting a drop to 8.3 million positions available, while the latest ADP employment report comes Wednesday. But the key day is Friday, when the employment report for May is due. The U.S. economy is seen adding 195,000 jobs, according to Econoday. The unemployment rate is is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.


And while earnings season has thinned out, this week's reaction to **Salesforce**'s ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) results showed reports still have the potential to move markets. Cybersecurity leader **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Semtech** ([SMTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMTC)) and **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)) are among the noteworthy firms [reporting in the coming week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/crowdstrike-crwd-stock-samsara-semtech-earnings/).


These Stock Market Groups Flex Muscles

Drugstores, managed care stocks, water supply utility plays and wireless telecom services companies were among the best performers.


In contrast, medical software firms, database software plays, solar stocks and chip equipment firms all struggled.


The computer hardware industry group in particular had a tough time, [with a post-earnings dive](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/dell-stock-plummets-as-earnings-lag-ai-sales-growth/) by **Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) weighing on the stock market.

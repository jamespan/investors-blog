U.S. stock indexes rose Thursday, shrugging off the Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates the same.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.7%. The IBD 50 trailed with a 0.4% pop.


Volume edged down on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


The straight-up quality of the indexes' rebounds -- 10 up days in the past 12 sessions -- left them ripe for a pullback. So, the market's ability to handle the news from Britain was impressive.


Before U.S. markets opened Thursday, Britain's central bank announced it would keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, surprising most analysts who expected a rate cut. However, the Bank of England added that it would likely introduce new stimulus measures in August.


![MP071416_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MP071416_2-217x300.jpg)The news could've sparked a sell-off but didn't, neither in Europe nor in the states. London's FTSE 100 index lost 0.2% for the day.


After the strong 2 1/2-week advance on U.S. indexes, at least a pause is still reasonable to expect.


Meanwhile, Thursday's gains on Wall Street suggested that the U.S. stock market is developing a more confident temperament. News and data that could be interpreted as half empty are being seen as half full.


Blue chips appear to be among the beneficiaries of the half-full view.


In the past five sessions, strength in the market has had a goal-post quality. One upright is the dividend-rich Dow, which is up 3.4% over the past five sessions. The other upright is the risk-on small-cap Russell 2000, up 4.6% over the same time.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are just off the Dow's pace with gains of 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.


What accounts for this strange mix of leadership that is at once cautious and aggressive?


On the cautious side, the Dow's lineup of hefty dividend payers could be attracting buyers. Thirteen of the 30 stocks in the Dow offer 3% to 4% annualized yields, which stacks up well against Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury note offered a 1.47% yield going into Thursday's session.


On the growth side, the performance of top-rated stocks -- such as retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), financial analytics provider **Equifax** ([EFX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EFX)), electronic bond trading platform **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) and **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)) -- shows savvy stock pickers have made money under difficult conditions.


All six of the above stocks reached the 20% to 25% profit-taking level after breakouts earlier this year.


Banks received a lift Thursday, thanks to a strong quarterly report from **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). The stock popped 1.5% after topping the Street's earnings estimate.


**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) advanced 3% in apparent sympathy. **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) added 1%, and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) gained 2.5%.


Wells Fargo and Citigroup will report quarterly results before Friday's open. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has its second-biggest position in Wells Fargo.


Friday will be a busy day for economic news. Data placed on the table will include the consumer price index, retail sales, Empire State Manufacturing Survey, industrial production, business inventories and the University of Michigan's preliminary estimate on consumer sentiment.


Pay special attention to the Empire State manufacturing gauge. The consensus estimate is for 5.0, but that consensus isn't much of a consensus. The range of estimates is wild -- from 2.0 to 10.2. The survey results reflect positive scores minus negative scores. So a rating of zero is neutral.

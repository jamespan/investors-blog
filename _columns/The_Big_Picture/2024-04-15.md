  Stock Market Indexes Break Another Support Level As Bearish Signals Add Up

Early cheer faded in the stock market Monday, as indexes reversed lower and crashed through another guardrail. Rising Treasury yields and geopolitical risks vexed investors.




The Nasdaq composite slid 1.8% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%. Both benchmarks closed below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) for the first time since early November, back when the market confirmed a new uptrend.


With Monday's break of that support level, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended a 110-day streak of closes above their 50-day averages. That was the longest for the S&P since a 139-day run that ended March 9, 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq had equaled a 110-day run that ended Feb. 2, 2018.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was the first of the major indexes to break the 50-day line, dropped 0.6% Monday and nearly 1.7% from its session high. It was the Dow's 10th loss in 11 trading days — a bearish streak that hadn't happened since an identical slump in February 2020.


Small caps did poorly also. The Russell 2000 index slid 1.4% and undercut the 2,000 level. The IBD 50 index, which also has fallen below the 50-day average, lost 2%.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by 7-to-2 on the Nasdaq and by more than 5-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange. In another sign of weakening breadth, the number of [52-week highs has dimmed](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-apr-12-2024/) since April 5, while the number of Nasdaq new lows now surpasses new highs. That's a marked change from a trend in which new highs had dominated over new lows.


Stock Market Outlook Dims
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP041524_2.jpg)Volume edged lower on the NYSE and rose on the Nasdaq, which made the Nasdaq's loss a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). The March 8 distribution day on both indexes is off the count because 25 sessions have passed. That reduced the S&P's distribution count by one, though it's little comfort.


With the market weakening further, Investor's Business Daily on Monday reduced its recommended stock market exposure to 20%-40%. It had been cut to 40%-60% Friday after indexes undercut their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The stock market opened higher. Investors were in a good mood after Israel and allies largely swatted away Iran's missile and drone attack over the weekend.


The outcome lowered the chance of a larger conflict in the Middle East. But the crisis is not over; Israel still plans to respond to Iran's unprecedented attack. Late Monday afternoon, there was no sign of new military action, while the White House [pressed Israel to show restraint](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/biden-presses-for-diplomatic-response-to-irans-attack-on-israel-1c5452a1).


Some [defense stocks rose](https://www.investors.com/news/lockheed-martin-upgraded-defense-stocks-iran-israel/), but SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ([XAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XAR)) exchange traded fund fell 0.9%.


March retail sales also gave stock market sentiment a boost. Sales climbed 0.7%, above economists' expectations, and were revised higher for February. Still, the VanEck Retail ([RTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTH)) ETF reversed lower, closing with a 0.9% decline. The fund closed below the 50-day line for a second straight day.


Treasury Yields And The Stock Market
------------------------------------


One reason sellers are out in force is the continued rise of interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 12 basis points Monday to 4.627%, the highest since Nov. 13. Just this month, the yield has shot up nearly 44 basis points.


Certain classes of stocks are more sensitive to higher yields. For example, techs spend heavily in research and development. Companies that have no profits to invest must turn to debt markets for financing.


Treasury bonds act as a safe haven at times of crisis. But fading hopes for interest-rate cuts this summer — and possibly longer — are lifting yields.


Other crisis assets were mixed Monday.


Gold for April delivery rose $9.60, or 0.4%, to $2,365.80 per troy ounce, a record high. Nymex Crude for May delivery lost 25 cents per barrel, or 0.29% to $85.41. The U.S. dollar index is at the highest since early November.


Market Volatility Spikes
------------------------



Market volatility is rising as the stock market gets more nervous. The Cboe Market Volatility Index has awakened from a long slumber.


As it reached 19.23 Monday, the VIX made its highest close since Oct. 30. It snapped a streak of 112 trading days in which it had closed below 18, which is the longest such streak since the 117-day streak ending Oct. 9, 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


On Friday, the VIX jumped [more than 20% above its 10-day moving average](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility). Such spikes have marked stock market lows. This time, however, the major indexes are just starting to roll over. The spike in volatility, moreover, comes at a time when data shows investors are more nervous.


Mandy Xu, Cboe's VP Head of Derivatives Market Intelligence, says last week saw a significant surge in implied volatilities across various asset classes. VIX option volumes hit a six-year high, exceeding the highs in March 2023 during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis and March 2020 with the Covid panic.

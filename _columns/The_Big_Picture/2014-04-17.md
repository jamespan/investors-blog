Stocks tacked on modest gains Thursday, as the Nasdaq ended a three-week losing streak.

  

The Nasdaq added 0.2% Friday, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. The IBD 50 slipped 0.3%.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges. Thursday was an options expirations day, which often boosts volume.

  

From a technical angle, the week's action was positive.

  

The Nasdaq found support Tuesday at its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 regained its 50-day line Wednesday. And the indexes completed a week without showing distribution or stalling for the first time in 2014. (The four-day week might have helped on that score.)

  

Economic news Thursday was positive. First-time jobless claims came in below expectations. The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey trounced estimates.

  

Quarterly earnings reports continued to roll in with a mixed reception. The Street appeared to have difficulty deciding whether some results were positive or negative.

  

**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) missed the Street's estimate on earnings but topped the sales number. The stock jumped almost 7% and then reversed to close with a 6% loss. The turnabout appeared to coincide with news that Chipotle will raise prices.

  

A price hike can either boost revenue or drive away customers. The market's negative reaction might say more about the market than it says about Chipotle. The chain's appeal isn't built on cheapness.

  

Cyclical stocks appeared to react according to their earnings results.

  

Oil play **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), reporting before the open, beat on earnings and missed on revenue. The stock rose 1% at the open and then reversed to a 1% loss.

  

**Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) reported in-line EPS but topped the consensus estimate on revenue. The stock gapped up to a new high. Taiwan Semiconductor reset its base count in July. The stock is in a 5% buy zone from a breakout past 20.40.

  

Although stocks shouldn't be bought in a market correction, investors should be ready for a follow-through. Since March 2009, the time IBD's Market Pulse has stayed in correction varied from less than a week to six weeks. The average is 12 to 13 sessions. Thursday marked the 10th red day for the Market Pulse.

  

If the market shifts to uptrend, how should investors play it?

  

Strength is showing in cyclicals — the chip, auto and oil sectors. Cyclicals generally don't offer the same thrust as growth stocks.

  

If slower players lead, prudence would suggest lowering profit targets and loss-cutting levels — perhaps to 12% and minus 4%. This is especially true for investors who made little in the past uptrend.

  

When growth stocks are sizzling, setting targets at 20% to 25% and loss-cutting at minus 7% to 8% makes sense. But if growth doesn't lead the next uptrend, expectations must be lowered.

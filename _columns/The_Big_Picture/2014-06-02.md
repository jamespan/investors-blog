Stocks Fight Back, End Near Highs After Early Swoon
====================================================

Stocks turned in a respectable performance Monday — ending mixed and mostly unchanged but near session highs.


The session started off with some volatility. The Nasdaq fell 0.8% early but recovered for a loss of just 0.1%. The S&P 500 gained 0.1% and made a new record high. The Dow Jones industrial average marked an all-time closing high, rising 0.2%. NYSE volume dropped 21% from Friday's level. Nasdaq volume fell 10%.


Major indexes rallied off session lows after the Institute for Supply Management corrected a data error earlier in the day.


Initially, the ISM said its manufacturing index fell to 53.2 last month from 54.9 in April, well below expectations. The market didn't respond positively. However, stocks found their footing after the ISM corrected the error — twice — to settle on 55.4, mostly in-line with the consensus estimate.


Declining stocks had a small edge over advancers on the NYSE, while Nasdaq losers topped winners by an 8-to-5 margin. The IBD 50 rose fractionally, keeping pace with the broad market.


The Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend on May 27 with a 1.2% gain in higher volume. A new closing high for the S&P 500 last week provided additional confirmation. The good news is that distribution days for the major averages (higher-volume declines) have been nonexistent so far. Signs of institutional selling soon after a follow-through day sometimes indicate the new uptrend doesn't have legs.


Price and volume in leading growth stocks continue to look OK, but five-plus years into a bull market, there's no shortage of top-rated growth names that have made huge price gains.


Be wary of names like **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)), **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)), **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **Bitauto Holdings** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) and **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)). They're etching new bases but they're all late-stage.


Other leaders reset their base counts recently, effectively wiping the slate clean of persistent sellers. As a result, top-rated names such as **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Jones Lang LaSalle** ([JLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JLL)) are working on earlier-stage bases.


Leaders still near buy points after recent breakouts include **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) and **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)).


**GasLog Partners** ([GLOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOP)) surged out of a short IPO base in higher volume Monday, rising 5%. It closed less than 2% above a buy point of 27.54. The move was fueled by several positive analyst comments. The new issue is a spinoff of liquefied natural gas carrier **GasLog** ([GLOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLOG)), which owns 57% of GasLog Partners.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell for the second straight day, down 1% in heavy volume, after its Worldwide Developers Conference passed without much fanfare. (See story [here](http://news.investors.com/technology/060214-703097-apple-reveals-ios-8-mac-os-x-yosemite-at-wwdc.htm).) Apple is trying to make a case it's ready to become a market leader again despite a material slowdown in earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.

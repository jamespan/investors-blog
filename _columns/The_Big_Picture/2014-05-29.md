Stock Indexes Doing Fine Job Protecting New Uptrend
====================================================

Stocks traded in a tight range Thursday, once again protecting the new uptrend from trouble.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 tacked on 0.5% each. The IBD 50 advanced 0.6%.


Volume fell across the board.


The first few days of a confirmed uptrend carry certain risks. Uptrends that suffer a sell-off soon after a follow-through day are prone to fail.


So far, this uptrend has shown little hesitation since Tuesday's 1.2% pop in the Nasdaq, which confirmed the uptrend.


The refusal to give back much of the recent gains is a good sign. Also, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have had no problems staying above their 50-day moving averages.


However, the small-cap S&P 600 is struggling near its 50-day moving average. If the S&P 600 could retake its line, then bulls could take one more worry off the table. Small caps, which generally do best in an aggressively bullish market, have trailed the major indexes for much of this year.


Last year, the S&P 600 led with a 40% gain vs. 38% for the Nasdaq and 30% for the S&P 500.


While individual investors track the indexes to get a sense of the overall market's tone, breakouts are key to a new market uptrend.


On Thursday, **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) gapped up for a 5% gain in huge volume. The move was strong but could have been better. Palo was up 12% at the open. Still, the stock cleared a 72.60 buy point and gave investors a chance to buy.


A stock can be bought above the 5% buy zone when a gap-up provides the breakout.


**Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) also broke out. The retail stock popped 3.70 to 108.37, clearing a 107.84 buy point in heavy volume.


**Dow Chemical** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) parceled a breakout of sorts over three days as it cleared a 51.06 buy point. Volume was 23% above average Tuesday and Wednesday, and 19% faster Thursday.


While Dow isn't a stock with elite fundamentals, IBD identified it in The Income Investor on Feb. 3 as "a company with new elements." Dow is shedding weaker assets to become a higher-margin business. The stock is up 17% since early February and is in the 5% buy zone from its breakout this week.


The diverse strength from the above three stocks — a software-security firm, a retailer and a chemical, plastics and materials company — is good to see. The medical and energy sectors have dominated recently. Broader strength is welcome.


How should you play this young uptrend? One good way is to take an initial position in a stock clearing a buy point. Then treat it as a trial balloon. If the stock dives, you sell. If the stock moves sideways, you wait. If the stock starts working, you might buy a second or third stock.


The idea is to let the action move you to greater or lesser exposure.

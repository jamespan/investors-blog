The stock market ended mixed Tuesday after Monday's sharp drop. But losses were contained ahead of a busy week of potentially market-moving headlines.




Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. ET at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Last week, the minutes from the Nov. 1-2 Fed meeting showed that several Fed officials see smaller rate hikes coming "soon." After four straight 75-basis-point interest rate hikes, fed funds futures traders are leaning toward a 50-basis-point hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting.


The Fed will also be watching the Personal Income and Outlays report Thursday. Inside the report, the Fed will look for more signs of cooling inflation from the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Year over year, prices are expected to be up 6%, down slightly from September's reading of 6.2%. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy costs, are expected to be up 5%, also down slightly from 5.1% in December.


The November jobs report, also closely watched by the Fed, is due Friday. The Fed wants to see some softness in the labor market to help fight inflation. It hasn't been getting it yet.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After a sharp drop Monday to the 10-day moving average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed fractionally higher. IPhone production concerns in China weighed on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) again, which fell 2%. But weakness in Apple was offset by gains of at least 2% for **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **Dow** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)).


After slumping below its 10-day line Monday and the 4,000 level, the S&P 500 eased nearly 0.2%. Preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE.

Oil and gas stocks outperformed again, helping lift the Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) ETF to a gain of 1.5%. **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)), **APA** ([APA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APA)) and **EOG Resources** ([EOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EOG)) were among the best performers in the S&P 500, with gains of at least 3%.


**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) was another solid gainer in the S&P 500, up nearly 4%. After a nice rally off lows with some volume, it's been consolidating gains for several days and is just below a 39.36 buy point.


On the NYSE, advancing stocks had a slight edge over decliners.


The Nasdaq composite gave back 0.6% in higher volume, resulting in its second straight [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Despite the selling in the Nasdaq, winners were evenly matched with losers.


Small caps bucked the trend as the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) climbed 0.3%.


Current Strategy
----------------


Growth screens haven't been yielding much in recent weeks as value stocks, in general, continue to outperform growth stocks. While it's true that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are still in confirmed uptrends, the crop of actionable stocks has been disappointing. It hasn't been easy increasing exposure. After some moves Tuesday, [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) is only around 50% invested at this point.


If you're still holding on to some nice gainers, consider trimming positions or selling them outright. And when it comes to new buys, what kind of feedback are you getting? Are new buys making progress from buy points? In this case, it's OK to give them some room. But don't be afraid to take partial profits if a gain hits at least 10%. If new buys go the wrong way, cut losses at 3% to 4% instead of waiting for [the 7% rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) to trigger.

Light, flexible trading is the best course of action for now. If the uptrend starts to gain traction again, there will be plenty of opportunities to increase exposure. And don't be afraid to look for early entries, rather than waiting for a stock to hit a conventional buy point.


Breakouts over [trendlines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-draw-trend-lines-and-find-lower-buy-points-in-stock-charts/) are the best way to get an early entry into a stock. Oil refiner **H.F. Sinclair** ([DINO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DINO)) gave an early entry on Sept. 28 when it broke out over a trendline


Stock Market Movers
-------------------



Chinese stocks rallied sharply again on hopes that China will start to relax its zero-Covid policies after protests erupted in the country over the weekend.


But many Chinese stocks have [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/david-ryan-how-to-spot-and-understand-overhead-supply) issues, which could keep a lid on gains. **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) gapped above its 50-day line but closed off highs. BIDU stock is still more than 40% off its high and below its 40-week moving average. **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) vaulted 6.7%, but it's still below the 40-week line, where it found resistance earlier this month.


Two Chinese stocks that do not have much overhead supply are **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) and **Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)). PDD gapped out of a 12-week consolidation Monday and extended gains Tuesday. FUTU jumped to a 52-week high Tuesday.

Meanwhile, buying chart breakouts remains challenging, to say the least. Just look at **Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)), which broke out powerfully last week. It topped a 16.76 entry on Nov. 22, but sellers knocked the stock off highs the next day. It showed constructive price action during Friday's half session with a close near highs. But another breakout attempt Monday was met with selling, and CPRX stock extended losses Tuesday.


Breakouts were sparse Tuesday, but coal producer **Consol Energy** ([CEIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEIX)) fit the bill. The coal producer topped a 74.09 entry in strong volume. It finished in the 5% buy zone, but some would argue the stock is already extended after seven gains in eight sessions.

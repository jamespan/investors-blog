Stocks rode some bad news to a dazzling outcome Friday, as a weak GDP number convinced the Street that the Fed will go slow on rate hikes.


The Nasdaq swaggered 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 leapt 2.5%. The small-cap S&P 600 jumped 3.2%.


The IBD 50 popped 2.6%.


Volume rose across the board.


News played a key role in Friday's aggressive advance.


Fourth-quarter GDP came in at 0.7%, which fell shy of the consensus estimate for 0.9% growth.

Back in the day when quantitative easing was in play, the Street took bad economic news as a sign that quantitative easing would continue. And so the market would often rise on bad news.


QE is gone, but the logic has shifted to the conviction that bad news will force the Federal Reserve to think twice before raising interest rates. And so, the market rose Friday on the weak GDP number.


Overlooked in this mindset was a strong number in the Chicago Business Barometer for January. The Street expected 45.5. The barometer delivered a 55.6 reading, a stunning 12.7 points above December's 42.9 reading.


The gauge, which measures both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing activity, showed the highest growth pace in a year.


However, the inventories component fell to its lowest level since January 2015.


Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan lowered interest rates, leaving them at a negative level and adding to the easy-money tone.


The bullish move in U.S. stocks caused a change in IBD's market outlook from uptrend under pressure to confirmed uptrend. The Nasdaq delivered what would amount to a follow-through day, except it had made a mild follow-through Tuesday. The S&P 500 pegged a follow-through Tuesday with a 1.4% advance.


A distribution day Wednesday slapped pressure on the new uptrend, but the Nasdaq's action Friday erased most of the doubt.


A follow-through is never a guarantee of a bottom, but the situation looks more bullish than it did just a few days ago.


So far, recent breakouts or good follow-up action include **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Cray** ([CRAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRAY)), **Atmos Energy** ([ATO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATO)) and **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)).


Other stocks appear to be setting up for potential breakouts.


India-based bank **HDFC** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) is closing in on a 62.01 buy point in a double-bottom base. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) retook its 50-day line.


For the week, the IBD 50 added 2%; the S&P 500, 1.7%; and the Nasdaq, 0.5%. The small cap S&P 600 rose 2.4%.


Earnings reports continue in the coming week. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is due report Monday after the close.

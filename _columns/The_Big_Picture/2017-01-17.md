Stocks fell Tuesday when banks — the sector that has held its postelection gains best — showed the first signs of fraying.


The Nasdaq lost 0.6% as chip, pharmaceuticals, software and telecom stocks exhibited broad weakness. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3%. Volume rose, which if gave the indexes a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764). That's now six for the composite, an uncomfortable number.


Small caps continued to diverge from the rest of the major indexes. The Russell 2000 slid 1.4%. The Russell has been forming a series of lower highs and lower lows since peaking Dec. 9. That's how a downtrend is defined, although it's been a gently sloping decline.


![mp011717_65](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MP011717_65-194x300.png)Dow transports, off 1.1% Tuesday, are tracing a similar decline.


That's a contrast to the Nasdaq, which has been making higher highs and higher lows since November and stands as the leading broad index. The S&P 500 and Dow basically have gone nowhere for more than a month.


The composite is benefiting from relatively better performance from its largest components.


That's a trend apparent in the Nasdaq 100, which is also near record highs and showing little slack. **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) is a new high after a breakout and support at its 50-day moving average. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is fighting to save its breakout. Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is near a buy point, while **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) is shaping a handsome cup with handle.


But **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), another major Nasdaq component, dived 4% after news broke that it may face antitrust accusations. After the close, the FTC confirmed that it had sued Qualcomm over alleged anticompetitive practices.


Banking stocks were a gloomy sidebar of their own. Worries over proposed tax changes and a possible trade war overshadowed positive Q4 results from **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)).


Lower bond yields also weighed financials. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May indicated a hard Brexit, which added to uncertainty over London's future as a banking center.


SPDR S&P Bank ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) slid 3.4%, its largest drop since June 27, and is now testing the 10-week moving average.


The sudden weakness in banking stocks is significant because while other sectors had pared their postelection rallies, banks were holding up well.


Surges in pharmaceuticals, construction and steel had already faded and many of those stocks went into price consolidations or pullbacks. Banks, though, had been holding near highs, but that is now threatened.


What sectors are still holding up? Gold keeps bouncing back. Oil is flat. The IBD 50 also is basically flat, unable to move above the September and December highs. The index took hard hits Tuesday as its banking components suffered sizable losses. Eight of the 12 weakest IBD 50 stocks were banks, and those included declines of more than 3%. A few had big volume. The IBD 50 tumbled 2.3% Tuesday. **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) contributed greatly to the loss after plunging 12% in huge volume due to a setback in its legal battle with **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)).


While indexes of various stripes show an indecisive direction, there are signs that institutional investors are still buying stocks in large numbers.


The Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are good. More than 4,000 stocks in IBD's database have A or B Acc/Dist Ratings, and only about 1,000 have D or E ratings. In the neutral C rating, there are some 1,200 stocks.

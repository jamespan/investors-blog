Stock Market Soars On Election Results; FANG Stocks Amazon, Netflix Lead Nasdaq
================================================================================

The midterm election results and a 2.6% gain for the Nasdaq composite delivered a nice present for stock market bulls Wednesday. The Nasdaq 100 did even better, up 3.1%, helped by strong moves from [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), up nearly 7%, and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), up 5%.




The Nasdaq composite [followed through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on the seventh day of its rally attempt as several top-rated growth stocks made explosive moves in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) today. The S&P 500 also followed through with conviction, and the Dow Jones industrial average surged also, both with gains of 2.1%.


Nasdaq volume rose and preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in higher than Tuesday. Wednesday's follow-through rally confirmation means the general market is now in a confirmed uptrend.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MP110718-221x300.jpg)Breadth was solid, with advancers beating decliners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, gainers topped losers by more than 2-to-1.


Election Results
----------------


The midterm election results came in pretty much as expected as Democrats won control of the House of Representatives. Republicans maintained control of the Senate. [History shows](https://www.investors.com/news/split-congress-elections-stock-market/) that a split Congress is the best outcome for the stock market.


The Nasdaq closed just above its 200-day moving average Wednesday, but the index still has its 50-day moving average to conquer, currently around 7723. The S&P 500 is also below its 50-day line but regained the 200-day average. The Dow reclaimed its 50-day line Wednesday and is less than 3% from its high.


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was a top performer in the Dow, up 4%. Managed care firms were strong across the board after a few states voted to expand Medicaid coverage. A strong earnings report from **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) also helped. Humana is still in buy range after a breakout from a flat base with a 341.40 buy point.


Dow component **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 4%. **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) picked up 3% as it gets support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) for the first time since a breakout July 31.


What To Do Now?
---------------


With the stock market back in a confirmed uptrend, investors have the green light to start buying stocks. Wednesday's follow-through day was a sign of institutional buying, so it makes sense to swim with the market tide. When institutional investors are putting money to work, individual investor should be doing the same.


Keep in mind that while follow-through days have an excellent track record of flagging stock market bottoms, they don't always result in lengthy market uptrends. Still, Wednesday's bullish action raises the likelihood of a year-end rally.


Many growth investors have been raising cash amid pretty clear signs of institutional selling in the major stock indexes that started in early October. The goal now is to target actionable charts when they present themselves. Start with a small position and fill it out if it works. Do not move back into the market full-bore with the intent of being 100% invested as quickly as possible.


Stock Market Movers And Shakers
-------------------------------


In the early stages of a new stock market uptrend, buy candidates shouldn't be hard to find. There were plenty of them Wednesday.



In the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-data-dow-jones-sp-500-nasdaq-spdr-etfs/) today, two [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) staged bullish breakouts on earnings. Shares of [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) soared 35% to 96.19, good for a breakout over the 88.98 buy point. **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)), meanwhile, vaulted 15% to 121.16. It's still in buy range from the 118.18 entry.


Elsewhere, **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) gapped above its 50-day moving average, also on [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/etsy-stock-etsy-earnings/). Shares jumped 24% to 50.01, but Etsy is still working on the right side of a cup-shaped base with a buy point at 53.35.


Other big earnings winners included [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.marketsmith.com) names **Genomic Health** ([GHDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GHDX)) and **Evo Payments** ([EVOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVOP)) as well as [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) component **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)). Eighteen stocks in the IBD 50 rose 3% or more Wednesday, helping Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) to a gain of 3.1%.


Earnings winners in Wednesday's after-hours session included **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) and **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)).

The stock market ended a quiet session on a positive note Thursday as the major stock indexes closed near the day's highs.




Amid a healthy stock market uptrend, these four stock market leaders — [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and IBD SwingTrader stock **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) — are in or near buy zones.


In a healthy uptrend, expect leading companies to show bullish price-and-volume action — both as they develop new bases and when they [break out to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Stock Market Today
------------------


Ahead of Thursday's open, the Labor Department said first-time weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 250,000, lower than estimates that called for a rise to 265,000 vs. 262,000 in the previous week.

Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index rebounded to 6.2, sharply higher than estimates that expected a -5.0 reading. This index missed expectations in July at -12.3 for its second straight negative reading.


Finally, [existing-home sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/existing-home-sales-prices-housing-market-july-2022-11660774574) fell for a sixth straight month in July. Sales of previously owned homes declined 5.9% in July vs. the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.81 million, the weakest rate since November 2015, not including the pandemic-related drop in 2020, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.


Key earnings movers Thursday included **BJ's Wholesale** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)), **Canadian Solar** ([CSIQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSIQ)), Dow Jones stock **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Keysight** ([KEYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEYS)), **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)), **Sociedad Quimica y Minera** ([SQM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQM)) and **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)).


[BJ's Wholesale jumped 7.2%](https://www.investors.com/news/bjs-wholesale-tops-views-poised-for-breakout/), reclaiming a double bottom's 71.10 buy point. Canadian Solar surged more than 15%. [Cisco shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/csco-stock-cisco-stock-cisco-earnings-q22022/) rallied 5.8%. Keysight stock gained 6%. [Kohl's](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-analysts-see-trade-down-ahead-for-discounters/) tumbled 7.7%. [Synopsys beat estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/synopsys-quarterly-earnings-prewrite/) on the top and bottom lines, but shares still fell 2%. [SQM shares](https://www.investors.com/news/lithium-stocks-keep-running-with-sqm-earnings-on-deck/) tumbled 10%.

Market Trend
------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2% but remained below the 13,000 level and is still on pace to snap a four-week win streak. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 0.7%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and appeared to be squarely lower on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks outperformed Thursday, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied 1.4%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Onsemi** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) leapt 7.3%, retaking a 71.36 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [long consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


This week, the major stock indexes began to consolidate after a streak of big gains in recent weeks. The recent losses pale in comparison to the size of the stock market rebound since the June bottom, so the current pullback should be considered bullish action.


If the stock market is trading sideways, then most leading stocks will also be consolidating. These periods of rest can result in [handles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) on cup, saucer and double-bottom patterns, or even [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), which provide new buy points.

Four Stock Market Leaders To Watch
----------------------------------



Amid a still-healthy stock market rally, these four leaders are among the stocks in or near buy zones — [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Albemarle, Arista Networks, CF Industries and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Costco.


Albemarle remains in buy range following last week's breakout past a 273.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) in a [large cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/). The 5% buy zone goes up to 287.47. Shares are extended above a smaller cup with handle's 250.25 buy point. Bullishly, the stock's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hit a new high on the breakout day, confirming the lithium producer as a stock market leader.


Albemarle is a global miner and refiner of lithium, a critical component of batteries for electric vehicles and personal computers.

Networking Leader
-----------------



Arista Networks, [one of this week's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch picks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/networking-stock-arista-relentlessly-pursues-buy-point/), continues to plod up the right side of a double bottom that offers a 143.67 buy point. With the stock about 8% away from the current entry, look for a handle to offer a more risk-optimal buy point. Arista's RS line has been trending higher and is approaching a new high.


[ANET stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-arista-networks-inc-anet.aspx) boasts a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating, per the [IBD Stock Checkup.](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)


The maker of computer networking gear is benefiting from higher capital spending by Facebook-parent **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)). Meta has upped spending on cloud-computing infrastructure. Another big customer is **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).



CF Industries is building a cup base with a 113.59 buy point. The cup's depth of 30% from high to low falls within the desired range. The deeper the correction, the more effort a stock must make to rebound back to its highs. Keep an eye out for a potential handle to offer a lower entry.


CF Industries makes and distributes agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea and ammonium nitrate products.


[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Costco is in buy range past a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) and a 552.81 buy point following Tuesday's breakout move, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. The 5% buy area goes up to 580.45.

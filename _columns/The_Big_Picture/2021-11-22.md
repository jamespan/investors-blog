In a mixed session for the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), it certainly was a chastening Monday for the Nasdaq. The composite index got slapped off its perch, and some growth stocks got mauled by the bears.




Meanwhile, the announcement by President Joe Biden that he was retaining Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell instead of changing horses midstream saw value plays enjoy more success, at least for a day.


While Powell had been a favorite to retain the mantle, the bond market had not fully priced in his nomination. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note closed up more than nine basis points at 1.63%. It had sat at 1.58% just as his reappointment was confirmed. The yield on the two-year note closed the day up just over eight basis points at 0.59%. It had sat at 0.54% earlier in the morning.


This had a negative effect on the Nasdaq, which closed down 1.3%. With volume higher, this resulted in another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). It is now carrying two in total in recent weeks. The S&P 500 had a sour close, reversing from highs as it fell 0.3%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MP112221_2-249x300.jpg)NYSE volume also grew modestly vs. Friday. So, the S&P 500 also added a light day of pronounced institutional selling.


This distribution day follows a 0.5% decline in higher NYSE turnover on Oct. 27, plus a 0.8% fall on Nov. 10 and 0.3% dip on Nov. 17.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed well off highs, though it did manage to inch up barely. Strength in financials was underlined by the fact that insurance play **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) was the top performer on the index, with a gain just shy of 3%.


The S&P sectors finished mixed, with energy and financials faring best. Technology and communication services were the worst performers.


Growth plays in the stock market took a pounding, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) falling almost 5%. Strength among financials was not enough for small caps as a group, with the Russell 2000 falling out of positive territory late and giving up 0.5%.


Bank Stocks Rally
-----------------


Bank stocks of all stripes muscled higher amid rising yields. Both **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) were among the leading Dow Jones names after rising more than 2% each.



Others making solid gains included **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), which rose 3.1%; **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), which climbed 2%; and **US Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)), which popped up 2.4%. Among ETFs, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) and the leveraged Direxion Daily Regional Banks Bull 3X Shares ETF ([DPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPST)) each tacked on 3.6%.


However, Oanda senior analyst Edward Moya warned that bank stocks could come under renewed pressure soon based on Biden's pick for the vice chair for supervision, which is responsible for banking regulation.


"This does not signal the banks are in the clear as they could see an even tougher regulator announced shortly," he said in a research note. After passing on the opportunity to make Lael Brainard the new Fed chairman, there could be more danger ahead if Biden makes a pick to appease party progressives, Moya says.


These Industry Groups Do Best
-----------------------------


While bank stocks were in focus, [MarketSmith data shows](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=shop-redesign-2019) a number of less obvious industry groups fared best on the day.


The Retail-Consumer Electronics group — which includes names like meme stock **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), which popped more than 8% — was the top performer.


It led the day ahead of nearest challengers Media-Newspapers and Steel-Producers. [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) was raised from a quarter- to a half-size position after it moved above a [cup-with-handle entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) of 119.42. It closed the day above this [key buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).



These groups all rank outside the [top 50 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in terms of relative six-month price-weighted performance. Look to see if they can continue this momentum.


Worst Stock Market Performers Of The Day
----------------------------------------


In contrast, it was a brutal day for software stocks. Eight out of the bottom 10 industry group performers were in software, with Computer Software-Enterprise faring the worst.


Headed into Monday's session, Software actually ranked outside the top 10 among 33 sectors making up [IBD's stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-nov-19-2021/).


Outside of software, the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor and Retail-Internet groups fared terribly for the day. The former group includes the likes of **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), while the latter includes **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Chinese giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)). Mastercard was the worst performer out of these names, falling more than 5%. The other three closed down nearly 3%.

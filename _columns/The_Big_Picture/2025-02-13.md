The stock market closed sharply higher Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite leading the way as Wall Street pushed the major stock indexes higher despite that President Donald Trump ordered a plan for "reciprocal" tariffs.


The Dow Jones index advanced 0.8%, while the S&P 500 moved up 1% and the Nasdaq rallied 1.5%. All three are just shy of new highs. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 index rose 1.2%, still below a downtrending 50-day moving average.




All of the 11 S&P 500 sectors climbed, with materials, consumer discretionary and technology pacing the gainers. The utility and industrial sectors were the day's laggards.


Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. Amid the session's positive action, advancers outnumbered decliners in a 3.6-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 2.7-to-1 on the Nasdaq, [according to MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/market-data/us). The broad advance helped improve the stock market's outlook.


In the [latest expansion of tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-import-tax-executive-order/), Trump signed an executive order Thursday designed to level the playing field with trade partners via what he terms "reciprocal" tariffs. In theory, the approach could offer other countries a way of avoiding the tariffs by simply bringing down their own trade barriers to U.S. products.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) were among the top performers Thursday, with gains of 3.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Nvidia is attempting to surpass resistance at the 50-day line, while Cisco is at record highs after it reported earnings late Wednesday.


On the Dow's downside, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) declined 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively. But those two stocks deducted only about 12 points off the Dow, which added 342 points Thursday.


In the Nasdaq 100, **Grail** ([GRAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRAL)), up nearly 34%, and **AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)), up 24%, were the best stocks of the day. Meanwhile, **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) tumbled 33% and 8.2%, respectively. Both reported earnings ahead of Thursday's open.


All of the [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended higher, as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) climbed 1.8%. Notably, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) raced 5.8% higher, but remains below the 50-day line.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund jumped 5%, breaking out to new highs and past a 32.24 buy point. Investor's Business Daily's [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) had a number of solid winners on the session, including **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)), which soared 29% on earnings.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP021325-228x300.jpg)


The combination of bullish signals — the S&P and Nasdaq adding space above their 50-day lines, bullish breadth, the IBD 50's breakout — calls for more-aggressive investing. Thus, IBD raised its recommended exposure level to 80%-to-100% from 60%-to-80%.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are poised for more gains, closing at the top of a narrow consolidation that goes back to late January. In addition, the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) hit a new high Thursday.


Although investors should be buying more stocks or adding to positions, they should continue to utilize diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/). Although many breakouts in the past few weeks have given growth investors good opportunities, it's important to monitor positions that may act out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules, like a sharp break of the 10-week moving average.


If the market is able to extend its rebound, be on the lookout for more stocks breaking out past correct buy points.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured another six new stocks, notably **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)), which topped a 112.90 flat-base buy point. But the Near Pivot list has dwindled to just seven ideas, a sign that many top stocks have already broken out or become extended.

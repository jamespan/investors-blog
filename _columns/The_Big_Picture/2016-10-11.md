If your portfolio was flush with dairy and meat-product stocks, then Tuesday's action was likely mouthwatering.


While shares in those two defensive industry groups rose, stocks in virtually the rest of IBD's 197 industry groups dropped fast, as the stock market encountered its roughest session of selling in more than a month.


A late-afternoon rebound managed only to shave a sliver off the day's big losses. The Nasdaq composite led the way, down 1.5% by session's end after falling as much as 1.9%.


Volume jumped sharply on both major exchanges. Combined with the big index declines, the price-volume action is perhaps the clearest signal that an investor can get that the big boys and girls of the market — namely mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, endowments and banks — decided to take profits off the table and raise cash en masse.


![mp101116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MP101116-178x300.png)At IBD, there's a name for such days in which the market falls in higher volume — distribution. And as seen in the accompanying Market Pulse table, Tuesday's action marked a fifth such day of spirited institutional selling on the Nasdaq and the eighth on the S&P 500. A heavy load of such distribution days over a relatively short period of time can mark an inflection point in the market.


In the past, the major indexes have been able to shoulder a large number of distribution days because the declines themselves were mild in manner. That's not the case today.


Among the five distribution days on the Nasdaq, three saw declines of 1% or more (including Sept. 9, Sept. 13 and Tuesday). The Sept. 29 drop was 0.9%. In other words, the selling has shown more teeth.


IBD's current outlook now downshifts into "uptrend under pressure" from a confirmed uptrend.


While that's a solid gain over the past three months (from the June 30 follow-through), Tuesday's pullback signaled alert investors to be cautious. This means selling stocks to prevent any from losing gains from recent breakouts; raising some cash in the portfolio; keeping losses small in other names; and avoiding those stocks that are trying to break out of flawed bases or moving higher in limp volume.


The Nasdaq 100 also fell 1.5% on Tuesday, confirming the heavy selling in many tech stocks after genetic-analysis firm and former big market winner **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) issued a Q3 sales miss ahead of its formal results. While a few big-cap techs do trade primarily on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq remains the bastion of chip, software, internet and biotech heavyweights in terms of both revenue, earnings and market capitalization.


The S&P 500 fell 1.2%. Small caps got hurt more, with the S&P SmallCap 600 down 1.6% and the Russell 2000 off nearly 1.9%. Losers trounced winners on the NYSE by a 7-to-1 ratio.


Construction-related names, from young small-cap leader **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) to megacap home-improvement chain **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), fell sharply as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hit as high as 1.78%. That was the highest rate since June 3, according to Tradeweb.


Higher interest rates could provide a stiffer headwind for certain industries, including homebuilding and large-scale infrastructure projects that require large amounts of debt financing. According to the CME Group's Fed Watch website, market participants are now seeing a 67% chance of the Federal Reserve raising short-term rates by 25 basis points at the Dec. 13-14 meeting.


That said, it's remarkable to see that the Nasdaq finished the day just 1.8% off its all-time peak of 5342. Plus, for now, the composite index showed stickiness near its rising 50-day moving average. In healthy uptrends, the major indexes tend to trade on the north side of this chart line, not on the south side.


The General Market Indicators page (see the link at the bottom of this article) also showed positive Accumulation/Distribution ratings for the Nasdaq (B-) and S&P 500 (C+) as of Monday. As you can see on the large daily charts of these two indexes, since early September both have posted more than handful of up days in above-average volume. A grade of C+ or higher is favorable.


Amid the broad drop in high-growth stocks, it may seem tempting to hunt for bargains in dividend payers. Yet this territory of the market also succumbed to broad selling.


The Dow Utility average dropped 1.1%. Telecom play **Verizon Wireless** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), which boasts a stout annualized dividend yield of 4.6%, has fallen more than 12% since hitting a multiyear peak of 56.95 on July 5. Leading real estate investment trust **National Retail Properties** ([NNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NNN)) (3.9% yield) is trading below its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since December.

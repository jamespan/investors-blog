Stocks Surge Early But Give Back Two-Thirds Of Gain
====================================================

Stocks spurted ahead early Thursday but gave back about two-thirds of the morning's gains.

  

The Nasdaq closed with a 0.5% gain after being up 1.6%. The S&P 500 and IBD 50 also added 0.5%.

  

Volume slipped on the NYSE but edged up on the Nasdaq. Turnover was fast during the morning ascent and then dropped off during the afternoon retreat.

  

So the volume action remained bullish, although the uptrend remains under pressure. The indexes' close in the lower part of the day's price ranges was disappointing, though.

  

Coming after Wednesday's big losses, any kind of a gain was a relief to the bulls. Meanwhile, the bears had to be disappointed after getting their darkest hopes up Wednesday. During this uptrend, the Nasdaq has suffered back-to-back down days only once â€” Nov. 4-5.

  

Bears once again had to find their consolation in the abundance of new lows. The new-lows tally kept to triple digits, although about one of every four new lows was an oil stock.

  

A reduction in oil prices traditionally is regarded as bullish for many sectors, including retail, airlines, plastics and to some extent autos. (Low gasoline prices can shift vehicle sales to higher-priced and higher-margin SUVs and trucks.)

  

If so, why are these sectors starting to stutter?

  

Some analysts see a downside to low oil prices, thanks to the Federal Reserve's policies. A Bloomberg News article reported that some market watchers contend the Fed's near-zero interest rates policy has created a bubble in energy-company debt. The default rate on energy-related junk bonds will leap, according to this scenario.

  

Bulls can only hope that defaults don't become a bigger story than low oil prices.

  

The market appears to be uncertain. Until West Texas intermediate crude oil finds a floor, it's hard for the stock market to price in the presumed consequences. Oil fell 2% Thursday, sliding under the $60 level for the first time since July 2009.

  

Two quality stocks broke out Thursday.

  

**Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) zoomed 9% in huge volume on strong quarterly results. The stock is 5% past an 89.17 entry.

  

New issue **Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) cleared a 40.35 buy point in an IPO base. The stock is 2% above the entry. Volume is hard to judge because of Habit's brief trading history.

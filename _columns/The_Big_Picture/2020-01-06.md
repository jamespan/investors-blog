If the U.S. and Iran are headed to war, the stock market did not believe it Monday.




While war drums beat in the Middle East, there was a sense of calm on Wall Street. The stock market opened lower after a weekend of threats and counterthreats following the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general. But U.S. indexes bounced back and climbed into the close.


The Nasdaq composite, which was off as much as 0.8% at the open, closed 0.6% higher. The S&P 500 also reversed higher and added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%.


Defense stocks were mixed and largely unmoved. That can be taken as a sign that institutional investors don't expect military conflict between the U.S. and Iran. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ([ITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITA)) edged up 0.1%. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman gave back most of their morning gains.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP010620-236x300.jpg)Oil prices, sometimes a barometer of Middle East tensions, came off early highs and closed lower. Late Monday, U.S. crude futures were down 0.4% to $62.78 a barrel. Options investors are not showing much fear at all. The put-call volume ratio Monday was 0.75, well below panic levels.


But in other ways, investors were repositioning themselves for a widening conflict.


Cybersecurity stocks rose on worries that an Iranian retaliation may come as a cyberattack. Already, the website of the little-known Federal Depository Library Program was attacked by [hackers who posted pro-Iran and anti-Trump messages](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/05/iran-hack-homeland-security-website-hacked-image-bloody-trump/2818308001/). The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF ([HACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HACK)) rose more than 1% and is at a new high.


Gold prices, a hedge at times of crisis, extended their advance. SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), an ETF that tracks the price of bullion, broke out above the 146.92 buy point of a base. It is trading at the highest level since April 2013.


Stock Market Due For Pullback?
------------------------------


The stock market finished 2019 showing little signs of a top. After such a strong fourth quarter (the Nasdaq rose more than 3.5% for three straight months), some consolidation would not be a surprise. But if anything is surprising so far it's that the major indexes have been so resilient despite geopolitical tensions.


Positive price reversals Monday and moderate losses Friday after the Iran crisis broke out suggest the stock market is trying to extend the fourth quarter's solid performance. Lacking any contrary signs, investors can put aside war fears and remain invested in stocks.



The IBD 50 climbed 0.4%, with a boost from software and consumer stocks.


**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) led the IBD 50 with an increase of more than 4%. The stock broke out, clearing the 166.44 buy point of a handle in a choppy pattern. Volume was heavy. RBC Capital raised the cloud software leader from outperform to a Top Pick and raised the price target to 215 from 200.


Outside the IBD 50, new issue **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Shares are in buy range from the 27.29 buy point. Volume surged. Dynatrace was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


The Dow transportation average fell 0.5%, making it one of the weakest sectors of the day. Higher fuel price are pressuring transports. Also, Bernstein downgraded trucker **J.B. Hunt** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) to market perform from outperform, reports said. J.B. Hunt shares fell 1.7%.

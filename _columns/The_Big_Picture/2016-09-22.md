Big-Cap Techs Hold Post-Fed 'No Hike' Party; Small Caps Win Big

Did the continuation of late Wednesday afternoon's relief rally feel pretty good?


If you're a pessimistic short seller, well, probably no. But if you've been buying some of the best growth companies on the Street over the past few months, and you're a polite person, then you may be quietly showing a toothy smile.


Amid all of the angst over the "bubble" in the U.S. Treasury markets, dull GDP growth around most parts of the world, and the continued threats of attacks — both violent ones in big U.S. cities and cyber-type ones — the market acted on Thursday the way it should the day after resuming a general uptrend.


The Nasdaq composite, buoyed by gains in large-cap techs, gained 0.8% on top of Wednesday's solid 1% advance. The S&P 500 nearly matched that gain, up 0.6%. Volume ran higher most of the day but wound up lower. Wednesday's turnover had accelerated in the last two hours of the session, making for a tough comparison.

The market decided to applaud another sharp drop in weekly jobless claims over an unexpected drop in the U.S. Leading Economic Indicators index (-0.2% vs. Econoday's consensus estimate of a 0.1% rise) in August.


Small caps affirmed the strong action among leading stocks; the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both rallied 1.5%. The S&P 600 is up 13.8% this year, scorching the S&P 500's 6.5% year-to-date return.


In a healthy uptrend, many of the market's winners tend to range between $1 billion and $15 billion in market cap. In other words, top CAN SLIM-quality names often start out as small-caps or midcaps at the start of their giant runs.


Another bright spot in Thursday's action? The S&P 500 muscled sharply back above its 50-day moving average, which itself is still rising. So while the action in 2016 has no doubt been choppy at times, a rising 50-day line indicates that the overall price trend is still up.


(You can track the path of the 50-day moving average of the S&P 500 by clicking on the link at the bottom of this article. The line is dotted on the big daily charts. On the charts at Investors.com, the 50-day line is painted in red.)


With the prospect of interest rates remaining near zero at least through the beginning of December, it was more than clear that the big money continued flowing back into equities.


The Federal Reserve's decision not to raise the cost of overnight loans between big banks depressed the U.S. dollar, which in turn sparked some buying in the commodity sector. However, while oil and steel stocks certainly rallied, they didn't post the biggest gains. Numerous interest rate-sensitive issues flourished even more for the day, including wireless telecom service, telecom infrastructure, water supply and RV maker stocks.


A fast rise in interest rates would increase costs for companies that rely on big loans to keep growing.


What if the Fed instead had decided to hike the fed funds rate Wednesday? Would it cause a big dent in the earnings and sales of the market's most dynamic companies?


Likely not. Consider the current **[IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)**, a good barometer of fast-growing entrepreneurial firms. Twenty-one of the 50 have no long-term debt. It's common for high-growth firms to invest for the future using their outstanding operating cash-flows.


Among 27 other companies, the average long-term debt-to-equity ratio through the end of 2015 stands at 87%. That's not excessive. The median ratio came in between 5% and 16%.


Among the IBD 50, just one company (**Jack In The Box** ([JACK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JACK))) has a debt-to-equity ratio exceeding 1,000%. You cannot calculate such a ratio for gym operator **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) because it has an overall shareholders deficit of just $1 million as of Dec. 31 last year.

**IBD'S TAKE**: **A*libaba*** *and other fast-growing large-cap e-commerce plays may be already extended from a proper buy point, but other **[highly rated growth stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx)** are near their buy zones. To find such names, go through the annotated charts of IBD Leaderboard.*

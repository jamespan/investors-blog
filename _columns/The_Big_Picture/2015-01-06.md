The stock market sustained more losses Tuesday, made all the more disheartening by a sell-off in the closing minutes.


The Nasdaq tumbled 1.3% and the S&P 500 0.9%.


Both started bouncing back in the afternoon, in what was shaping up as a bullish reversal. But selling washed over the exchanges in the final 20 minutes of trading. Thus, the best attempt so far to stop the market slide collapsed in a flash of selling.


Volume rose, confirming that institutional investors cut back some more on their holdings.


Tuesday made it five declines in a row for Wall Street, almost all of them marked by bearish closes near the session lows.


Small caps fared poorly, with the Russell 2000 skidding more than 3%. Utilities, tobacco, beverages and real estate investment trusts — defensive sections of the market — were some areas that came out relatively better. The Dow utilities average rose 0.2%.


The market is still making higher highs and higher lows. But new lows are within easy reach, and a raft of distribution days has left little doubt that sellers have taken the commanding heights of the market.


Perhaps more than any other reason, the dearth of leading stocks with gainful breakouts is the reason to favor cash at the moment.


Institutions clearly show less appetite for stocks, especially the growth kind.


The IBD 50, a representation of the growth arena, skidded 2.3%.


Small investors need to follow the lead of the institutions and reduce exposure to the market as quickly as possible. Cutting losses short is paramount. Selling with a 4% or 5% loss can be advantageous in today's market. Taking profits is another way to raise cash.


It's best to avoid buying stocks, Instead, spend time studying high-rated stocks forming bases. There are several fine examples in the IBD 50 (today starting on Page B2).


The rout in oil prices is putting more money into Americans' wallets. But it is also hurting energy companies, and the effects are spilling over to other sectors. **U.S. Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) said it will lay off more than 750 workers and halt operations at two plants at its steel-tubing business because orders from oil and gas companies have shrunk.


Crude closed below $48 a barrel Tuesday, and the energy sector took another beating.


The 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% to its lowest since May 2013, according to Tradeweb, as investors sought the safety of U.S. debt. Even at paltry yields, Treasuries are comparatively more attractive than the debt of other major economies.


The put-call volume ratio closed above 1.0 for the second day in a row. Those are elevated readings of market fear, and ultimately it can be good for stocks.


For more than a year, indexes have bottomed when the ratio got too high. While that's a gauge to watch, it is no substitute for the behavior of the major indexes. Those remain in a slog of distribution.


The VIX, another measure of market anxiety, is rising toward the peak that marked the December market low. But the VIX remains farther off the peak that coincided with the October lows.

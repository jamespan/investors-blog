Blue Chips, Small Caps Lead Stock Market, As Earnings Reports Loom
===================================================================

Stock indexes posted solid gains and all-time highs Friday, as the stock market prepared for a bolder move into the earnings season.




[Blue chips](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9% Friday, while the Nasdaq and the [large-cap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/big-cap-stocks-can-be-winners/) S&P 500 advanced 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The Russell 2000 gained 0.8%, an unusual day of outperformance for small caps lately.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was indicated nearly flat on the NYSE.


In the coming week, [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/earnings-season-underway-consider-this-options-strategy/) will likely make its mark on the stock market. While companies with a fiscal year ended in May have already reported in some cases, many big players in the stock market are just getting ready to report.


Can Banks Set A Bullish Tone In The Stock Market?
-------------------------------------------------


**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) will report Monday. Rivals **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) report Tuesday. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) report Wednesday. **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) reports Thursday.

Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at the end of July. Lower interest rates can hurt bank's net interest margins, especially large institutions. Yet, lower expectations for banks could set up some estimate-beating results.


Growth Stocks And Cyclicals
---------------------------


Other stocks with a more growth-oriented stance will report during the week. They include **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


In the cyclical camp, three railroads will report: **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)), **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) and **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)).


CSX and Kansas City Southern are trading close to [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Cyclical stocks can be challenging. "Rallies in cyclical stocks may tend to be more short-lived and prone to falter at the first hint of a recession or an earnings slowdown," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


At this juncture, the Street isn't expecting a recession any time soon.


Stay Ready
----------


Last week The Big Picture advised investors "to get ready for possible breakouts." Stocks breaking out during the week included **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Centrais Eletricas** ([EBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBR)), **Enterprise Products** ([EPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPD)), **Pegasystems** ([PEGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEGA)) and Goldman Sachs.


These moves give growth investors more opportunities and are a positive sign for the general market.


The Coming Week
---------------


What about the coming week?


Stocks that could be ready to make a run at crossing a buy point include **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)).

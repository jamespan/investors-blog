The stock market ended narrowly mixed Thursday, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reversed slightly lower after hitting new highs. Up next, Wall Street braces for Friday's employment report for May.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, extending a win streak to three sessions. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended barely lower after hitting more record highs earlier in the day. But the small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%. It closed just above the 50-day moving average, where the index has been finding support.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


The Labor Department's employment report will be announced before the stock market opens Friday. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to rise by 188,000 in May, up from April's 175,000 increase, per Econoday estimates. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.

Dow Jones Movers: Salesforce And Amazon Rally
---------------------------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) were the biggest gainers, with advances of 2.6% and 2%, respectively. Salesforce alone added nearly 41 points to the Dow's 78-point gain. Amazon shares regained their 50-day line.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) reversed 1.1% lower after briefly hitting more record highs. Shares are more than 20% above a 974 alternate buy point following the May 23 breakaway gap. CEO Jensen Huang [disclosed plans to sell some of his stock](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy/), part of a plan previously announced.


After Thursday's reversal, investors who bought at that entry or the 922.20 handle buy point may consider taking profits in the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.3% to give back a part of Wednesday's 3.6% gain. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Dutch Bros** ([BROS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BROS)) climbed 0.6% to move further out of buy range beyond a 36.17 cup-base entry.

Stock Market Today: What To Do Now
----------------------------------


Following Wednesday's advance to record highs, IBD boosted its recommended market exposure range to 80%-100%. That means investors should be buying new breakouts or using follow-on buy areas to raised exposure to market leaders.


But don't get complacent. Keep an eye out for sell signals on individual stocks, like round trips back to buy points or sharp breaks of the 50-day line.


Just as we gradually increase exposure as the market recovers from a downtrend, we also incrementally reduce exposure as the market becomes overheated. Signs calling for risk reduction can include factors like stocks and indexes getting too far above a moving average.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have four distribution days over the past five weeks, although the earliest (a May 7 stalling day) is due to expire next week. (Wednesday's Market Pulse incorrectly stated the S&P 500 had five distribution days. Just like the Nasdaq, it has four days of institutional selling.)

S&P 500 Member Booking Eyes Buy Point
-------------------------------------


**ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), **Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)) and **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) are stocks to watch as they trade near buy points.


[ASML stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/asml-stock-tsmc-buys-high-na-euv-chip-gear/) hit an early-entry [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 992.88 from a handle Wednesday. The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) extends to 1,042.52. Now, shares are rapidly nearing another buy point at 1,056.34.


S&P 500 component Booking lost nearly 0.6% Thursday, trading just shy of a 3,853 buy point in a cup with handle.


Novo Nordisk rose 1%, extending a win streak to six sessions. Shares are squarely in buy range past a 137.22 cup-with-handle buy trigger that runs up to 144.08. The most recent formation is a late-stage base, which carries more risk and less upside than earlier-stage formations.


Spotify shares closed just above the 319.30 buy point of a flat base, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) pattern recognition.

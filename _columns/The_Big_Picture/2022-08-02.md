The stock market wavered on Tuesday as the post-Fed rally ran out of steam, although small caps and leading stocks fared better than most major averages.




Indexes fluctuated through much of Tuesday's session and then faded into the closing bell. Performance varied widely among the different gauges.


The day belonged to leading growth stocks, namely the IBD 50. A mix of consumer, energy and health care leaders helped the index rise more than 1%, driven by a handful of outsize gains.


**Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) led the IBD 50 with a 9.4% rally on strong earnings.


**Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)), another earnings winner, jumped more than 12%. **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) added 4% and is now forming the right side of a base as fertilizer stocks try to rebound.


The Russell 2000 lost less than 0.1% while international blue chips struggled. Small caps appeared to benefit from larger domestic exposure. The [Vanguard Total International Stock ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) ([VXUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VXUS)), which excludes U.S. companies, fell 1.2%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MP_1x_080222-198x300.jpg)Pockets of strength in software, chip, biotech, solar and internet stocks helped the Nasdaq limit its loss to 0.2%. The S&P technology sector was down 0.7% overall.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 1.2% drop.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) generated much of the Dow's damage, sliding nearly 6%. It sold off even though [the heavy machinery maker beat Q2 views](https://www.wsj.com/articles/caterpillar-second-quarter-sales-up-11-11659439415) and gave a positive outlook. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) fell 3.4%.


Volume rose briskly above Monday's levels on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. That gave a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500. Still, the amount of distribution is minimal. The July 22 distribution day on the Nasdaq got wiped out due to a 5% climb from that day.


Earnings, Fed Talk Influence Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


Tuesday's stock market wrestled with earnings reports, economic data, remarks from Fed officials and political strife.


Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said he hopes the Fed will be able to slow its [pace of rate increases](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-official-says-economy-needs-rate-setting-that-slows-economic-growth-11659456091) over the remainder of the year. But he wouldn't rule out another 75-basis-point hike at the Fed's next meeting in September.


"I think that there's enough time to play out that 50 (basis points) is a reasonable assessment, but 75 could also be OK," Evans said.


The stock market also dealt with geopolitical risk, this time in the Far East. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's diplomatic [visit to Taiwan angered Chinese leaders](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-china-us-tensions?mod=hp_lead_pos1). Beijing, which had warned of consequences if Pelosi went ahead with her trip, [sent warplanes over the Taiwan Strait](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nancy-pelosi-heads-to-taipei-as-china-warns-of-disastrous-consequences-11659442605) and launched live-fire naval exercises.


The reaction in Asian stock markets was just as swift. The Shanghai Composite slid 2.3%, the largest one-day drop since May 24. The Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 2.4%. The Tokyo Nikkei 225 Index lost 1.42%.


But in the U.S. stock market, Chinese shares bounced off early lows. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) pared a 2.3% loss to 0.7% at the closing bell. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF ([KWEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KWEB)) climbed 1.7%.


On the flip side, iShares MSCI Hong Kong ([EWH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWH)) fell 1.5%.

Market Pauses After Big July
----------------------------


After a July rally that lifted the S&P 500 and Dow to their best monthly performance since November 2020, the stock market seems due for a rest. That scenario is playing out so far this week, with minor damage as we head to midweek.



More breakouts are providing opportunities for bulls. **Aris Water Solutions** ([ARIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARIS)) broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 22.10 buy point. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) made new highs too.


[MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith)'s list of recent breakouts has swelled to more than 40 stocks, but just three have climbed more than 10% above their buy points.


Stock market conditions have improved enough for IBD to put its market outlook at "confirmed uptrend." But remember that the market is climbing out of a deep hole, and risks are significant. Many economists fear a recession and some believe the economy has already entered one.


In short, investors should be increasing exposure gradually. If initial trades work out, that should instill the confidence needed to make further buys.

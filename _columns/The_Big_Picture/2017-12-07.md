  Nasdaq, Small Caps Rise; Market Wants Clarity On These 5 Issues

Stock market leadership shifted back to the tech and small-cap indexes Thursday, but the moves weren't especially convincing.


The Nasdaq settled for a 0.5% gain after being up 0.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 popped 0.8%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average pegged gains of 0.3% each.




 Volume in the stock market Thursday was higher on both the Nasdaq and NYSE. Wednesday's Nasdaq volume was below average, so the narrow beat on the Nasdaq didn't mean much.


Unmistakably strong volume would have provided a bullish accompaniment to the Nasdaq's solid price gain.


Instead, trade had a place-holding quality.


This isn't too surprising when an investor considers the factors that the market must now consider. There are at least five items.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP120717-199x300.png)No. 1, the tax-cut bill:** If the House and Senate reconcile their differences, the legislation will land on President Trump's desk. But there is still a small element of doubt. This Republican Congress has struggled with unity. If something were to derail the tax cut bill, look for a nasty reaction on Wall Street.


**No. 2, the partial repeal of Dodd-Frank:** At one time, Republicans talked of a clean, outright repeal. But the current bill, which cleared the Senate Banking Committee with support of some Democrats on Tuesday, is a compromise.


Still, any lessening of Dodd-Frank's regulatory burden could boost bank profits, especially those of small- or medium-sized banks.


**No. 3, infrastructure:** This one has almost been forgotten after numerous delays and failures (so far). Infrastructure was a first-100-days item for the Trump administration but it fizzled. President Trump's next big priority is reportedly infrastructure.


A look at the stock charts of the cement stocks suggests that the infrastructure angle is not yet priced into the stock market. The relative strength line of the cement group has been sagging since late January.


The relative strength line measures performance vs. the S&P 500.


A few concrete stocks are stirring. **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) is in its 5% buy zone after a breakout; ditto **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)). **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)) is in a base-on-base pattern and near a 31.89 buy point.


**No. 4, jobs:** The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release payroll data for November before the market's open Friday. The consensus calls for 190,000 nonfarm jobs added. The range of estimates is wide – from 153,000 to 250,000.


With estimates so far apart, a surprise is possible.


**No. 5, the Federal Reserve:** A two-day meeting next week is considered unlikely to bring any shocks. The Street expects the Fed to announce a quarter-point hike in interest rates when Wednesday's meeting ends.


If a surprise does come on rates, either up by a bigger hike than expected or no change at all, a reaction would be likely.

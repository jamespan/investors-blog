  Indexes Close Near Highs In Resilient Session; Trump Backs Out Of Iran Deal

A busy day of headlines brought some sellers into the stock market Tuesday, but major stock indexes strengthened into the close.




The oil market was volatile ahead of President Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $69.06 a barrel, down 2.4%, after falling more than 4% at the day's low. As expected, Trump decided to pull out of the deal. That means that U.S. sanctions will be reimposed as well as possible new ones.


Overall, it was a constructive session for the stock market as major stock indexes closed near session highs.


Give the Nasdaq composite credit as it marked its third straight close above the 50-day moving average. It edged higher less than 0.1%, along with the Dow. But the 50-day line for the blue-chip index is still a resistance level to watch. It's also an issue for the S&P 500, which edged lower by less than 0.1%. The benchmark index marked its 13th straight close below the 50-day line Tuesday.

The Russell 2000 flexed its muscle again, with a 0.5% gain. It's less than 2% off its all-time high.


The IBD 50 performed in-line with the broad market. Outperformance came from names like **Broadridge Financial** ([BR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BR)), **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) and **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)). All three ended with gains of more than 3%.


Building-Related Stocks Fade After Earnings
-------------------------------------------


The price action of three building-related stocks — **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) and **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) — were a reminder to investors of how difficult it can be buying growth stocks when the market uptrend is under pressure.


LGI Homes soared 8% early on strong earnings, but sellers quickly came into the stock. Shares closed at 69.91, down nearly 8%. Tuesday's bearish action makes the stock damaged goods at this point.


Two other building-related names fared better on earnings but ended below buy points. **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) gapped out of a flat base with an entry at 120.50, hitting an intraday high of 125.93. But shares ended at 117.52. **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)), meanwhile gapped higher to the top of a flat base with an 82.36 entry. It hit an intraday high of 82.38, but shares closed at 78.34.


When it comes to new buys, half positions are generally better than full positions at this point. It's a good way to minimize risk in an uncertain market. That means invest only half what you'd normally would with any new purchase.

The stock market ended lower Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reversed from new highs, and a moderating trend continued in the main indexes.




Despite Thursday's disappointing finish, the stock market remains near record highs and four top growth stocks — **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Huntsman** ([HUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) — are in or near new buy zones.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


The Dow lost 0.2% after being up as much as 0.6% and at a record high for the second straight day. Its loss snapped a six-day win streak.


The S&P 500 declined 0.3%, its third consecutive decline. The Nasdaq fell less than 0.2% after erasing a 0.6% gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 inched lower as it too sold off late in the day.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP123021-278x300.jpg)Leading growth stocks also finished with modest losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) dropped 0.5% Thursday, giving back a part of Wednesday's 0.9% advance. The ETF of top growth stocks remains below the 200-day moving average after heavy losses in mid-December that worsened a downtrend from the Nov. 9 peak.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Harmony Biosciences** ([HRMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRMY)) is again trying to break out past a cup base's 44.49 buy point. Shares briefly topped the entry Thursday before closing below the buy point following the session's downside reversal.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE vs. Wednesday's session.

What To Do Now
--------------


The tech-heavy Nasdaq extended a two-day losing streak with modest losses Thursday, but remains squarely above the 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 hit record highs before reversing lower.


Despite Thursday's disappointing conclusion, the [market outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) is still in a "confirmed uptrend," and the amount of institutional selling remains light. The S&P 500 added a [new distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), making its total two, while the Nasdaq still has zero.


Investors have the green light to buy top-rated growth stocks breaking out past correct buy points. Continue to look for opportunities to raise your exposure, but be disciplined with your purchases and don't buy past the 5% buy zone.


In addition, make sure you're buying gradually. If the general market and your stocks continue to show strength, you can buy more aggressively. If the market and your stocks begin to weaken, you can move safely to the sidelines without risking too much of your portfolio.


After a four-day rally through Monday, the major indexes are moderating their advance. The Nasdaq, which jumped more than 3% last week, has a mild three-day losing streak. The S&P 500 has gone nowhere since Monday's 1.4% gain.


Certainly, the market was due to pause after one of the hottest four-day streaks of the year. But Thursday's negative reversals cloud the market just a bit.

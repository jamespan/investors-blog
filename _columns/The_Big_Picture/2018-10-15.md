Sellers Come Into Market Late As Former Leaders Take More Heat
===============================================================

A nascent rally attempt for the Nasdaq composite ran into some trouble Monday as tech stocks faced a fresh wave of selling.




The bulls hoped the Nasdaq would be able to extend gains after rising 2.3% Friday. It looked good for a short time when the Nasdaq turned slightly higher after falling 1.3% intraday, but it didn't take long for sellers to regain control. The index ended with a loss of 0.9%, hurt by a wave of selling during the final 30 minutes of trading.


It wasn't a great close for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500, either, as both ended near session lows. The Dow lost 0.4%, and the S&P 500 gave back 0.6%. Small caps performed well, with the Russell 2000 up 0.4%. Nasdaq volume fell, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Friday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MP101518.jpg)The Dow and S&P 500 held up relatively for most of the session despite a weak reading on [September retail sales](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/retail-sales-september-weak-amazon-thrives/) before the open. Overall, sales rose 0.1% in September, well below the consensus estimate of a 0.6% increase. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.1%, also below estimates for a 0.4% gain.


IBD 50 Strength
---------------


Weak retail sales didn't hinder the performance of several retail stocks in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) as names like **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) outperformed.


Ulta Beauty joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Friday after finding support at the 10-week moving average. It's also working on a big [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) base with a 290.40 entry.


Wingstop, meanwhile, jumped to a new high. Both Ulta and Wingstop are tempting buys in the current market, but with the market in a correction, new buys are especially risky. It's tough making money on the long side amid pretty clear signs of institutional selling.


When all is said and done, investors would be well served to follow a key IBD tenet that says: Don't let opinion tell you when to buy. Instead, let the market tell you when to buy. When new money starts coming in from the sidelines and a new market uptrend is confirmed, actionable charts shouldn't be too hard to find. They're not easy to find at the moment.


Tech Stocks Weak Again
----------------------


[FAANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) were weak across the board Monday, with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) leading the downside. Shares fell nearly 2% to 333.13 after Raymond James cut its price target to 400 from 445 ahead of its earnings report Tuesday after the close.


Netflix is now 21% off its high as it holds just above its 200-day moving average. Shares have seen several above-average volume price declines. That's a sign of least some institutional selling.


**Apple** ([APPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPL)) gave back 2% after Goldman Sachs made cautious comments about the company's China business.


When it comes to the price action of several former leaders, the bear argument definitely holds water. Take a look at **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), which fell another 4.5% Monday. A breakout from a later-stage base in August didn't get very far. It's now below its 200-day average along with a lot of other former leaders.


Meanwhile, several tech stocks lagged badly in the Nasdaq 100 Monday, including former leaders **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)). Adobe, Align and Autodesk are still holding above their 200-day lines, but the same can't be said for PayPal.


Earnings Season
---------------


Some are hoping a strong third-quarter earnings season will lift the market out of its recent malaise, but decent reports in the financial sector haven't stirred much enthusiasm.


Results from **Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)) are due Wednesday before the open. It's been a pillar of strength ahead of the results. It was featured as a call-option trade in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/options-trading/) column.

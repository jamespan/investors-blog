The major stock indexes ended lower Thursday and look headed for a mixed week, as stalled stimulus talks again took center stage. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tumbled as much as 1% before paring losses.




The Nasdaq fell almost 0.7%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.1%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.6%.


Leading growth stocks fell as well, yet generally outperformed for the day. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 0.6% on Thursday.


In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) advanced more than 1%, moving further above a 501.92 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) entry. On the downside, **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) descended 1.8% to fall further below a 84.56 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/).


Volume rose modestly from Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Stock Market Rally Hesitates
----------------------------


![MP111220_2](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MP111220_2-268x300.jpg)Midday Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he's not interested in "dramatically larger stimulus" regarding a coronavirus aid bill. That statement, along with rising coronavirus concerns, drove the indexes lower.


Despite the recent stock market rotation, the market trend remains in a confirmed uptrend.


Due to increases in volume vs. Wednesday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 added new [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) Thursday. That brings the Nasdaq's count up to two, while the S&P 500 likely added its one day of institutional selling.


Investors should continue to buy strong breakouts past [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/); however, discretion is advised. Previous Big Picture columns have emphasized the importance of starting slowly by wading into the new uptrend. If [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) start to work, then add exposure.


But, if breakouts start to fail, then back away.

Shares jumped more than 2% in extended trade.


Shares closed Thursday just below a 70 buy point in a [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) amid the day's 1.9% fall.


**Farfetch** ([FTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTCH)) surged more than 16% in extended trade, following the company's better-than-expected earnings and sales results.


The stock finished Thursday nearly 50% above a 28.91 entry in a [cup with handle,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) following an Oct. 23 breakout.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) reported a big beat in third-quarter revenue of $289.4 million, way past the consensus view of $279.4 million and up 52% vs. a year ago.

The hot IPO stock ended Thursday more than 25% above a 11.52 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).


Stocks To Watch: Futu, RH
-------------------------



IPO stock **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) is rapidly approaching a 41.09 buy point in a cup base amid Thursday's 7.6% advance. Shares are about 3% away from the new entry, but be on the lookout for a potential handle to offer a more risk-optimal buy point.


The top Chinese online broker [was featured](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-futu-stock-approaches-new-buy-point/) in this week's [IPO Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/).


**RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) reversed from strong gains to fall more than 4% Thursday, giving up a 404.87 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/). The [recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/rh-stock-nears-buy-point/) broke out on Wednesday, but today's weakness could spell trouble.


Bullishly, the stock's RS line is near new highs Thursday, marking RH as a potential stock market leader.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [RH stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-r-h-rh.aspx) boasts a 96 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). The Composite Rating — an easy way to identify top growth stocks — is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.

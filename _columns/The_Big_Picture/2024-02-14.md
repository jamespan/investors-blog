  Stock Market Rebounds Broadly; Will This Bullish Shift Continue?

The words "eclectic" and "breadth" may seem like a killer combination for a friendly game of Hangman or the tabletop classic Scrabble. Yet in the realm of the stock market, the pair also nicely fits the description of Wednesday's mostly bullish rebound.




A 1.3% rise by the Nasdaq composite cut short a sharp two-session drop, spurred of course by Tuesday's disappointing report on U.S. consumer prices. The Nasdaq's gain took back well more than half of Monday and Tuesday's combined 2.1% slide.


After the remarkable run by megacap techs in 2023, you might have assumed that they did the heavy lifting of Wednesday's gain, right? Well, actually no.


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), representing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the Nasdaq exchange, rose a hair under 1.1%. (QQQ ripped almost 54% higher in 2023.) Plus, a hefty rally of 2.4% by the Russell 2000 and a 1.4% upward move by the SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) gave more than a generous hint that Wednesday's rebound encompassed a much wider swath of the stock market than what was often seen last year.


Stock Market Today: What Rose Unusually
---------------------------------------


On days such as Wednesday, it may be enlightening for IBD readers to examine the day's strongest industry groups.


[Among the 197 industries tracked by IBD each day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), you certainly saw the tech sector contribute to the leadership. Preliminary data showed computer hardware and peripherals topping the list, up 9.8% on the day. Tons of credit, of course, goes to **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)), an expert in helping to transform the data center into the new nexus for AI and accelerated computing. Database software ranked in the top 10, rising 5.5% on a price-weighted basis.



[Yet at least 16 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) rallied 3% or more in the stock market today, far outperforming the general indexes. Is such information valuable for the ambitious stock picker? You bet, especially if you're looking for growth stocks with the potential to outstrip the returns of the stock market.


Solar energy, a laggard industry group currently, bolted 5.4% higher. **Nextracker** ([NXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXT)), a [topic of discussion in Wednesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), commands the group. Medical research equipment and services, automation machinery, health care services, RV and mobile building, movie and generic drug stocks also enjoyed robust gains.


The S&P 500, for sure, benefited from Wednesday's wide-ranging rebound. A nearly 1% gain lifted the large-cap index back above 5,000, closing at 5,000.62. It's now up 4.8% since Jan. 1.


Volume fell on both main exchanges. Perhaps some fund managers want to err on the side of caution ahead of [Friday's report on January producer level prices](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased 4 basis points to 4.26%. On Tuesday, the yield on the risk-free debt security hit 4.31%, the highest level since Dec. 1.


Distribution Day Analysis
-------------------------


![Market pulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MP021424-213x300.jpg)As the Market Pulse table shows, a [high distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) certainly can have a vexing feeling for many IBD readers. But how about the quality of that distribution?


Looking at each one of those five sessions for the S&P 500, it simply does not carry the same bite that distribution days showed back in late February to early March of 2020, or at the beginning of 2022. These two periods refer to the Covid pandemic and the Federal Reserve's resolve to fight inflation with a swift series of interest-rate hikes, respectively.


What about today? Among the five distribution days on the rolling 25-session count, two were stalling days. The Feb. 5 distribution was a 0.3% decline in higher volume. Only two of the five came in at 1% or more â€” a 1.6% backtrack on Jan. 31, and a 1.4% slide on Tuesday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged other stock market indexes with a 0.4% gain Wednesday. At least 10 of the blue chip index's 30 components rallied 1 point or more. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which had the second largest point gain, rose 1% to 409.49 and stayed on the north side of its 21-day exponential moving average. Same technical action, more or less, occurred for **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), also up 1%.


Without question, most of the Dow Jones industrial stocks lag true stock market leaders. The median [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) within the index is unsavory at 69 on a scale of 1 to 99. However, at least 12 of the Dow stocks carry an RS Rating of 80 or higher.


Positive Breadth In Stock Market
--------------------------------


Winners trounced losers on the NYSE by a nearly 4-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, gainers outpaced decliners by more than 3 to 1.


It wasn't just "bulge bracket" financial firms on Wall Street that did well on Wednesday.


Smaller banking stocks are still generally underperforming. Yet the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) ETF rallied 1.9%. It still has quite a lot work left to rebound back above the 50-day moving average, however.


Keeping a close eye on sector performance is vital to finding the true stock market winners. That's always been the mission of IBD's stock research tables.


Headed into Wednesday's action, at least six of the 33 sectors boasted a gain of at least 5% year to date. Beyond technology, they include Apparel (up 16.4% through Tuesday), Transportation (up 6.7%) and Miscellaneous (up 9.4%). Please be sure to click on the sector names, and you can quickly scan the components of each sector, spotting those with a strong [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) or an excellent [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/).

Sentiment Today
---------------


Optimism is clearly rising in the stock market. But it's still not clear if Wall Street has hit giddy levels. In moments of extreme giddiness, it usually means that practically all stock market participants are now long in equities, hoping for more gains. With no one left to buy, it usually marks the beginning of at least a significant market pullback.


Bullishness among newsletter editors rose to a 30-month high at 58.8% vs. 54.3% last week, according to [Investors Intelligence](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/). Since one newsletter editor turned negative, the ratio of bearishness edged up to 17.7% vs. 17.1% the prior week.


"The remaining bears hold lots of cash and question the accuracy of positive economic data," the research firm wrote. "They note the narrow tech leadership. Low levels of bears (near 18% in July/August 2023, just 15.3% in July 2021) hint at tops. In contrast, the bears hit 44.1% in early October, equaling their mid-June 2022 peak. The best broad buying chances occur with those lofty bear counts, which suggest most have exited equity positions."

The stock market sold off hard again Friday ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. A weak earnings report and 14% plunge for **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) fueled negative sentiment, while a strong rally in [Chinese stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) did little to help the Nasdaq composite.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) tried to rally after earnings but got turned away at its 50-day moving average again. A 1.6% early gain faded to a loss of nearly 4% by the close. Apple reported solid results, but the company [forecast a revenue hit of up to $8 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-china-shutdowns-weigh-on-outlook/) in the current quarter due to Covid shutdowns in China and supply constraints.

The stock market weighed more inflationary data before the open. The core personal consumption expenditures index, one of the Fed's preferred inflation gauges, increased 5.2% in March, a little below the Econoday consensus of 5.3%. Overall, prices were up 6.6%, just below the 6.8% consensus.


The two-day Fed meeting concludes Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 0.75% to 1%. There's a very good chance of another 50-basis-point hike at the June meeting.

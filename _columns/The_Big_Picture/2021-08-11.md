  Stock Market Holds Firm As Some Growth Stocks Struggle; Unity Software Scores Powerful Breakout

The rotation trade was on display for the second straight day in the stock market Wednesday. Several top-rated growth stocks fell hard as industrial, financial and materials stocks outperformed. But the weakness in growth stocks didn't find its way into the Nasdaq composite, which closed modestly lower and off session lows.




Overall, the stock market was encouraged by a tame reading on [U.S. consumer prices](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-undershoots-expectations-dow-jones-record-high/) before the open. An early rise in the 10-year Treasury bond yield fueled some early selling in the Nasdaq, but the index closed off lows, ending with a loss of nearly 0.2%.


The 10-year yield snapped a six-session win streak, falling 1 basis point to 1.34%. The 50-day moving average for the 10-year yield — currently around 1.38% — is a potential resistance level to watch.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Small caps perked up, with the Russell 2000 up 0.5%. The small-cap index has been trading below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) since mid-July.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the way and marked another all-time closing high, rising 0.6%. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) was the top gainer in the blue-chip index, rising 3.5%. After an earnings sell-off, CAT stock is back above its 50-day moving average, but it still has more work to do to form the right side of its [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).



**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) was another strong performer in the Dow Jones ahead of next week's earnings report. The home improvement retailer gained 1.7% and topped a 333.55 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [shallow cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in light turnover.


![MP081121-](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP081121--258x300.jpg)The coming week will be busy in terms of retail earnings reports. Dow component **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) reports early Tuesday. It's near the top of a 37-week consolidation, but a long period of sideways movement has resulted in a lagging [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/).


The S&P 500 tacked on nearly 0.3%. **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) was a top gainer in the index, up 5% to 357.50. It cleared a 14-week [consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/) with a 354.70 buy point.


Preliminary data showed lower volume on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, volume fell by less than 0.1% vs. Tuesday. The Nasdaq's July 7 [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) fell off the count, which lowers the Nasdaq's [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) count to 4.


What's made the stock market challenging in recent weeks is the back-and-forth rotation out of growth stocks and into industrial and cyclical names.


Stock indexes continue to hold near highs, but growth stocks in favor one day — and out of favor the next — have made it difficult for growth portfolios to make meaningful headway.

A well-constructed portfolio at this point might have a mix of industrial and cyclical stocks with some select growth stocks that are holding up well.


IBD 50 Pares Losses
-------------------


After reversing lower Tuesday for a loss of 0.8%, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) pared a 2% intraday loss to 0.5%.


**Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) was a bright spot in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks. The AI-driven loan analytics company soared 26% after reporting bullish earnings and revenue growth. Tight, sideways trading from here could result in a new buy point. But 10 IBD 50 stocks fell 2% or more, with **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), **Kulicke & Soffa** ([KLIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLIC)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) leading the downside.


The [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) delivered breakouts from the likes of **Textainer** ([TGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGH)) and **Crane Co**. ([CR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CR)). The latter was featured in Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cr-stock-industrial-products-maker-crane-is-in-buy-zone/).


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment among stock market newsletter writers rose in the latest week, but it's still not at extreme levels. The latest data from Investors Intelligence showed bullish sentiment rising to 56.4% in the latest week, up slightly from 54.1% the prior week. Bullish sentiment topped the key 60% level during the first three weeks of April just ahead of a sharp pullback for the Nasdaq composite.


In the steel producers group, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) extended gains after recent breakouts. Both stocks are top holdings of the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF ([XME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XME)), which joined [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) on July 29. After clearing a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 44.19 buy point, XME topped an alternate handle buy point of 45.99.



**Unity Software** ([U](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=U)) [joined Leaderboard Wednesday](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) when it was breaking out of a [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/google-stock-breakout-from-bottoming-base-in-2009-yielded-perfect-entry/) with a conventional entry of 150.60. The stock closed near its session high, up 13% to 121.35. The company isn't profitable yet, but sales growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, up 48% to $273.6 million.

The stock market finished sharply mixed Thursday, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes extended their losing streaks. Meanwhile, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) declined in extended trade after [crushing Wall Street's targets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-nflx-q1-2024-earnings-q2-outlook/) for the first quarter but missing views with its sales outlook.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.5%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq extended their losing streaks to five sessions, falling further below their 50-day moving averages.


The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%, falling for a fifth straight day.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session. That added a new distribution day to the S&P 500, taking its total to 10.

Dow Jones component **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was among the biggest winners, rallying 3%. UnitedHealth is back above its 50-day line, but still 10% off its 52-week high. On the downside, **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) extended this week's losses, falling 1.6%. Shares are sharply below their 50-day line.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was the biggest loser, with a 3.6% drop, hitting a new 52-week low. Meanwhile, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) rebounded 1.5%, ending a four-day losing streak and bouncing off the 50-day line. Keep in mind that new purchases carry more risk in a difficult market environment.


And top growth stocks declined, as the Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund lost 0.6%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Oscar Health** ([OSCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OSCR)) jumped 5.8%, moving up the right side of a cup base that has a 18.55 entry.


What To Do In Today's Stock Market
----------------------------------


After Thursday's mixed action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remained below their 50-day benchmarks. Thus, IBD is maintaining its market outlook at "uptrend under pressure" with a recommended exposure level at 20%-40%.


In another sign of weak market conditions, only 19.4% of Nasdaq stocks are above their 50-day lines, the lowest percentage since early November, [according to Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/indices/nasdaq/nasdaq-composite?viewName=main).


Meanwhile, a number of stock market leaders have flashed sell signals in recent sessions, including **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), Salesforce and **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).

To help reduce your exposure to stocks, sell your losers and take some profits in the winners. Be sure to follow sell rules, including selling any stock that drops 7% or more from your purchase price.


During [Thursday's "IBD Live" show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), the team discussed that raising cash and getting defensive seems to be the best path to take, while waiting for confirmation of the next uptrend.


It's a good time to watch for stocks that are holding up with relative strength, because they could form bases amid the pullback and become leaders in the next uptrend.


In [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list Thursday, **Badger Meter** ([BMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMI)) jumped past a 164.81 cup-with-handle entry.


Keep track of emerging bases with the [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Near Pivot" list. Currently, it shows only a handful of stocks. For example, **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) is approaching a 200.64 buy point in a flat base.

Market Leaders And Magnificent Seven
------------------------------------



**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), along with **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), are among the best stocks to watch in the recent stock market weakness.


Google parent Alphabet is in buy range above a 153.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) following an April 1 breakout move, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


Nvidia shares built a flat base that shows a 974 buy trigger. A decisive rebound from its 50-day line would also place the artificial intelligence leader in a new buy area.


Datadog is tracing a flat base that shows a 138.61 entry. More aggressive investors could also use 131.58 as an earlier entry, but the stock is back below the 50-day line.


Dexcom shares are hovering in the 5% buy area past a 132.03 flat-base entry.

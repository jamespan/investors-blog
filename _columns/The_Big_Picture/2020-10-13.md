  Growth Stocks Grab Limelight In An Otherwise Constructive Day In The Stock Market

The Nasdaq traded like a seesaw. The S&P 500 attempted a late-afternoon push to reach positive ground but failed by day's end. And the Russell 2000 snapped a four-day winning streak.




Yet for stock market bulls, you perhaps couldn't have asked more from a down session. Growth stocks performed well.


You can witness this not only within the accompanying Market Pulse table: Check out the [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full). A look at the top 10-ranked names reveals at least four names that rose 0.5% or more for the day, led by **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), a half-size position in [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


PayPal, a megacap at $243 billion in market value and 1.17 billion shares outstanding, muscled 3% higher to come within an arm's length of its 212.45 peak. The member of IBD's payment processors group is now forming a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) base.



A 0.1% decline for the Nasdaq, just a day after it marked a [new follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-signals-positive-as-nasdaq-rallies-higher-volume/) of its own on Monday, painted a bullish picture in more than a few ways. First, that tiny drop came after the tech-driven composite index ramped up as much as 7.2% over a four-day stretch of gains. Second, the Nasdaq [etched an inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/) on its daily chart.


The inside day indicated large money managers did not feel pressed to buy hard or sell with abandon. Nasdaq volume fell.


The S&P 500 got tagged with a fresh [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), falling 0.6% in higher NYSE turnover vs. Monday. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF backtracked nearly 0.7%. Yet the small-cap ETF still boasts a thick air pocket above its rising [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).

How Growth Stocks Fared TodayMP101320_2
---------------------------------------


Meanwhile, Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed. The growth stock-focused ETF gained 0.3% and hit an all-time closing high. That came despite a 13% sell-off in **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)), discussed in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).


Nearly 20 stocks have found a home in two key lists on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). Meanwhile, two have a spot on the [Leaderboard watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist). **Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)), discussed in [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wayfair-stock-approaching-new-buy-point/), is one of them.


Was This Important News?
------------------------


The launch of [Amazon Prime Day](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-prime-day-date-sales-amzn/) and the [debut of new 5G-ready iPhones](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/iphone-12-debuts-apple-product-launch-event/) certainly drove strong interest on the worldwide web. But what about the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index? If you are a student of the market, you'd benefit greatly from watching this monthly barometer of important economic activity.


Back in 2008, well before institutions really raced for the exits as the subprime debt debacle on Wall Street went into full bloom, the NFIB index had fallen substantially into weak territory. It has proved valuable as a leading economic indicator, not a lagging one.


Fast-forward to the third quarter of 2020. The September figure of 104, up from 100.2 in August and head and shoulders above the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 100.9, offers an upbeat note on the general economic recovery even as coronavirus cases still rise in the U.S. and swell in countries such as Russia, India and Brazil.


In May, the NFIB Small Business Optimism gauge plummeted to 90.9 from 96.4 the prior month.


Don't Buy Laggards
------------------


Bank stocks have not been participating as leaders in the current rebound.



**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) is down 0.4% for the week after announcing Q3 results early Tuesday. Good news: The bank reported a solid profit of $2.92 a share, up 9% vs. a year earlier and well ahead of Wall Street views. Smaller loan-loss reserves helped. Bad news: Revenue dropped 15% to $30.8 billion. That proved an even deeper decline than in Q1 (-9%) and Q2 (-2%).


Top growth stocks in leading sectors — not lagging ones — position themselves best for breakouts from [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) to new highs.


Headed into Tuesday's trading, Auto, Software, Chips, Building and Retail took five of the top six slots inside the [33-sector IBD stock tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-12-2020/) based on mid- and long-term relative price performance. Banks ranked No. 32, S&Ls No. 33.

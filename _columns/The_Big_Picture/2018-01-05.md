U.S. stock indexes sprinted higher Friday, extending their 2018 win streak and improving their technical picture.




 The Dow rose 0.9%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively.


Volume fell on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.


The distribution day count improved significantly. The Nov. 29 distribution on the Nasdaq fell off because of time. The Dec. 4 distribution on the Nasdaq fell off because of price gains.


Bulls controlled the narrative Friday, even if some of the financial data missed estimates badly.


Payrolls for December missed the target by 22%. But the November payrolls number was revised upward by about 10%.


The manufacturing jobs number for December soared 67% above views.


The bears might have woke up Friday thinking the headline payrolls number would give the stock market reason to pause. Instead, the market kept its 2018 performance a perfect four up days vs. zero down days.


A Holder's Market
-----------------


While the stock market indexes have kept rising, it's been more of a holder's market. Those who bought shares in quality stocks months ago are padding the gains. But new money is having a more challenging time.

On Friday, there were a few exceptions.


Small cap **Kraton** ([KRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRA)), which is in the Chemicals-Plastics group, rose 1.92 to 52.72 in volume 50% above average. The stock crossed a 51.33 buy point. However, the base is third stage, which is more prone to failure.


**Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) gapped up 5% in strong volume Friday, padding a recent breakout. The stock gained 22% for the week.


On the negative side, India-based **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) and alcoholic beverage provider **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) unwound recent mild breakouts.


The Proper Stance
-----------------


Where does this leave the individual investor? Here are two items to keep in mind.


First, the stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend and it has shown an ability to handle adverse financial news. Yet, a pullback would be no surprise. Watch to see how the market reacts if that happens. Ideally, bulls want to see soft trade on a pullback.


Second, hold where possible, but be careful with new buys. Until breakouts begin to spread, boldness is not appropriate.

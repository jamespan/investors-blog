===============================================================

The stock market ended the week with quiet action Friday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit more record highs. But small caps underperformed.




Tech leaders **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) held in new buy zones after recent breakouts.


The Nasdaq closed less than 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 moved up 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher. And the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.9%.


Leading growth stocks showed solid losses, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 0.8% Friday. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) broke out past a 191.99 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), surging more than 14% Friday to close at 203.29. The 5% buy zone goes up to 201.59, so the stock is already extended.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared lower on the NYSE compared with Thursday's numbers.![MP081321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP081321-260x300.jpg)

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Snap, Tesla
------------------------------------



[IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/leaderboard-10-year/) stock Snap fell again. Yet it held above a 73.69 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) in a consolidation following a July 23 breakout, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. That day, Snap surged almost 24% following a [second-quarter earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-soars-on-second-quarter-earnings/) that toppled estimates and revenue more than doubling, plus an outlook that also beat views.


However, progress has been slow and the stock hasn't made any progress. Snap stock is in theÂ [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) that tops out at 77.37. Shares lost nearly 0.9% Friday, closing at 74.62.



[IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock Tesla continues to hold above a 700.10 aggressive buy point. The EV giant is trying to clear the short-term resistance level, but remains around 20% below the base's peak of 900.40. Tesla, also in Leaderboard, recently found support at the 40-week line on its weekly chart. Tesla stock dipped 0.7%, closing at 717.17.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [Tesla stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-inc-tsla.aspx) shows a 92 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/).

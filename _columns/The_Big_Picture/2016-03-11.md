Stock indexes coasted to big gains Friday, but volume retreated for the fourth time in five sessions.


The Nasdaq popped 1.9%, while the S&P 500 added 1.6%. The small-cap S&P 600 outperformed with a 2.1% gain. The IBD 50 advanced 2%.


Volume fell on both major exchanges. After bulking up weekly volume for three weeks, trade fell last week on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.


Part of the decline may be tied to the calendar.


![MP031116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP031116-1-199x300.jpg)The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and that often fosters a wait-and-see attitude. A change in rates, however, isn’t expected. CME Group’s FedWatch gauge puts the probability of a rate hike at 0% and a rate cut at 4%.


Over the past four weeks, action has been constructive in the major indexes. The S&P 500 has retaken its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The Nasdaq has retaken its 50-day line but remains under the 200-day line. With the S&P 500 reaching its 200-day line, which is still trending downward, that becomes a key test for the market in the new week.


Since the indexes' closing lows Feb. 11, the small-cap S&P 600 has advanced 14%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 11% each.


Bears might expect a pullback after the quick gains, but bulls could argue that the recent 2.9% pullback in the Nasdaq served as a minor blowoff.


On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio closed at 1.21. When the ratio hits 1.15 or higher, it sometimes accurately signals that a short-term low is near. The last time the put-call volume ratio closed above 1.15 was Feb. 8. Three sessions later, the low came.


The current uptrend has had its problems. Leading stocks have been hesitant after breakouts and even after breakaway gaps.


A breakaway gap occurs when a stock opens the day higher than the prior day’s trading range and in strong volume. The leap leaves white space on the chart, and is a powerfully bullish signal.


Since the Feb. 11 lows in the major indexes, a couple of handfuls of stocks have scored breakaway gaps, including -- **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)), **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and **Universal Electronics** ([UEIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UEIC)).


The problem is that strong follow-up action after the gap-up has been scarce. This isn’t necessarily deadly. Sometimes a stock needs time before finding additional thrust. Also, sideways action can be a sign of institutional support.


On Friday, several quality stocks cleared buy points. Chip designer **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) broke past a 34.08 buy point in strong volume. Retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) gapped up 17% to leap over a 188.58 buy point in huge volume. **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) flew past a 78.59 buy point, but volume was only 20% above average.


For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.1%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 600 added 0.7% each. The IBD 50 gained 0.9%.


Given the mixed picture -- breakouts with hesitant follow-up action -- individual investors should mirror that hesitation. Patience makes sense if a stock has strong fundamentals, hasn't flashed any sell signals and is making modest progress. However, the investor doesn't want to load up a portfolio with iffy issues.


Try not to get any more bullish than the stock market itself.

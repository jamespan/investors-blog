Was Tuesday's Rally A Stock Market Bottom? Some Old Faces Now Lead IBD 50
==========================================================================

The stock market shed its fears Tuesday, as indexes rose sharply a day after hitting the lowest levels since July.




While it was a good day, consider it only the first step in a possible bottoming phase. The next few days will offer more clear signals.


Indexes trimmed gains in the final 45 minutes of trading. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and appeared lower on the NYSE. In a perfect scenario, volume would increase to support the index gains, and indexes would rally into the close.


You might have also expected better breadth. On Tuesday, advancers beat decliners by less than 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Stock Market Tries For A Bottom
-------------------------------


Still, the stock market is trying to get back on its feet.Â It sure helped that some of the tech Goliaths performed so well.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) vaulted more than 5% to a new high. The [sudden popularity of South Korea's "Squid Show"](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-riding-high-on-squid-game-buzz/) and other new programming fed bullish sentiment. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) bounced more than 2% even as the platform [faced a grilling in a Senate hearing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-hearing-spurs-call-for-tighter-grip-on-social-network/) that featured a company whistleblower.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP100521-233x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3% as the technology sector rebounded. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) rose 1.4%.


The S&P 500 had been up as much as 1.6% and closed 1.1% higher, thanks in part to strength in financials. That sector was Tuesday's best, up 2% after the 10-year Treasury note's yield added 5 basis points to 1.53%.


Financial Select Sector SPDR ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) was added to IBD Leaderboard Tuesday in a rare ETF addition for this product.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%.


IBD 50 Outperforms Stock Market
-------------------------------


The IBD 50 climbed 1.5%, bouncing after falling almost to its 200-day moving average. Some stocks that had been out of favor for months are reemerging as IBD 50 leaders.


**Focus Financial Partners** ([FOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCS)), which had been consolidating since February, broke out of a long [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) with a 54.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/). Its relative strength line is near new highs, a good sign.


**Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) surged nearly 8% as it forms a four-month-old base. **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)), slumping since March, jumped 6%. **Tandem Diabetes Care** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)), is testing the 10-week moving average. The stock broke out of a 43-week base about four weeks ago.



**CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)) is forming a choppy cup with handle that now dates some 34 weeks. It's one of several auto-seller stocks performing relatively better lately. **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)), **Penske Automotive** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)) and **Sonic Automotive** ([SAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAH)) (today's [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-sonic-near-buy-point-q2-results-cruise-past-wall-street-targets/)) are also in the IBD 50.


How To Evaluate Stock Market
----------------------------


While Tuesday's rally was a positive step for a wobbly stock market, it certainly didn't change the overall outlook. IBD's market outlook remains "market in correction."


Indexes have to show they can expand on the rebound. Remember, the stock market made a good bounce on Friday, yet it quickly went back to its losing ways on Monday.


This week, it's important to judge each day's action.


Watch for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to hold above Monday's lows. A drop below that level, and forget about a rally confirmation happening this week.


Even if the Nasdaq or S&P 500 keep rising the next couple of days, it may not mean much. The stock market needs at least a few days of progress before investors should feel confident about getting back into stocks.


What To Do Before Stock Market Turns
------------------------------------


Until the market outlook changes, investors should be polishing their watchlists. A solid market bottom will cause breakouts among the new market leaders.


Today, financial, energy and some auto stocks have held up.


The market this week faces more uncertainty, with a jobs report due Friday morning. Earnings season starts next week. Already, the stock market is nervous about spending proposals in Washington, the possible collapse of major real estate firm China Evergrande Group and the spread of Covid-19 hot spots.

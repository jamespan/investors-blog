Are The Bulls Preparing To Run In The Stock Market?
====================================================

The stock market showed true grit Wednesday, with the major indexes largely building on the previous session's lion-size gains.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 advanced 0.8% each, while the Nasdaq added 0.6%. Small caps, as gauged in the Russell 2000, inched down 0.1%.


Volume faded on both major exchanges.


Declining volume was a concern for the second day in a row. For the most part, funds appear willing to wait.


What are they waiting for? At least five things are possibilities:


Five Possibilities
------------------


**No. 1**, a resolution to the tariff and immigration battle with Mexico. The New York Times reported that Vice President Mike Pence was meeting Wednesday with Mexico Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard in an attempt to resolve the issues. Tariffs could be imposed as early as Monday.


**No. 2**, the trade standoff with China appears stalled with no breakthrough imaginable for now. China didn't help matters Wednesday when a government agency announced it would fine a **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) joint venture in China to the tune of $23.6 million, accusing Ford of setting minimum resale prices on vehicles. The move comes a few days after announcing **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) was under investigation for misrouting packages.

The software sector dropped from [No. 1 among 33 sectors to No. 4](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jun-04-2019/), going into Wednesday's session. Software has held the No. 1 spot for 18 weeks in a row. Investors will be watching to see if this is just a blip on the sector screen or a real change. Sectors moving ahead of software were telecom, food and beverage, and the building sector.


But as today's Market Pulse shows, several top-rated enterprise software stocks were moving up in strong volume Wednesday, a good sign.


**No. 4**, the Federal Reserve is expected to eventually cut interest rates. But CME Group's FedWatch Tool still sees a roughly 75% chance that rates will be held steady at the June 19 meeting. The gauge expects a rate cut in late July.


**No. 5**, on a smaller scale, IBD-style investors are waiting for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). The market has not yet satisfied all the conditions for an uptrend confirmation.


A Check Of The Technicals
-------------------------


On the plus side, some market technicals have already been satisfied. The indexes have retaken their 200-day lines, though they are still 2% to 4% below the 50-day lines.


Going into Wednesday's session, the major indexes' Accumulation/Distribution Ratings were at a lowest-possible E. This can be an advantage. History shows that some of the best rallies come after a follow-through day with an E rating. Apparently, a market with an E distribution rating has shaken out most of the weak holders.


Also, the new highs count retook its advantage over new lows Tuesday and kept the advantage Wednesday. This was the first time new highs held the edge since May 21.


Crude Oil Heads South
---------------------


Crude oil fell more than 3% Wednesday, pulling the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil to $51.75 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration reported a surge in domestic stockpiles.


The price of light sweet crude is now about 33% off its October high. So far, there have been two waves down — one from early October to Christmas Eve and a second from late April to the current level. Major corrections often involve three waves down. But it doesn't necessarily have to happen that way.

Small Caps Thrive; 3 Stock Groups Poised For Rotation
======================================================

U.S. stock indexes stepped lightly Thursday, but small caps made a deep footprint on the upside.


The Nasdaq trotted ahead 0.4%, but the Nasdaq 100 (the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the composite) rose only 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched up less than 0.1%. Instead, it was the small caps that shined, as the Russell 2000 hustled 1.4% higher.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

After five weeks, a distribution day is no longer relevant to current conditions. The count is remarkably light now, which has to be reassuring to the bulls.


Despite the buzz surrounding Thursday's testimony of former FBI chief James Comey, testimony in which he called President Trump a liar, the market showed little concern. Presidents have lied in the past and that by itself is not an impeachable offense.


As if to underline that, the Trump trade was showing renewed strength.


Banks rallied. Private prison real estate investment trusts rallied. And concrete stocks rallied.


In November, all three groups found thrust in the aftermath of Trump's election victory. But then they pulled back. The money center group fell 12% off its high, and the cement group about 16%. The two groups are now 8% to 5% off their highs, putting many of the stocks in position to complete bases and break out.


Recently two of the three Trump trades received encouraging news.


This week Trump affirmed his desire to reach an infrastructure deal with Congress. Meanwhile, the House is poised to vote on killing the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, which is on the wish list of many banks. Eliminating the fiduciary rule is also in the House bill, according to the New York Times.


As for the third item, private prison companies need no reminder that two-thirds of immigrant detainees are in private prisons. The Trump administration is planning to add more violators to the prisons and keep them there until violators are deported.


On Thursday, big gainers in the Trump trade included megacap bank **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), which rose 2% as it cleared a 62.63 buy point; construction aggregates and cement provider **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)), up 2% as it tries to complete a flat base on base; and private prison **Geo Group** ([GEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GEO)), which popped 4% as it retook its 50-day line.


The interesting thing is here is the potential for sector rotation.


These kind of stocks — banks, prisons and cement — have been struggling for weeks and sometimes months. The three aforementioned stocks fell as much as 10% to 16% off their spring highs. But they have quietly recovered, and now are 2% to 7% off highs, except for Citigroup, which is at a new high and has topped a buy point.


Is this a head fake before a new plunge for the Trump trade? Or is it the beginning of something good? The IBD investor lets the market answer that question. He or she can buy a breakout. If it works, hang on. If it doesn't, sell but keep the loss small.

The stock market rebound exerted more energy Monday, as the major indexes saw improvement in their charts. But more potential pitfalls lie ahead.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 had their best gains of the month so far. More importantly, both closed back above their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% and the S&P 0.7%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.3% and remained below its 50-day line. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) contributed about 40 of the Dow's 87-point gain.


Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 rose only 0.2%. Doing just the opposite of the main indexes, the Russell closed near session lows.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and NYSE from Friday's totals, which gave Monday's market gains more heft. Nasdaq advancers edged decliners by about 300 Monday. On the NYSE, gainers also had a slight advantage.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MP091123-229x300.jpg)The IBD 50 rose 0.8%. Newcomer **GigaCloud Technology** ([GCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GCT)) led with an 8.1% gain in heavy trading.


Monday's action in the major indexes and leading stocks left the market in better shape than last week. Still, the stock market is living day to day, with headlines influencing much of the trading.


Lacking further bullish signs, IBD's market outlook remains at "uptrend under pressure" with a recommended exposure level of 20%-40%.


This week, three events will help shape the market's short-term direction.


Key Events For Stock Market This Week
-------------------------------------


Tuesday morning, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is having its [annual product event](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/), when it's expected to introduce the next models of its iPhone family plus other product updates. In the past, the event has been a catalyst for Apple shares and for its ecosystem of suppliers.


On average, Apple shares fall 0.2% on the day of its iPhone introductions, according to research from Dow Jones Market Data. But from the time of the announcement to product release, Apple shares rise 2.8% on average.


The stock could surely use a positive investor reaction this week. Shares Monday spent a fourth straight day below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Once a growth darling, Apple's EPS ranged from -10% to +5% the past six quarters. Sales have been slowing.


Inflation Data Greets Stock Market Wednesday
--------------------------------------------


On Wednesday morning, the August consumer price index becomes the next measurement of inflation. Economists [expect an increase of 0.6%](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=559233&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) from the previous month and 3.6% on an annual basis. Those would be higher readings than in the July report.


But core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, are expected to edge up 0.2%, equaling the July increase. Year over year, the consensus core CPI estimate is 4.4%. On Thursday, the producer price index will offer another look at price trends.


The CPI report comes as the Federal Reserve [appears to be shifting its thinking](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/an-important-shift-in-fed-officials-rate-stance-is-under-way-70a91f8a), growing more sensitive about tightening too much, *The Wall Street Journal* reported.


Also on Thursday, a big test for the IPO market and the chip sector arrives with the expected [debut of Arm on the Nasdaq](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/arm-ipo-could-open-door-for-more-tech-stock-offerings/).


The semiconductor design firm plans to sell 95.5 million shares priced $47 to $51, for a valuation of $50.2 billion to $54.5 billion. Arm, which will trade under the symbol ARM, should be one of the biggest IPOs of the year.


Magnificent 7 Do Their Share
----------------------------


One reason the stock market did better Monday was because some of the biggest stocks acted well. Indeed, the S&P 500 would have performed much weaker if it hadn't been for its big caps. **Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF** ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) rose less than 0.2%.


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged 10% on a [bullish note from Morgan Stanley](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-given-upgrade-on-supercomputer-adding-half-a-trillion-dollars-in-value/). Analyst Adam Jonas upgraded Tesla to overweight and raised the price target to 400. Jonas gushed about Tesla's Dojo, a supercomputer built to train self-driving technology. The EV company is Morgan Stanley's top pick.


Tesla stock cleared a trendline entry around 257. It also gapped above its 50-day moving average in heavy trading.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is looking splendid. The stock is forming a flat base and closed quite near to a 143.63 buy point. Amazon added 3.5%. **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) rose 3.3%.

Stock Market Falls As It Looks To Fed Meeting; These Are The Trouble Spots
===========================================================================

If the stock market gets its customary Santa Claus Rally this month, it may come in split fashion.




Indexes are diverging, and after a period of outperformance, many leading stocks are again faltering.


Although the S&P 500 lost 0.9% Monday, it is still trading near record highs. On Friday, it made a new closing high. Its advance-decline line is rebounding.


But the Nasdaq composite met resistance around its 16,000 level and is now more than 4% below the Nov. 22 peak. The composite is nearing a new test of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). The index fell 1.4% Monday as indexes closed at session lows.


Although more than half the Nasdaq consists of tech stocks, that's not necessarily the index's main headache. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) made a new high Monday, before giving back gains.

The iShares Expanded-Tech Software ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) is more than 9% below prior highs. Cybersecurity and enterprise software are chief culprits in the software sector. Those industry groups are off about 11% and 18%, respectively, from prior highs.


Biotechs, Growth Stocks Hurt Stock Market
-----------------------------------------


Biotechs, another Nasdaq-heavy industry, continue to slump. The iShares Biotech ETF ([IBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBB)) is nearly 16% off its August peak. The Philadelphia semiconductor index is performing better than the software index, yet it slid 2.6% Monday.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was a major loser, down nearly 7% in busy trading. The chip designer is now trying to find support at the 10-week moving average. **Kulicke & Soffa** ([KLIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLIC)), a chip equipment company, plunged 13.7% in more than double its usual volume. Last week, it was drawing near a buy point.


Another way to put all this: Growth stocks are out of favor.


The IBD 50 fell 2.4% Monday and extended a monthlong downtrend. That trend picked up momentum in the past couple of weeks â€” even while the stock market rebounded from its post-Thanksgiving slide. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) sold off 3.4% Monday and could undercut last week's low.


Kulicke & Soffa, **Alpha & Omega Semiconductor** ([AOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOSL)), **MP Materials** ([MP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MP)), **Lovesac** ([LOVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOVE)) and **Trupanion** ([TRUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRUP)) fell 7% or more in the IBD 50. The fact that just last week these stocks looked to be forming fine [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) helps illustrate the risk with growth stocks today.


The Russell 2000 is piling up losses too, shedding 1.4% Monday. With the index now more than 11% below its Nov. 8 high, small caps are another weak spot in the stock market.


Stock Market Uptrend Still Possible
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain in attempted rallies and still could make a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) any day now. But as long as growth and leading stocks are not participating, it's difficult to imagine a bottoming signal happening.


That's not to say a new stock market uptrend is off the table. Rather, investors may need to be patient for a follow-through. If the stock market makes a low, it doesn't necessarily need all sectors to be rebounding.


Just like health scientists are trying to figure out how dangerous the omicron variant is, the stock market is going through its own period of discovery as it faces big questions.


How soon will supply-chain problems last? Can companies find enough workers? How long until inflation starts to ease? When will the Fed start raising interest rates?


On that last question, the stock market could get some hints Wednesday, at the conclusion of the [Federal Reserve's policy meeting](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-stock-market-ready-for-faster-taper-but-not-this/). Investors also will be watching for any acceleration in the taper of bond purchases.


Chairman Jerome Powell and other top Fed officials have suggested the program may need to wind down quicker than planned. Wall Street would not want to be surprised.


On Monday, the 10-year Treasury note's yield fell nearly 7 basis points to 1.42%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE.

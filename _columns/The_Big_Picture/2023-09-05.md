  Stocks Fall Broadly As Market Enters This Dreadful Period

Stocks continued to seek direction Tuesday, ending a seesaw session lower as commodity and bond markets impacted equities.




After the best two-week run since March, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell. The Nasdaq closed with minimal change for a third straight session as battle lines are drawn at its 14,000 level.


The S&P 500 dropped 0.4%, for the fourth consecutive change of 0.4% or less. A standoff is unfolding at its 4,500 level. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).


Small caps tumbled 2.1%, easily the worst of the major indexes. After regaining the 50-day moving average Friday, the Russell 2000 abruptly fell right back below it.


The IBD 50 fell 0.2%.


There was a strange mix of stocks both up and down in heavy volume. On the upside, energy, tech and some consumer stocks stood out.


While many stocks remain above buy points, some are burning through the calories they consumed over the past several weeks. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), **McKesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)), **YPF** ([YPF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YPF)), **PGT Innovations** ([PGTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PGTI)) and **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) are some that could go back to their buy points, or already have.


Yields, Oil, China, Eurozone Hit U.S. Stocks
--------------------------------------------


Another jump in Treasury yields seemed to rattle the stock market. The 10 year yield rose 9 basis points to nearly 4.27%. That's an almost 18 basis point jump in two sessions, hoisting the benchmark yield back above the 4% mark.

Russia and Saudi Arabia surprisingly extended output cuts through the end of the year. Oil prices rose to their highest levels of the year.


Brent crude climbed 1.2% to $90.04 a barrel. Nymex crude for October delivery extended its win streak to eight sessions, up 1.3% to $86.69 per barrel. Its win streak has netted 9.9%, making it the best eight-day run since April, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) rose 0.5% after paring gains.


There were more economic tremors abroad.


Economic data showed that China's service sector expanded in August at its slowest pace in eight months. It was another worrying sign for the country's post-Covid recovery. And a eurozone survey showed output contracted at the fastest pace in nearly three years.


The Shanghai Composite lost 0.7% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng slid 2.1%. The STOXX Europe 600 Index fell 0.2%.


Stock Market Gets Distribution Day
----------------------------------


Volume on Wall Street rose from Friday. That was not a high bar to cross because Friday's trading was typically slow ahead of the three-day holiday weekend.


Still, the S&P's 0.4% drop left it with a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) — its first since the Aug. 29 [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) signal.


Breadth was poor, with decliners over advancers by 11-5 on the Nasdaq and by 7-2 on the NYSE.



Homebuilding and housing stocks tumbled, likely because of the jump in yields. IShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)) sold off 4.6%, and several leading homebuilders fell in heavy trading. Construction-related stocks such as **Hubbell** ([HUBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBB)), **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) and **TopBuild** ([BLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLD)) tumbled in heavy trading, too.


Five of the bottom eight industry groups were building-related. Homebuilders were the worst, down 4.8%.


A Not-So-Bad September?
-----------------------


Historical trends aren't on the stock market bulls' side. September is the worst month for stocks, and the week after Labor Day tends to be weak.


The Stock Trader's Almanac says September has been the worst month for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow since 1950, with an average drop of 0.5% in the S&P and 0.7% in the Dow and Nasdaq. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the S&P 500 averages a loss of 0.13% the week after the holiday.


This September may be different, though.


When the market is trending higher and up double-digits for the year, September historically hasn't been so bad, says Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.


When the S&P 500 enters the month above its 200-day moving average, the index's average monthly gains have been 0.2%. When the S&P is up at least 10% going into September, the average gain has been 0.6%. This year's market fits those conditions.

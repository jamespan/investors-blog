Trade War Fears Spark Losses, But Stock Market And Many Leading Stocks Fight Back

For much of this year, the stock market has acted as a gauge of the U.S.-China trade war. On Tuesday, the market lived up to that reputation as stocks sold off on a surprising setback.




President Trump said in London that a [trade deal with China may need to wait until after the 2020 U.S. election](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-fears-more-trump-tariffs-hit-dow-jones/). He didn't rule out a deal before then, but his remarks dashed hopes for at least a "phase one" accord by year-end. Also, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross warned that U.S. [tariffs on Chinese imports are set to take effect Dec. 15](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/wilbur-ross-says-china-trade-deal-after-2020-election-takes-away-leverage.html) unless a phase-one agreement is reached. He also told CNBC that no high-level talks are planned before that date. On Monday, the U.S. set tariffs on steel from Brazil and Argentina.


The stock market started rising in October, largely on expectations that U.S. and China negotiators were nearing terms on a preliminary trade accord. As investors have come to learn by now, the trade war can sneak up unexpectedly and can trigger quick stock losses.


But the market also has shown it can shake off such worries. By Tuesday's close, fears were subsiding. The Nasdaq, which plunged 1.5% early on, closed 0.6% lower. The S&P 500 reduced its loss to 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had more ground to make up and ended with a 1% loss.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP_5x5_120319-225x300.jpg)Positive reversals like Tuesday's indicate that buyers are still committed to the current market, and that should give investors some relief. It's possible that the market read Trump's comments as a negotiating ploy, seeking to avoid pressure to complete a deal before the election.


Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq. The combination of index declines in higher volume gave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). That's five in the past several weeks and two in as many days. (Granted, Monday's distribution day was cheap because volume obviously rose from Friday's half-day session.)


The Russell 2000 lost 0.3% and at one point Tuesday erased all gains from a bullish move to 52-week highs Nov. 25.


Stock Market Decline Not Entirely Surprising
--------------------------------------------


The way the stock market rallied since early October, it's not surprising for major stock indexes to pull back. This week's trade war worries may be nothing more than institutional investors locking in profits in what has been a great year for stocks. The S&P 500 is up 23.4% and the Nasdaq 28.4%.


Already, some sentiment indicators suggest the stock market will bounce soon. The [CBOE Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) rose more than 20% above its 10-day moving average, a level that often marks market lows. The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) topped 1.0 and ended at 0.92 — not quite enough for a bottoming signal.


Semiconductors — one of the industries most sensitive to trade problems — fell broadly. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, which tracks the Philadelphia semiconductor index, slid more than 1.5%. But the ETF found support at its 50-day moving average, another positive take-away.



[Apple also is vulnerable to a new round of tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-drops-investors-worry-about-looming-tariffs/) and its shares took a hit. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock made its sharpest decline below the 10-day moving average since its Sept. 11 breakout. Investors can use that to take profits on Apple shares.


Trade War Stocks Decline
------------------------


Other trade war-sensitive sectors such as retail and energy fell more than 1%. SPDR S&P Retail ETF ([XRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRT)) gapped down to a loss of 1.4% but also held above the 50-day moving average.


While there were a lot of losses to tally, leading stocks withstood the shaking relatively well. Many stocks pared gains, some impressively. **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)) plummeted 7% but found support at its 50-day line and ended the session a fraction higher.


**Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) slid back around their buy points but gallantly rebounded to close higher. In fact, many other top-rated software stocks reversed higher, making the industry a bright spot Tuesday.


Many other leading stocks fell, but few flashed sell signals. The IBD 50 kept itself pretty clean, falling a modest 0.3%, and it might have closed higher if not for wild-trading **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)). The stock sold off 10%. Sometimes a stock with great fundamentals and the shine of a new issue will tempt investors. But volatility can make it difficult if not impossible to hold.


In [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), **Inphi** ([INPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INPHI)) and **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) made round-trip sell signals on Monday.

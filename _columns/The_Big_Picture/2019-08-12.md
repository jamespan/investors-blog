  S&P 500, Nasdaq Lead Drop Of More Than 1% As This Key Resistance Level Emerges

Last week's stock market bounce is quickly dissipating, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shed more than 1% Monday in a broad retreat.




The S&P 500 fell 1.2%. With Monday's loss, resistance at the 50-day moving average suddenly is looking more formidable. That ceiling appeared last week, when a strong three-day rebound ran out of steam.


The Nasdaq composite and small-cap Russell 2000 also lost 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.5%, with medical essentials company **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) the only component up on the day, and barely so.


Just on Thursday, it looked like buyers were swarming back to the market. But after Monday's declines, indexes are below Thursday's lows. Sellers have the upper hand again: Declining stocks led advancers by a 2-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and by about 7-to-3 on the NYSE.

All S&P sectors fell; only defensive areas such as real estate and utilities basically held flat.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP081219-274x300.jpg)If there's some relief in the past two days of losses, it could be that they've occurred in lighter volume. Indeed, last week's three-day rally came in above-average volume, a sign that institutions haven't given up.


Two Reasons For A Potential Market Bottom
-----------------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain above their Aug. 5 lows, meaning that an attempted rally is still in effect. That gives the market a basis for a bottom, but so far there's been no [follow-through confirmation signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


One other reason favors the August lows: The [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) spiked above 1.15 at the same time. Many times in the past, elevated readings in this sentiment indicator have coincided with market bottoms. It most recently happened in the early-June market lows.


But this is no guarantee of a new uptrend. In October and November, when indexes went into a bear market, the put-call ratio spiked several times, but the market made only temporary dips.


Leaders Also Hit Stock Market
-----------------------------


There was no escape for leading stocks Monday. [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) tumbled 2.2%, the largest drop since the Aug. 5 sell-off. **Banco Macro** ([BMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMA)) certainly made things worse for the IBD 50. The stock plummeted nearly 53% as Argentine stocks were routed.


Political woes added to the list of trouble spots for the market, which was already burdened with [trade worries](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-got-dangerous-dow-jones-dives-as-yuan-breaks-key-level/) and [falling yields](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dow-jones-treasury-yields-yuan-slide-gold-price-spikes/).


In Hong Kong, demonstrations against Chinese rule continued, and protesters [forced the airport to cancel flights](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-12/government-urges-travelers-to-leave-airport-hong-kong-update?srnd=premium) until at least Tuesday morning. The Hang Seng index fell 0.4% and currently trades almost 15% below its 52-week peak of 30,280. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) fell more than 2%.


In Argentina, the stock market and the country's currency crashed after the ruling party's losses in primary elections were worse than expected. The lopsided vote against President Mauricio Macri means he is unlikely to be re-elected, and his [economic reforms face uncertainty](https://www.investors.com/news/argentina-stocks-mercadolibre-stock-plunge-argentina-president-macri/). Investors also fear a default of Argentine debt.


Crying For Argentina
--------------------


The GlobalX MSCI Argentina ETF ([ARGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARGT)) plummeted 24%, wiping out most gains for the year. The Merval index crashed about 37%. The peso sank to a record low vs. the U.S. dollar. **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) triggered a sell signal, which cost the e-commerce company its spot on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/).


[Airline stocks were one of the weakest](https://www.investors.com/news/airline-stocks-hong-kong-protests-argentina-elections/) industry groups, with several Latin American carriers down sharply. Airlines that serve Hong Kong also fell.


The Dow transports slid 1.7%, making transportation the day's worst-performing sector. Financials, retailers, and consumer discretionary sectors also were among the weakest.


Investor angst also is manifesting itself in the bond market, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell about 10 basis points to 1.64%. That's still around three-year lows. The [price of gold](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/gold-rush-how-high-can-gold-prices-go/) is holding around $1,500 an ounce, the highest since April 2013.


While investors are fleeing to havens in gold and bonds, remember that buying stocks is quite risky during a market correction. It's best to avoid buying stocks and to reduce exposure. Take some profits to reduce risk. Be sure to [sell any stock that falls 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) from your purchase price. A 3% or 4% drop may make sense to sell, too.

title: Why The Dow Jones Keeps Losing Ground Vs. The Nasdaq In The Stock Market

Years from now, you and your trading buddies might open up a bottle of wine and reminisce about the stock market in the year 2020. If you had just one word or two to describe this latest vintage on Wall Street, what would you use?




Coronavirus? Nasdaq? Software? Chips? Biotech? China? The Fed? Well, all of these will do just fine.


But let's not forget about that timeless element too: earnings.


Or, in the case of some companies housed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it's the lack of earnings. The Dow dropped 1.4% while the Nasdaq gained almost 0.6% and hit new all-time highs Thursday. Volume on the Nasdaq edged higher.


A shocking drop in fiscal third-quarter earnings by **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) — down 44% vs. a year ago, to 83 cents a share — certainly did not help the blue-chip cause. Neither did reports of big job cuts planned for the banking and airline industries.

No doubt, you need strong sales to qualify as a potential member of the market's [CAN SLIM leadership circle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Call it the mother of strong profit growth. Walgreens' sales finished flat vs. a year ago at $34.63 billion.


Walgreens shares gapped down and fell as much as 10%. They bounced off the day's low of 38.05 but still lost 7.8%. Sellers smothered the market as turnover spiked 325% above the stock's 50-day moving average.


That drop, plus declines of 2 points or more among 12 more Dow Jones components, handed the popular yet increasingly irrelevant industrial average a 1.4% drop Thursday.


As you can see on a daily chart at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) or on [Investors.com](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-dow-jones-indus-actual-0djia.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily), the Dow is in no man's land, technically, swimming a gradually tightening price channel created by its rising 50-day moving average and its flatlining 200-day line.

Thursday's overall action repeated a common refrain this year.


The Nasdaq once again enjoyed strength in tech, medical and internet companies with either blistering profit growth, eye-popping sales increases, or both. A surge off its session low on Thursday is just what you desire in a confirmed uptrend.


Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), the ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100, did even better. It and Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) both rose 0.8%, vs. a 0.6% slide by the S&P 500. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund fell 2% and tickled its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 14. The NYSE financial index backtracked 1.8%.


So Few Of These Top Stocks 'Make' The Dow Jones
-----------------------------------------------


If you focus on the companies that get spotlighted on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) or on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders), then you actually may come away with a different view of how the economy is doing and evolving. Many of them show up in the Market Pulse table.


[Other key stock lists at Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) offer a treasure trove of companies, both younger and older, that show truly amazing increases in the top and bottom lines.


Fear edged up, at least among options players. The [Cboe Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) rallied nearly 4% to 29.17; it lies 65% beneath this year's peak of 85.47.


One Negative In The Stock Market Today
--------------------------------------


One concern about Thursday stems from the stock market internals.


Despite the Nasdaq's rally, losing stocks swamped winners by more than a 2-1 ratio. You generally want to see the major equity averages rise and positive breadth expand. That said, the Nasdaq's advance-decline line has rebounded bullishly from its year-to-date low marked on March 18.


On the NYSE, decliners beat gainers by nearly 3 to 1.


If fewer stocks rise even as the Nasdaq scales new peaks, call that a curious and bearish divergence. The Nifty 50 during the 1970s did not end well. Remember the dot-com bubble of 2000? History, as Mark Twain says, does not repeat itself but it sure does rhyme.

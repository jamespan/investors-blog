Stock Market Reverses Higher Ahead Of Thanksgiving As Nasdaq Leads
===================================================================

The stock market delivered an early surprise to investors Wednesday, reversing higher ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.




After gapping down at the open, the major indexes chipped away at their losses throughout the session. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed firmly in positive territory. The Dow industrials ended effectively flat. That's a big improvement from Monday's action, when the market sold off into the close.


Early Wednesday, the Labor Department said weekly jobless claims fell to 199,000. That marked the lowest level since 1969. It also came in well below Econoday estimates for 264,000 claims and the prior week's 268,000 filings.


Around 2 p.m. ET, minutes from the Federal Reserve's November meeting showed Fed officials seem increasingly poised to adjust asset purchases and rate policy — as needed.


"The Committee should be prepared to adjust the pace of asset purchases and raise the target range for the federal funds rate sooner than participants currently anticipated if inflation continued to run higher than levels consistent with the Committee's objectives," according to the minutes.

After a brief pullback, stocks quickly rallied back to close near session highs.


The Nasdaq led with a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher. And while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just short of a positive finish, its upside reversal from a 223-point deficit was bullish.


Energy Up, Retail Down
----------------------


Real estate, energy and consumer discretionary were the biggest gainers among the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Materials and consumer staples led the downside.


Two oil stocks joined [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) Wednesday, as energy continues to outperform. Canada-based explorer **Ovintiv** ([OVV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVV)) joined Leaderboard as a half position, as it cleared a narrow trend line near 37.


**Magnolia Oil & Gas** ([MGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGY)) was added to the [Leaders Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist) as the Houston-based explorer tries for a rebound off its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


U.S. and international oil and gas explorers rank in the top 10 among [IBD's 197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-nov-23-2021/). Coal, solar and alternative energy also make the top 10.


Earnings Movers Today
---------------------


Several stocks saw sharp moves after earnings reports.


**Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) gapped up and rose 5% in heavy trade after its [fiscal Q4 results](https://www.investors.com/news/deere-earnings-beat-despite-strike-de-stock-nears-buy-point/) topped views. The stock cleared an early alternate entry of 366.30. The buy range goes up to 384.62. The standard [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) for the current consolidation is 393.10, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.


**HP Inc.** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) soared 10% to gap up past a 32.38 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), while **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) surged 13%. Both stocks are now extended.


The downside was just as extreme. **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) gapped down and sank 15% in huge volume to an eight-month low. Late Tuesday, the design software maker's Q3 results topped views, but its current-quarter outlook fell short of estimates.


**Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) plunged 29% after the department store's Q3 earnings missed views. Cowen lowered its price target to 27 from 35, [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nordstrom-jwn-stock-sinks-earnings-analysts-51637750213) reported, saying Nordstrom could face challenges in winning back shoppers.


**Gap** ([GPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPS)) dived 24% after the apparel retailer reported weak Q3 results and cut its full-year guidance due to significant supply-chain constraints.


What To Do Now
--------------


For now, the stock market still looks healthy.


Despite Monday's beating, the Nasdaq found support near its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and continues to trade well above its rising 50-day moving average, though an upside test of the 16,000 level still lies ahead. The distribution day count remains low, which indicates the big money is staying put.


Software leaders like **Asana** ([ASNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASNA)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) flashed a warning as they tumbled below their 50-day lines. Yet, top chip stocks such as **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) keep marching toward record highs.


The Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers shows bulls outpacing bears by a 56.6%-21.7% ratio. Bulls have held above 55% the last three weeks, which indicates a higher level of risk. But that's still below the 60%-70% danger zone.


You can find the bulls vs. bears ratio, as well as other contrarian sentiment indicators, on the [Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) page.


Still, with the increased volatility this week, it's important to adhere to sell rules — on both the upside and downside. Lock in some gains when a stock reaches the [20%-25% profit-taking goal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/). And be ready to sell if a stock triggers a sell rule, such as a high-volume [breach of the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) or by [falling 7%-8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) below the buy point.

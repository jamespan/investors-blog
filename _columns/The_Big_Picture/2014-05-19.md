Stocks shook off morning weakness and finished higher for a second straight session Monday.

  

Gains in telecom, software and Internet industry groups helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq rally 0.9%. It's now closer to a potential resistance level at its 50-day moving average, which has sloped downward.

  

The S&P 500 rose a milder 0.4%. Losses in utility stocks weighed on the benchmark index. Since the Dow Jones utility average topped April 30, the S&P 500 has inched slightly higher. Retail groups were also weak Monday.

  

Both major indexes closed nearly at their session highs.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 made it two gains in a row, climbing 1%. It closed slightly below its 50-day line. The IBD 50 outpaced those indexes with a 1.2% gain.

  

Winners topped losers by more than two to one on the Nasdaq and a little less than two to one on the NYSE. But volume was lower on both major exchanges for a second straight session. Trade was particularly soft on the NYSE.

  

While the lower trade was disappointing, Monday's action still marked another day of progress, following Friday's bullish reversal.

  

Overall, choppy action continues to dictate the market. Since the Nasdaq's big bounce off its 200-day line April 15, the index has been stuck between 4177 and 4014 as well as its 50-day and 200-day lines. While the S&P 500 hit a new record high last week, there was little to celebrate, and the index quickly pulled back. Both major indexes have yet to make a decisive break either way.

  

While this type of market will test the patience of many investors, don't take your eyes completely off of it. You should still watch the day-to-day action of the major indexes and scout for leading stocks to put on your watch list. From the IBD 50, Weekly Review, New America, Stock Spotlight and other columns, there are plenty of places to get ideas for your watch list.

  

Do the work now. Get to know the stories behind the stocks, and have your entry points ready. Be prepared, and you won't have to scramble later when the market improves.

  

Despite tough market conditions, more and more stocks are clearing buy points. But results have been spotty.

  

**Arris Group** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)) passed a 30.47 entry from a cup-with-handle base. But volume wasn't impressive. It also closed below the buy point. Arris has had trouble with the 30 level in the past.

  

Thinly traded **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) showed much better price-and-volume action as it cleared a 64.32 buy point in a flat base. Cal-Maine is one of the top stocks in the Food-Meat Products group, which ranked No. 4 in Monday's IBD. New issue **Phibro Animal Health** ([PAHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAHC)) cleared an 18.60 buy point from an IPO base.

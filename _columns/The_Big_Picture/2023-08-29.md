  Stock Market Powers Higher On JOLTS Data, Unlocks This Key Shift

The stock market ended Tuesday in an exuberant mood, surging on weaker-than-expected labor-market data. But investors should be on their guard as more key economic data lies ahead.




The Nasdaq composite impressed most out of the major stock market indexes as it shot up 1.7%. This means it has now risen nearly 3% for the week so far. More importantly, the tech-heavy index rallied back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Now it just needs to make the move above the key technical benchmark stick.


The S&P 500 also powered higher, vaulting 1.5% and clearing its own 50-day line. The benchmark index is up more than 17% for the year as stocks look to regain recently ceded territory.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the weakest major index, though it still climbed 0.9% and is now above its short-term and major moving averages. **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were the biggest gainers on the blue chip index.


Small caps also made an impressive upward thrust, with the Russell 2000 lifting 1.4%. But it was growth stocks that gave the bears the most painful beating, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) soaring 2.3%.


Job Openings Data JOLTS Stock Market Outlook
--------------------------------------------


The release of the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics early Tuesday bolstered the market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MP082923-300x300.jpg)Job listings [dropped to 8.8 million](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/key-federal-reserve-inflation-rate-jobs-and-jolts-data-to-test-sp-500-rally/) in July, much lower than the forecast for 9.5 million. June's openings were also revised downward to 9.165 million. Â Openings are now back at levels last seen in the summer of 2021.


Treasury yields closed notably lower. The 10-year yield dived 9 basis points to 4.12%, while the two-year yield tumbled 12 basis points to 4.89%. The yield curve narrowed but remained inverted.


The odds for a quarter-point hike or more in November have now fallen to less than 50%, according to CME FedWatch.


"From the Fed's perspective, the week is off to a promising start with the JOLTS job opening report much softer than expected, alongside downward revisions to the previous month," Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said in a note to clients. "The Fed needs to see a softer labor market to be confident that price pressures aren't just abating but substantially and sustainably, and this report is a move in the right direction."


The positive reaction on the indexes means the IBD market outlook has now switched from "correction" to "confirmed uptrend." We are recommending an exposure range of 20%-40%, up from 0%-20%. But investors should increase their holdings at a measured pace.


There is still plenty of key economic data to drop this week though, including the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index numbers on Thursday and the U.S. nonfarm payroll numbers on Friday.

Tesla Stock Boosts This Stock Market Group
------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors all finished in positive territory, with communication services, consumer discretionary and technology the top performers. The defensive utilities group and the energy sector made the smallest gains.


Once again, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gives a deeper look into the performance of the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Educational software, consumer electronics retailers and database software plays were among the top groups Tuesday. Automakers also had a strong session, with a monster 7.7% gain for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) a key catalyst there.


Conversely, heavy duty truck parts stocks, food wholesalers and mail order plays all lagged.

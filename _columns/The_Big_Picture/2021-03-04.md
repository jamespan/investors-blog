The stock market ended sharply lower Thursday following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments, as the 10-year Treasury yield spiked. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite sold off for a third straight session, as top growth stocks tumbled again.




The Nasdaq declined as much as 3.4% before paring losses to 2.1%. The S&P 500 declined 1.3%, while the Dow Jones industrials slid 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 tumbled 2.8%.


Leading growth stocks crumbled, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded down 5.2% Thursday and slid below its 50-day moving average. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) resiliently climbed more than 1% and remains extended from a 1,843.93 buy point in a flat base.


Volume rose sharply on the Nasdaq and the NYSE compared with Wednesday's figures.


Stock Market Sell-Off
---------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP030421-259x300.jpg)The stock market began its precipitous descent midday Thursday after the [Fed's Powell](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chief-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-twist-yields-surge-sp500/) said last week's surge in bond yields "caught my attention." But Powell also said that the Fed remains highly accommodative and didn't hint at a new "twist" in policy. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked, closing at 1.55%.


The Nasdaq dived below last week's lows, closing at its lowest level since Jan. 4 and turning negative for the year. The tech-heavy composite is down 1.3% in 2021 after rallying as much as 10% from Jan. 1 to its Feb. 16 record high.


For the S&P 500, support at the 50-day line finally gave way, while the Dow 30 is right at its own 50-day support level.


One week after [IBD's market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) was [downgraded to "uptrend under pressure,"](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-routed-nasdaq-pierces-key-level-why-investors-must-change-trading-strategy/) the stock market outlook was downgraded to "market in correction" Thursday amid sharp weakness in the major stock indexes and leading growth stocks.


With the outlook in a correction, the Market Pulse will no longer show the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the indexes.

Stock Market Correction: What To Do Now
---------------------------------------


During stock market corrections, investors should be lightly invested — or even 100% cash — until a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). Follow-throughs signal a new potential market uptrend and give the green light to start buying stocks again.


Use the downtime as a chance to take a mental break; however, don't tune out. Be on watch for the next leaders to emerge. One of the best ways to identify the next cycle of leading stocks during stock market corrections is to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-rally-track-relative-strength-correction-alibaba-new-buy-point/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.



Top Stocks Trigger Sell Signals
-------------------------------


On Thursday, a number of high-quality stocks triggered sell signals, emphasizing the danger in the new stock market correction.


**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) sold off 5.8% Thursday despite [announcing a deal](https://www.investors.com/news/draftkings-taps-into-one-of-the-fastest-growing-sports-in-massive-deal/) with the UFC. [DKNG stock](https://www.investors.com/research/draftkings-dkng-stock-buy-now/) briefly [fell more than 7%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) below a 64.88 alternative entry, but it is still holding above a 56.87 cup-with-handle buy point.


The online betting specialist will offer in-game promotions, activations, in-broadcast odds integrations and UFC branding across its daily fantasy and betting products. DraftKings will also become the presenting partner of the UFC's countdown clock. The [five-year deal is worth $350 million](https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/31002136/ufc-partnering-draftkings-massive-5-year-deal), according to ESPN.


**PayPal** ticker symb=PYPL] tumbled 6.3%, diving through its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. Meanwhile, **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) descended nearly 6% to break down through its own 50-day line. A [sharp break below the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) can signal the end of a big run.

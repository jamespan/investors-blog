Stock Market Bears Still Hibernate As This Asset Outperforms Equities
======================================================================

Earlier this year, when it appeared as if stocks were going into free fall, the bears licked their chops. Some talking heads pounded the table for gold.




Yes in fact, gold has been going up — the "black gold" variety, that is.


Crude oil has emerged as the asset class of the year. West Texas Intermediate near-term futures padded year-to-date gains with a more than 3% rally and hit as high as $71.36 a barrel on Wednesday. Yet for now, the sterling rise (metaphorically speaking) in the global commodity is not hampering the slow rise in the greater stock market.


The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 rose almost in lock step throughout the session and ended up 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.7%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP050918-201x300.jpg)Small caps stayed in the back of the bus. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both coasted roughly 0.6% higher.


Better Than The Small Caps
--------------------------


At 1596, the Russell 2000 is now up almost 4% year to date. Not too shabby, considering that the popular index rallied 13.1% in 2017.


The Nasdaq, on the other hand, is now up 6.3% since Jan. 1. The tech-heavy index continues to reflect strong demand for [FAANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) and other large-cap techs.


But in 2018, oil has really stolen the show. According to Bloomberg data, WTI near-term futures have surged 18% so far this year. Oil is also up an astounding 67% from its trailing 12-month low of around $42.53.


Gold futures on the Comex are trading near $1,312 an ounce, up 0.2% for the year.


Institutional Investors Buy Big
-------------------------------


Volume bulged 5% to 10% higher on both main stock exchanges. What's more, the Nasdaq staged a significant advance in above-average turnover for the first time in more than five weeks. (*The volume bars in the big daily charts of the General Market Indicators page show the 50-day moving average. See the Nasdaq and S&P 500 daily charts via the link at the end of this article.*)


Seasoned IBD readers know that such action is a plus. A solid gain by the major indexes in heavier turnover points to serious accumulation by mutual funds, big investment managers, banks, insurers and the like. And such a price-volume combination is absolutely vital in a time when both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have chalked up a medium-sized number of distribution days.


Even the lagging Dow Jones industrial average, up for a fifth day in a row, notched three of those daily gains in heavier than usual trading volume. The Dow's chart in the General Market Indicators page notes that just seven of the 30 Dow industrial components hold a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- or higher. They include **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)).


In terms of that market yardstick, clearly, there's room for improvement.


Distribution refers to a drop of at least 0.2% by the major averages in higher trade vs. the prior session. IBD's market research has found that it can take just four or five distribution days within a span of three to four weeks to destroy a bull run.


That's not looking to be the case for now.


A Bullish Change
----------------


One reason? Again, please check out the S&P 500's big daily chart via the PDF link at the bottom of this article. The large-cap gauge hopped back above its rising 50-day moving average Wednesday. Technically, that's good. In a healthy bull market, the key indexes lead their respective 50-day lines, not lag them.


In this respect, the S&P 500 is now aligned with the Nasdaq and the S&P 600. At 980, the S&P 600 has posted a new all-time closing high.


Will this bullish action by the S&P 500 last? It hasn't lately. On April 17, the index rallied back above the 50-day line, but tripped beneath it just two sessions later. From a longer-term perspective, the key index has pretty much been trapped within a roughly 200-point range, from 2600 to 2800.


What's causing such rangebound action amid an American economy that is now running at below-4% unemployment and still has relatively low interest rates?


Who's Hot Now?
--------------


Worry over how fast the Federal Reserve will keep raising the cost money is clearly one factor. The possibility of raging inflation is still a front-burner issue, even if last week's economic data showed a smaller than expected increase in American workers' real wages.


Sector rotation may be another. On Wednesday, no fewer than 17 of IBD's 197 industry groups rallied 2% or more. The motley crew of outperformers ranged from gaming software and internet content to hospitals and dairy products. IBD's two oil exploration and production industry groups (U.S. and international) also throttled up 2% or more.


On a year-to-date basis, oil stocks are improving. The two E&P groups, plus the oil machinery and equipment group have each gained 10% since Jan. 1. Oilfield services firms are up 9.3% as a group.


The Energy sector now ranks No. 4 among IBD's 33 sectors (see them in the [stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-may-08-2018/)) in terms of mid- to long-term performance.


But a bull market cannot survive on the energy sector alone.


Who's doing better on a year-to-date basis than oil and gas? Think desktop software, security software, internet-based retail, enterprise software, movies, travel booking, specialty software, and database software. All of these industry groups and more are up at least 20% since Jan. 1.

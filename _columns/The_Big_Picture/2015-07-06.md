Stocks ended off their session lows after sliding in the aftermath of a vote in Greece to reject more austerity measures. Some leaders suffered big losses. The S&P 500 lost 0.4% after being down as much as 0.9% at the start of trading. Energy stocks were an area of weakness for the benchmark index, as crude oil plunged nearly 8%.

  

The Nasdaq trimmed a 1% loss to 0.3% but closed back below the 5000 mark. Solar, chipmaker and data-storage stocks were weak, but biotechs were a pocket of strength.

  

Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 held above last week's low, which was a positive.

  

The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.3%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 eased just 0.1%.

  

News Sunday that Greek voters rejected more austerity measures hit global stock markets Monday, bringing more uncertainty. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/070615-760302-european-central-bank-pressures-greek-banks.htm?ntt=european+central+bank+tightens+screws+on+greek+banks).) France's CAC 40 shed 2%, while Germany's DAX dropped 1.5%.

  

Volume jumped on both major exchanges from Thursday's preholiday pace. The higher turnover and index losses gave the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 an additional distribution day. But at the same time, the May 29 distribution day on both major indexes fell off due to time.

  

Leaders have weakened in the past two weeks and more were hit Monday, especially Chinese names.

  

**Jumei International** ([JMEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JMEI)) and **500.com** ([WBAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBAI)) slumped 8% and 10%, respectively. **Noah Hold-ings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)) shed 8%. It has wiped out a 48% gain past a 25.70 buy point, marking a sell signal.

  

On Saturday, China rolled out new measures to help its plunging stock market. The Shanghai composite has dived 30% from its June high.

  

Elsewhere, **Santander Consumer USA** ([SC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SC)) slumped 8% following news late Thursday that its CEO was stepping down. It has nearly wiped out a 13% gain past a 23.72 buy point.

  

On Monday, the IBD 50 fell 0.5%, or a little more than the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

  

The overall environment remains a challenge for investors.

  

However, a couple of contrarian indicators point to at least a short-term low.

  

The put-call volume ratio again finished above 1.0, which is bullish. Also, the NYSE short interest is heading toward a five-year high (see Page B11), but it still has a little further to go.

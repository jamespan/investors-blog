  Nasdaq Marks This Bullish Shift After Fed Chief Powell's Decision To Leave Rates Unchanged

Judging by the stock market's behavior in the last 90 minutes of the session, investors seemed to breathe a serious sigh of relief on the Federal Reserve's decision to make yet another pause in its inflation-fighting campaign. Wednesday's rally also reflected a common refrain of 2023: The Nasdaq has been leading the way, and it may just do so again.




Gains by the Nasdaq composite were decent but not beefy after the "no news" announcement by the Fed to keep the overnight lending rate to banks at a 5.25%-5.5% target range. After [Fed Chair Jerome Powell began speaking to the news media](https://www.investors.com/news/the-fed-just-did-nothing-that-may-hurt-the-sp-500-but-stocks-are-up-now/) at 2:30 p.m. ET, the leading index this year hovered in a relatively tight trading range, between 12,900 and 12,960, up around 0.4% to 0.9%.


All Eyes, Ears On Powell
------------------------


The news conference perhaps went longer than many investors had anticipated. Powell answered a wheelbarrow's load of questions on a range of topics, including the economy, monetary policy, inflation, the possibility of a recession, and even a recent face-to-face meeting with small-business owners. But eventually Wall Street appeared to get this clear message:


The U.S. central bank feels it's done a good enough job to raise interest rates to a level that is leading to a beneficial cooling in prices and growth. Now, let's see if the next two months' worth of data affirms that the Fed is in fact doing its job of getting a firm control over the long-term rate of inflation.


Put simply, Powell & Co. have gotten less hawkish. He is not necessarily more dovish. Inflation is still obviously a problem.


Also, the Fed's statement again made it crystal-clear that the Fed wants to stick with 2% inflation over the long haul. But progress is being made. So the Fed's rate-setting committee agreed unanimously that it can now buy some time to wait and watch.


Nasdaq Leads
------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MP110223-205x300.jpg)Wednesday was one of those rare days over the past two years in which investors bought both stocks and bonds.


As the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.78%, just above its session low, the U.S. equity market finished practically at session highs.


The Nasdaq led the way. The composite's 1.6% gain to 13,061 stood well above a 1.1% rise for the S&P 500 and a 0.7% advance for the laggard Dow Jones Industrial Average.


High-yield corporate bonds also rallied.


The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ([HYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HYG)) exchange traded fund gained just 0.4%. But it also marked a nifty reversal from an early 0.4% slide, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). HYG also rose for the seventh time in nine sessions.


Other data sources noted that HYG rallied 0.9%.


Meanwhile, the ProShares UltraShort 20 Year Plus ETF ([TBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TBT)), a way to bet on rising interest rates in long-dated Treasury bonds, slumped almost 4% in heavy volume.


TBT is levered to move twice the inverse performance of a 20-year-plus U.S. Treasury index managed by Barclays. The fund has now fallen at least 2% or more eight times since the start of the fourth quarter.


Watch to see if the ETF also breaks below the key short-termÂ  [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), or finds support.


[Friday's October U.S. payrolls report](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) may influence the next big move.


Going back to the Dow Jones industrials, if the Dow did not have a decent sprinkling of megacap techs, perhaps its gain would have been even smaller. Among the 30 components, at least seven rose 3 points or more. And only **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) and **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) hail from outside the technology or biotech fields.


Volume grew 5% vs. the prior session to 4.55 billion shares on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE turnover shrank 0.7% to 4.22 billion shares.


Activity Picks Up On The Nasdaq
-------------------------------


Why is the volume data critical?



For the Nasdaq, its strong gain Wednesday in higher volume came on the fourth day of a rally attempt.


Based on decades of market research, IBD has found that Wednesday's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) could indicate that at the minimum, a tradable rally is now underway.


Ultimately, as highlighted often by panelists on IBD's daily show on investing, ["IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/)," a follow-through day is only as good as the quality and quantity of leading growth stocks that help lead the way to excellent upward moves.


The Nasdaq's follow-through day on Wednesday also spurred a decision to raise the suggested level of portfolio exposure in stocks to a 20%-40% bandwidth, up from 0%-20%.


IBD made a downgrade to the mostly cash level on Oct. 13, while the IBD outlook remained at "uptrend under pressure." Five trading days later, on Oct. 20, IBD shifted the outlook back to an ultradefensive stance at "market in correction."


It's easy to dismiss this newest rally attempt. After all, following a bullish first half of 2023, the stock market and the Nasdaq has seen a number of new follow-through days fail to yield substantial gains. It's a great time, for instance, to study a daily chart of the S&P 500 after its Day 7 follow-through on Aug. 29.


Think Like A Contrarian Trader
------------------------------



Of course, the market tends to reveal a "it's darkest near dawn" environment at the start of a new confirmed uptrend.


[New highs among stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/)? Abysmally low. The technical health of most major equity indexes? Darn near atrocious.


Just take a gander at the Russell 2000, one of the worst-performing indexes all year.



The small-cap gauge rose nearly 0.5%. The Russell is miles beneath its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/), currently at 1834. The 50-day line? Poised to nose-dive for a seventh straight week.

More Gloom Is Good
------------------


Yet gloomy conditions tend to be the best type for a budding new rally to really take hold.


The latest [Investors Intelligence survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) of newsletter editors shows the bullish ratio plunging back below 50% at 42.9%. That's good. Growing pessimism among the pundits implies that they're raising more cash and sitting on the sidelines. If the market gains more momentum, these market participants may become future buyers.


The stock market still harbors a lot of uncertainty regarding earnings and the future economy. Yet the headlines also proved quite bleak back in October of 1998, October of 2002, March of 2009, and March of 2020. So, now is as good a time as ever to aggressively screen for stocks, both on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, that show immense relative strength.

What To Do Now
--------------


Sharpen your eye for stocks that simply haven't fallen much in the past two months. Have they moved sideways, held above their key moving averages, or built a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/)? If so, you just uncovered excellent clues into what the savviest and biggest institutional investors are accumulating.


IBD Sector Leaders, the IBD 50 and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) illustrate dozens of high-quality growth companies with high relative strength. [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and SwingTrader added new ideas on Wednesday.


You might notice that the lion's share of stocks in these growth-stock lists come from tech, retail and consumer spending, health care, insurance and oil and gas.


Wall Street's Take On Fed Meeting
---------------------------------


Louis Navellier, veteran fund manager and expert in growth stocks, wrote in a comment emailed to IBD that not only did the Federal Reserve admit that inflation is finally slowing down, but it "also acknowledged that the run-up in long-term rates is now weighing on economic activity, which means we're decelerating pretty fast."


One example of this conclusion?


Navellier points to the ISM manufacturing survey, which hit the wires at 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The index fell sharply below the neutral 50 level to 46.7, [below every single economist's forecast tracked by Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). It marked a sharp deceleration from 49 in September. Of course, the UAW strikes likely made an impact. Still, Navellier did not mince words.


"Our manufacturing sector has been down for 12 straight months now. There is no onshoring or economic manufacturing resurgence in America. Factories are being build, but there's nothing going on in them yet," he wrote. Navellier added that he thinks the U.S. central bank will lower the fed funds rate in early 2024 because "the Fed hates being in the spotlight and wants to avoid the political debate in America."


What The Buy Side Sees For Rates And Stocks
-------------------------------------------


Here is a sampling of additional comments by investing pros on the Fed news:


"We expect the Fed to be done with its rate-rising cycle. This paves the way for the yield curve to continue to normalize and move towards an upward slope, especially from 2-year Treasury (bond) maturities on out. Good time to extend duration." -- Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager, Sit Invest


"This is the eye of the needle that the Fed is trying to thread: reduce consumer and aggregate demand but not so much as to cause a recession that leads to painfully high unemployment. They need all the luck in the world." -- Lon Erickson, portfolio manager, Thornburg Investment Management


"The U.S. economy remains resilient, with strong consumption and high job openings, which justifies a pause. Leading economic indicators (LEI) have been declining, but the six-month change in LEI has not signaled a recession as of September, suggesting a controlled decrease in inflation with minimal economic weakness. This scenario may result in structurally higher interest rates compared with the historically low rates of the past decade." -- Damanick Dantes, portfolio strategist for global markets, Global X


"The Fed knows that both floating rate debt and all types of re-financings will amplify pain as we progress forward. Given that, it can let the debt markets do the last of the pain infliction for them. The rise in real yields has helped to push the curve steeper, and the 5-year/10-year (part of the yield curve) has now joined the 10-year/30-year with a positive upward sloping curve. Only the 2-year/5-year spread remains inverted. This overall look does suggest the bond market is positioning for a turn in market rates ahead. The big move will come when the 2-year bond starts to anticipate cuts." -- James Knightley, chief international economist, ING

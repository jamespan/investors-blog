Stock indexes took different paths Tuesday. The Nasdaq and small caps headed sharply south, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gripped small gains. After hours, Apple stock surprised the Street with better-than-expected results.




The blue-chip Dow Jones and large-cap S&P 500 each added about 0.1%. However, those slender gains looked pretty good compared to the Nasdaq's 0.8% loss and the small-cap Russell 2000's 0.5% dent.


Volume was up on both major exchanges, slapping the Nasdaq with a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


A distribution day involves a loss in rising volume. Such action suggests institutional selling.

Five Stocks To Blame
--------------------


Five stocks shoulder a good part of the blame. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) class A and **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) class C together make up 11.6% of the Nasdaq's weighting. The two each plunged 8% in fast trade.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock, which comprises 6.7% of the Nasdaq, slid 1.8%.


Two other top weightings didn't fall as much but still scraped a little deeper. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which is 6.4% of the Nasdaq, and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), 3.5% of the weighting, fell 0.8% and 1%, respectively.


In total, the five stocks comprise about 28% of the Nasdaq's weighting.


The five effectively dug a hole for the Nasdaq, and there were no dramatic weightings on the upside to compensate.


Meanwhile, in the Dow Jones, three stocks lost 1% or more, but four gained 2% or more. This effectively protected the Dow.


Chips Advance
-------------


Things could've been worse for the Nasdaq if not for the chip stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.8%. Chip equipment maker **Brooks Automation** ([BRKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKS)) knifed 16% higher. Chip designer **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) gapped up 8%. Both rallied on earnings.


Another chip designer,Â **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), rose about 3% as it bounced off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


After hours, [Apple reported quarterly results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q2-2019-apple-stock/). The company beat views on the top and bottom lines. Apple stock rose about 5% in after-hours trade.


Infrastructure Stocks
---------------------


In the meantime, the Democrats and President Trump appeared to have reached [a deal on infrastructure spending](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-dems-eye-two-trillion-infrastructure-deal-martin-marietta-stock-buy-point/).


Cement stocks rose in reaction. **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) popped 3.6%. **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) rose 3%. **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) gapped up 2.5%. **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) added 1%.


Playing politically favored stocks is more risky than concentrating on the earnings of elite stocks, which the cement stocks aren't. For instance, Martin Marietta grew earnings only 7% last year. Earnings sagged 34% for U.S. Concrete. Eagle Materials' earnings fell 4%. Vulcan Materials rose 34%, but the Street expects only an 18% gain this year.


Vulcan and Martin Marietta are in the 5% buy zone after recently clearing entries.


The Federal Reserve met Tuesday and will conclude its talks Wednesday. Analysts are expecting interest rates to remain at the current range of 2.25% to 2.50%.


Notes From The Stock Chart
--------------------------


The Nasdaq's 50-day line crossed above its 200-day line in early April and has held that constructive positioning. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones have done the same. But the 50-day line is still below the 200-day line on the small-cap Russell 2000, which has lagged the main indexes.


The two major indexes still appear to be undergoing a test at roughly 8133 and 2940 for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, respectively.


Apple will be a key stock to watch Wednesday. Bulls are hoping that gains after hours will carry over into the regular session.

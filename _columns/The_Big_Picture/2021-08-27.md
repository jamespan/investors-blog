The Nasdaq and S&P 500 advanced to record highs Friday in the wake of Fed chief Jerome Powell's speech. The major stock indexes snapped back from Thursday's moderate losses. During Friday's bullish action, top growth stocks **Airbnb** ([ABNB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABNB)) and **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) rose to new buy points.




Just after the stock market open Friday, [Powell](https://www.investors.com/news/federal-reserve-chief-powell-leans-toward-tapering-asset-purchases-this-year-sandp-500/) said that he was among the majority of policy committee members at the July meeting inclined to start tapering asset purchases this year. That suggests a strong chance the Fed will announce the forthcoming policy change at its Sept. 21-22 meeting.


A September announcement that tapering will begin in December would seem to fit the Fed's guidance for plenty of advance notice of its policy shift. Powell also stressed that tapering would be done gradually and gave a benign outlook on inflation.


Today's Stock Market Action
---------------------------


On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed more than 1.2%, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.9%. Both indexes hit new highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.7% and remains just off new highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 outpaced the other indexes, jumping nearly 2.9% and decisively clearing its 50-day moving average.


![MP082721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MP082721-249x300.jpg)The stock market's action reaffirmed the current uptrend and was in stark contrast to Thursday's moderate losses. The buying Friday was broad-based, though two sectors did edge lower — SPDR Health Care ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) (down 0.2%) and SPDR Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) (down less than 0.1%). Winners led losers by 5-to-1 on the NYSE and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Leading growth stocks showed strong gains, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 2.8%. [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) advanced 2.6%, moving further past a 208.85 buy point in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). Shares are now about 9% above that entry.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and appeared to be higher on the NYSE compared with Thursday's numbers.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Airbnb, Palantir Technologies
------------------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/leaderboard-10-year/) stock Airbnb is back above its buy point after falling beneath it in a sharp move Thursday. Leaderboard's analysis noted the stock's breakout Wednesday came with conviction and strong volume, a positive sign.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), [ABNB stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-airbnb-inc-cl-a-abnb.aspx) shows a modest 29 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/). Newer issues rarely have a sustained earnings track record — which is a key component of the Composite Rating — so a weak rating is normal.


[Palantir Technologies](https://www.investors.com/research/palantir-pltr-stock-buy-now/) is trying to break out past a [cup-with-handle's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) 26.04 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Shares rallied 3.4% Friday, ending just below the entry. The stock's relative strength line remains far from its old highs. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day.


On Aug. 12, Palantir reported [second-quarter adjusted earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-earnings-due-amid-growing-spac-investments/) that met expectations, while revenue growth came in above Wall Street targets. Palantir featured in this week's [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-nvidia-stock-is-breaking-out-today/) column.

The Nasdaq led the stock market lower Thursday as first-quarter earnings reports continue to roll out, with **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) plunging nearly 10% on [weaker-than-expected profit margins and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-down-11-in-april-analyst-says-earnings-expectations-at-a-crossroads/). Tesla shares closed at their lowest level since Jan. 26.




The market uptrend now finds a number of leading stocks near buy points, including **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and [IBD Leaderboard Watchlist stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)).


Economic data pointed to slowing activity.


First-time jobless claims rose more than expected, to 245,000 vs. 240,000 in the previous week. They were expected to rise to 242,000. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's April manufacturing index fell to -31.3, below expectations for a -23.2 reading in April.


Further, existing-home sales from the National Association of Realtors dropped to 4.44 million in March, below estimates that called for an ease to 4.5 million, vs. 4.58 million in February.


Earnings Movers
---------------


Other key earnings movers Thursday include **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)).


Dow Jones stocks American Express and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) [also reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibm-stock-climbs-on-first-quarter-earnings-report/), with mixed reactions. American Express shares cut losses to 1%, while IBM gave up nearly all of its big gains.


[AT&T shares](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/t-stock-att-earnings-news-q12023/)[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MP042023--229x300.jpg)](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/t-stock-att-earnings-news-q12023/) tumbled 10.4% to fall sharply through the 50-day line, while [DHI stock](https://www.investors.com/news/dr-horton-earnings-plunge-dhi-stock-in-buy-zone/) jumped 5.6% after easily beating earnings and revenue estimates for the second quarter, while giving upbeat revenue guidance for the full year. DHI stock moved out of buy range beyond a 99.09 buy point.


[LRCX stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lrcx-stock-lam-research-disappoints-with-outlook/) advanced more than 7%, bullishly retaking the 50-day line and closing near an early entry at 533.19. [Las Vegas Sands](https://www.investors.com/news/lvs-stock-earnings-breakout-as-macau-booms-again/) jumped 3.7% to break out past a 60.40 buy point in cup with handle. Finally, [TSM stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-sees-more-weakness-ahead/) rose 2.4%, still consolidating below its 50-day line.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3%, extending a losing streak to three sessions. The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined 0.8%.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE vs. the prior session. That gave the S&P 500 its first distribution day of the current uptrend. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) count remained at three.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 0.6%, falling a for a second straight session. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), homebuilders **Meritage Homes** ([MTH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTH)) and **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) were among the winners on the day, with gains of 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively.


Propelled higher by D.R. Horton's strong results, Meritage is extended past a 117.32 buy point, while PulteGroup shares moved out of buy range beyond a 59.34 cup-with-handle buy point. The daily chart shows the stock is still in buy range from a 60.99 entry.


Following big gains on April 13, the stock market has quietly traded sideways, which can be viewed as bullish action. Amid the mostly calm action and light distribution-day count, IBD's recommended exposure remains at 40% to 60%.

A conflicted stock market closed mixed Monday, as small caps took advantage of positive news in regional banks to lead Wall Street.




The Russell 2000 rallied 1.1% as it tries to climb from support around the 1700 level.


SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) rose 0.9% after **First Citizens BancShares** ([FCNCB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNCB)) [acquired most assets of the failed Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-citizens-acquires-much-of-failed-silicon-valley-bank-5a4545f?mod=article_inline). First Citizens shares soared 53.7%, its largest gain on record.


With the deal, First Citizens becomes one of the top 25 banks in the nation. **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)), hammered by banking fears, bounced nearly 12%.


The S&P 500 reduced its gain to 0.2%. The Nasdaq trailed with a 0.5% decline as techs lagged. Technology Select Sector SPDR ([XLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLK)) was the poorest S&P sector ETF, down 0.8%. The Communications Services ETF fell 0.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MP032723-288x300.jpg)The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%. **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and financials led the Dow.


Volume fell modestly on the NYSE and Nasdaq. On a day when growth underperformed, the IBD 50 index fellÂ 0.2%.


Treasurys were active as banking pressures eased. The 10-year yield surged nearly 15 basis points to 3.53%, the largest single-day increase since Sept. 26, according to Dow Jones Market data. The two-year yield rose nearly 0.23 basis points to 4.00%, resulting in a more-inverted yield curve.


Mixed Signals Hamstring Investors
---------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue with a rally attempt that started about two weeks ago. But so far there's been no [follow-through signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) to confirm a new uptrend. That's left the stock market in an ambiguous spot, making tentative progress only to bump up against sellers.


Last week, indexes rose more than 1%, yet the most significant session was Wednesday's bearish reversal.


Lacking a clear signal, investors should remain with an exposure of 0% to no more than 20%.


To be sure, indexes have some things to build on. The Nasdaq broke above a trend line touching its highs from Feb. 2. The S&P 500 formed a similar trend line, but hasn't moved above it.


Scanning through the [MarketSmith 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) index, dozens of stocks in homebuilding, semiconductors, software, consumer and other sectors are setting up in bases. Many others are already in buy areas.


Stock Market Indicators Mixed
-----------------------------


However, the advance-decline lines of the Nasdaq and NYSE are not only weakening, but also diverging lower from the stock market indexes.


In the last two weeks, while indexes have been rebounding, the 10-day average of NYSE new lows has turned sharply higher than the 10-day average of new lows. The same trend is occurring in the market-leading Nasdaq.


The NYSE's 10-day average of total down volume has expanded this month, to the highest in at least a year. On the Nasdaq, the 10-day average of up volume vs. down volume is nearly even.


After successfully testing its 3800 level this month, the S&P 500 reclaimed the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). But the 50-day line, at around 4000, remains a potential stopping point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq has stalled just below the 12,000 level.


Energy groups accounted for nine of the 13 best-performing industry groups as the sector led the stock market. From another point of view, the industries with the most new highs were defensive groups including soft drinks, personal care and cosmetics, drug wholesalers and health care services.

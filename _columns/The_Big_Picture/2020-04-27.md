  S&P 500, Russell 2000 Reclaim Key Levels, But Breakouts Lack Conviction

After a down week, the stock market Monday gave indications that it's ready to resume its monthlong advance. Small caps, [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and other indexes offered favorable signs.




The S&P 500 added a bit of breathing room above its 50-day moving average. Last week, the index struggled with its 50-day line as the market paused from a fast rebound. But the S&P 500 closed above the key line on Friday, and on Monday, the S&P 500 climbed 1.5%. The Nasdaq composite — which held above its 50-day average throughout the market pause — topped last week's highs after climbing 1.1% Monday.


It's harder to read chart signals on the Dow Jones Industrial Average because only 30 stocks are in the index, and all of them big caps. But the Dow also made a positive move, rising back above its 50-day line. The industrials added 1.5% also. Indexes closed near session highs.


If there was one index that truly stood out it was the Russell 2000. The small-cap benchmark leaped 4% and briefly edged above its own 50-day price average. Smaller companies have fewer resources to tolerate losses caused by a black swan event like the coronavirus pandemic. That was one factor that caused the Russell 2000 to fall more than the Nasdaq and S&P 500 this year.

Not that the road back is clear at all. The pandemic is far from contained, and reopening stores, offices and factories will require measured steps.


Beyond S&P 500: More Breakouts, But Low Volume
----------------------------------------------


While indexes were doing their part for the market, leading stocks also were contributing as well.


After going weeks with a shortage of [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), the market is now furnishing plenty. About two dozen stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or better topped [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But nearly all of them showed light volume.


Only **Checkpoint Software** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)) had ample volume (57% above average), but the stock closed below the 108.50 buy point. The company posted a mild 8% gain in first-quarter earnings per share and a 3% revenue lift.


So, for all the strength in numbers, the breakout list Monday lacked institutional muscle. Sometimes, [volume can take days to appear in a breakout stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-apple-nvidia-breakouts-still-worked-despite-light-volume/), so these moves weren't necessarily bad. But it was curious that trading in so many fell flat at a critical time. Volume edged higher on the Nasdaq and appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


The IBD 50 climbed 1.3%. Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) closed above its 50-day line for the first time since Feb. 21, when the coronavirus crisis started.



The stock market faces a huge week of [earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), with hundreds of companies on the docket. Bellwethers such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are reporting. Those five companies combine for more than one-third of the Nasdaq's total weighting and for much of the S&P 500, making this week all the more important — and risky — for Wall Street.


More Companies Miss Profit Views
--------------------------------


While everyone expects first-quarter earnings to be poor, more companies are missing EPS estimates than normal. As of Friday, nearly one-fourth of the S&P 500 companies had announced results. The percentage of companies beating earnings per share estimates was 60% and below the five-year average of 73%, according to FactSet. Combined with companies yet to report, earnings are 5.1% below estimates, which is also below the five-year average.


In terms of Q1 sales, 60% of S&P 500 companies beat views, which is above the five-year average. Including actual and estimated sales, sales are 0.5% above estimates, which is below the five-year average.


Investors can expect to lose some visibility on earnings as more companies withdraw forecasts. FactSet reviewed the earnings call transcripts of the 122 S&P 500 companies that had posted results, and 30 withdrew previous EPS guidance for 2020. All 30 cited the uncertainty over Covid-19. Industrial and consumer staples companies were most often in that group.


And, oh yes, the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday on interest rates. Coronavirus news and Q1 earnings overshadow this month's Fed meeting, although traders don't expect any change from the zero-rate policy. The Fed went into emergency mode in March, dropping rates to a 0%-0.25% target range and injecting hundreds of billions in liquidity.

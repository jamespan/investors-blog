Did the stock market keep one of its old habits yet again — sell on the rumor, buy on the news?


Judging by the recent few weeks of action, amid new clues that the sellers are getting tired, Investor's Business Daily readers might want to carefully assess the price-and-volume movement over the next few days now that America's so-called "Liberation Day" — coming through salvos of heavy tariffs on all its trading partners — has finally arrived.




Stock Market Today: Trump Talk Hits Futures
-------------------------------------------


President Donald Trump had planned to discuss [how America would engage reciprocal tariffs on imported goods](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-tariffs-president-reciprocal-tariffs-liberation-day-sp-500/) in order to counter the tariffs placed by various countries on U.S. exports. Ahead of that scheduled 4 p.m. ET announcement, the stock market decided to stage a decent rebound.


The intraday swings on Wednesday? Choppy for sure. And yet, by the trading day's close, the Nasdaq composite managed to rally 0.8%, ahead of a 0.5% lift by the S&P 500. Small caps prevailed. The Russell 2000 moved 1.3% higher.


But then Trump detailed country-specific measures as well as a 10% baseline tariff on all countries exporting their goods to the U.S. in an outdoor event at the White House. Stock market futures then tanked. At around 4:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq 100 futures caved 2.4% while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.6%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP040225.jpg)On Wednesday, the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell, sending the yield up 4 basis points to 4.19%.


Meanwhile, the NYSE composite's modest rise was still telling in that this index has continued to hold its ground at the long-term 200-day moving average. As seen on an [Investors.com chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/amex-nyse-composite-index-0nyc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily), the NYSE composite advanced for the third straight day.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6% to 42,225. After rising 13.7% in 2024, the 30-stock blue-chip index is down 0.7% so far this year.


Volume shot 20% higher on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, early data showed on [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF). Trading on the New York Stock Exchange cooled 5%.


Looking at the sector indexes, the stock market showed a heavier appetite for "risk-on" equities. For instance, one of the day's best-performing sector exchange traded funds was the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) ETF, rising 1.9% to 203.31.


The fund remains a few hairs below its long-term [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). That rise marked its third straight gain in above-average volume, but the ETF remains 12% lower year to date.


In contrast, Consumer Staples SPDR ([XLP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLP)) edged down 0.3% to 81.55. Yet that fund holds a modest gain of 3.9% since Jan. 1.

Bears Vs. Bulls

Nonetheless, pessimism, even among veterans on Wall Street, is palpable.


"In a worst-case scenario, earnings downgrades could push (the S&P 500 tracking index ETF) SPY another 5%-10% lower, invert the yield curve, and send volatility (VIX) past 30," Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at Easterly EAB, wrote in a note sent to IBD.


And yet, under the hood of the stock market, are investors seeing a growing number of stocks that are showing a little more strength lately?


Take **Brinker International** ([EAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAT)). A huge winner in 2024, the operator of the Chili's and Maggiano's restaurant chains has fallen from 192.22 to 131.78 over a five-week span. Pointwise, that's a lot of selling. But on a percentage basis, the 30.4% correction actually fits within the mold of a potentially great cup base.



Notice on a daily chart how Brinker recently tested upside resistance at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). While shares cooled again recently, another push back above the 50-day line would be bullish. Why? It shows several things going on. First, the bulls in Brinker stock are accumulating shares at a discount after the recent sell-off.


Two, the stock is making progress getting through an overhead supply of disgruntled holders who are jumping at the opportunity to sell the stock in order to get out with a small loss or break even. And three, a continued rebound would hint that the stock bottomed out last month.


At 155.25, Brinker still trades more than 19% below its 192.22 high. So, it's still not at the right place in which to [break out to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

Stock Market Today: IPO Stocks To Eye
-------------------------------------


The leading sectors within IBD's stock market tables show these in the pole position: In terms of mid- and long-term relative performance, mining, miscellaneous, alcohol/tobacco, insurance and utilities ruled the IBD stock tables. Aerospace ranked sixth. Food and beverage, another defensive sector, came in seventh.


So, viewing strength within the newer plays in the stock market today may perhaps give IBD readers a clearer view of where institutional money might flow.



**CoreWeave** ([CRWV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWV)), meanwhile, traded wildly on Wednesday. Shares hit a high of 64.62, up more than 55% from its initial price offering at 40, before finishing the session up nearly 17% at 61.36.


The company operates a cloud-based platform to help customers scale up their offerings using generative artificial intelligence. CoreWeave posted $747 million in fourth-quarter sales, up an astounding 544% vs. the prior year's quarter. The company shaved its net loss to 11 cents a share from 35 cents a share.


"CoreWeave is a polarizing stock for investors," Barron's Tech newsletter writer Tae Kim said in a column Wednesday. "Bears question future demand for CoreWeave's cloud, its highly leveraged balance sheet, and the business model itself. Conversely, the bulls see a best-in-class company atop the burgeoning GPU cloud market."


Among other recent IPOs, **Marex** ([MRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRX)) surged 8.9% to 38.84 on Wednesday. Shares of the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/financial-stock-marex-group-mrx-stock-of-the-day/) are close to taking out a 40.05 high while building a narrow base. Aerospace and defense play **Karman** ([KRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRMN)) also outperformed the major indexes, rising 2.8% to 34.58. The company priced its IPO at $22 a share in February.


Another recent IPO, oil-and gas field owner **LandBridge** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) rose 2.6% to 74.54, just below a recent breakout point of 76.22 from an [eight-week double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).


Boca Raton, Fla.-based **Newsmax** ([NMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMAX)) is a true wild card in the IPO market. After more than doubling in price on Tuesday, shares in the conservative-leaning media company plunged 180.48 points, or 77.5%, to 52.52. Even after that dramatic fall, Newsmax is up nearly fivefold from its IPO at 10.


If the economy somehow holds up and even strengthens, could that lift the IPO market? Some market observers are not so sure.


The Future IPO Pipeline
-----------------------


Among the best-run privately held companies, "many are choosing not to (go public) at this stage. We're at a different place than before," said Eric Schiffer, a private equity veteran.


Schiffer, who also is chairman of the Patriarch Organization, a family office investment firm with $100 million in assets under management, told IBD: "In the past, there was always this direct exit (via a new IPO) at a multiple that would satisfy partners at scale."


According to IBD data, [the ratio of new issues as a percentage of stocks on the NYSE](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DailyPsycho_040125.pdf) on March 31 hit a 12-month high of 8.1%. Go to IBD Data Tables, then click on "Psychological Indicators And Volume" to check this statistic every day.


Schiffer is highly upbeat, however, about the future of new public companies that focus on the artificial intelligence space and related industries, including cybersecurity.


"Disruptive innovation with the use of AI will be the driver for that. It's still early innings, and (AI-related applications are) only getting better, smarter," Schiffer said. He feels the cybersecurity space could also become a leading area of growth for stock market investors.


However, Schiffer warns to heed the lesson from DeepSeek. That is, the big legacy enterprise software firms could see their competitive moats filled in by a new class of startups that take advantage of the growing ease and falling cost in which to develop new software applications.


"When you can have an AI startup with great distribution capabilities, watch out," he said.


Consider **SailPoint** ([SAIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAIL)), which rallied 3.6% to 18.95 yet remains below its IPO price of $23. The stock stands more than 28% below its February high of 26.35. Earnings estimates are robust, showing 130% growth to 17 cents a share in the fiscal year ending January 2026 and up 47% to 25 cents in fiscal 2027.

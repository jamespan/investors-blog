The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped, while tech stocks rose Thursday as stock market worries over regional banks persisted. **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) dived nearly 9% on weak subscriber growth.




Beverly Hills, Calif.-based **PacWest** ([PACW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PACW)), a heavily battered regional bank, plunged 22.7% Thursday after the company pledged additional assets as collateral and said that its deposits declined 9.5% last week. PACW stock is just off its May 4 lows.


Other regional banks were also lower, as **Western Alliance** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) finished down almost 1%, while **Zions** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)) and **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) lost 4.5% and 6.8%, respectively.


The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) sold off 2.5% to close at its lowest level in a week.


The recently upgraded stock market uptrend sees a number of leading stocks near buy points, including energy drink leader **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


Economic Data, Earnings Movers
------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MP051123-248x300.jpg)Early Thursday, the April producer price index rose 0.2% on the month, with an annual increase of 2.3%, both cooler than estimates. Core prices rose 0.2% month over month and climbed 3.2% year over year. They were also cooler than expected.


Further, first-time unemployment claims jumped to 264,000, their highest level since October 2021. They were expected to rise to 245,000 vs. 242,000 in the previous week.


On Thursday, **Allegro MicroSystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)), Disney,  and **The Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) were on the move after earnings.


Chipmaker Allegro MicroSystems beat analyst expectations for its [fiscal fourth quarter](http://investors.com/news/technology/algm-stock-allegro-microsystems-beats-fiscal-q4-targets/) thanks to robust automotive chip sales. It also guided higher for the current period. ALGM stock climbed 1.8% Thursday.


Disney shares plunged 8.7% after the company's streaming services units missed subscriber growth estimates in its [late Wednesday earnings report.](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-quiet-as-a-mouse-ahead-of-earnings-magic-kingdom-expands-charges-against-sunshine-state/) DIS stock broke below its 50- and 200-day moving averages in heavy trading.


[Trade Desk on Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ttd-stock-trade-desk-earnings-q1-2023/) reported March-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates as internet TV drove growth for the self-service ad company. TTD stock climbed sharply early Thursday, but closed down 0.7%, unable to hold its 66.45 buy point.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%, extending a losing streak to four sessions. The index bounced off its 50-day line, however. The S&P 500 declined 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.8%.


Volume dropped on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE vs. the prior session. The Nasdaq's [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell to four after the April 5 distribution day dropped off the count due to the time rule. Trading sessions more than 25 days old are considered no longer relevant to the current stock market action. The S&P 500's count remains at five.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lost 0.1%, closing just above its 50-day line. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), biotech leader **Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)) plunged more than 19% despite reporting strong growth, breaking down below its 50- and 200-day lines. On the upside, **Copa Holdings** ([CPA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPA)) soared 10.6%, breaking out past a 98.22 buy point.


[Wednesday's march to new 2023 highs](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-cheers-falling-inflation-as-u-s-hurtles-toward-debt-cliff/) on the Nasdaq prompted a market-trend upgrade from "uptrend under pressure" to "confirmed uptrend." Despite the acknowledgment of better action in recent sessions,  IBD's recommended exposure in stocks remains at 20% to 40% of your portfolio.

Stock Market Leaders To Watch: Celsius, Salesforce Break Out
------------------------------------------------------------



Celsius stock soared nearly 20% Wednesday after the company's strong Q1 earnings. Shares broke out past a cup base's 122.34 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). The 5% buy zone goes up to 128.46.


Celsius touts itself as a healthier energy brand. The Boca Raton, Fla.-based company makes caffeinated, sparkling beverages and pre- and post-workout supplements in a variety of flavors. [Celsius is the No. 3 energy drink brand in the U.S.](https://www.investors.com/research/celsius-stock-energy-drink-leader-soars-above-buy-point-on-record-sales/) behind Red Bull and **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)).


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock Salesforce rallied past alternative entries at 194.01 and 200.10 in recent sessions, according to Leaderboard analysis. Meanwhile, the RS line hit a new high this week, a bullish signal.



AMD, Netflix Eye Buy Points
---------------------------


Chip leader Advanced Micro Devices continues to rally up the right side of a cup base that has a 102.53 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). Monday's surge saw AMD stock climb above an early trendline entry, using May 4's high of 91.64 mark as the buy point.


[Recent IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/nflx-stock-netflix-shares-near-buy-point/) Netflix popped above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) Monday. That positive action earlier in the week created a buying opportunity for aggressive investors. Further, Netflix shares now are nearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 349.90 out of a [cup-with-handle base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) NFLX stock rose 2.8% Thursday, leaving it just 1% away from the next buy point.

Small Caps, Commodity Plays Lead Decline; Time To Sell These Leading Growth Stocks?
====================================================================================

Rotate, rotate, rotate? Years from now, many a [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) stock enthusiast may look back at 2021 and think this: Well, if only I had taken profits in a few more growth stocks a little earlier than usual, the overall performance would have sharply improved.




Today, one only need look at names such as **Navios Maritime Partners** ([NMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMM)) (down 11%, sinking beneath its 50-day moving average in fast turnover) and **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) (down 10.5%, testing its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), volume screaming 137% above usual levels) to reaffirm how [selling at least some shares on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) makes sense.


Navios triggered a [defensive sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) Tuesday, just days after a making a nifty reversal near its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) on May 13.


Growth Stocks Eventually Do This
--------------------------------



Such buying support at the 50-day line and [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) did not happen Tuesday. Star Bulk, which got some air play in the May 13 IBD Live show as it violated an upper channel, still has room above its own rising 50-day line.


The major stock market averages did not mirror a 3.7% price-weighted foundering by IBD's Transportation-Ship industry group. This group headed into Tuesday's trading ranked No. 11 out of 197 industries for six-month price performance.


Indeed, some sector indexes paced the general decline.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund halted a three-session win streak. A 0.9% decline gutted more than half of its 1.6% advance over that short period. Midcaps followed suit; a 0.7% reversal lower by SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) topped losses of 0.2% to 0.3% for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.


The Dow Jones transportation average lost 1%.


Mild Distribution
-----------------


![MP052521](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052521-192x300.jpg)As volume rose vs. the prior day on both the Nasdaq and NYSE, the S&P 500's drop was large enough to warrant calling it a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Yet the distribution count for the S&P 500 remains at seven, because the April 20 sell-off expired on time. The April 22 distribution day on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq is slated to fall off the count on Thursday.


Meanwhile, strength in semiconductor stocks cushioned the blow for the Nasdaq composite, which edged just 4 points lower.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) inched up 0.1%. At 332.97, the ETF mirroring the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq stood 2.9% beneath its all-time high.


Commodity stocks also suffered. Early MarketSmith data showed that more than two dozen industry groups got slammed with losses of 2% or more. They ranged from oil and gas field services, integrated oil producers and steel to life insurance and machinery automation.

Is This Sector Getting Whacked?
-------------------------------



Like the shipping firms, banking stocks also got blindsided. No doubt, they weighed on the Russell 2000.


 **South State** ([SSB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSB)), part of the southeast banks industry group, dropped nearly 4.8% in accelerating turnover. The stock also ducked below its 21-day exponential moving average.


On Friday, the lender poked above a 91.59 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a 10-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). But as you can see on a daily chart, the breakout move came in decelerating turnover. That's the exact opposite of what you want to see.


The stock got promptly yanked from the [Ready List on IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).


Long-dated U.S. government bond yields plunged on Tuesday. Cboe data showed the yield on 10-year Treasuries slumped 4 basis points to 1.56% — 20 basis points below its March 30 peak.

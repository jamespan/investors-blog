Stock Market Rallies On Jobs Report As Nasdaq Hits Record High
===============================================================

For the first time in more than three months, the Nasdaq composite climbed to a record high, the latest sign that the stock market is shedding fears.




The Nasdaq topped the July 26 high, closing virtually at session highs after a 1.1% increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1% and cleared the Sept. 12 high. It needs less than 1% to make an all-time high. The S&P 500 added 1% and made it the fourth record high in the past five days.


The S&P 500 is leading the market lately, even though it still lags the Nasdaq in year-to-date performance. Why? Part of the reason is the shift in market leadership, which has favored many big-cap S&P 500 companies.


At almost one month from the Oct. 3 market lows, the best performing industry groups in that span are a mix of industrial, materials, auto, health care, semiconductor and other odd groups. The wood products group, for instance, is up nearly 24%; heavy machinery nearly 19%; managed care more than 11%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP110119-262x300.jpg)Friday's [strong jobs report for October](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-us-adds-128000-jobs-despite-gm-strike-dow-jones-rises/) was all the stock market needed to make new highs. U.S. employers added 128,000 jobs in October, above forecasts for 90,000. Job gains for August and September were revised higher.


Meantime, the market seems to be acclimating to the U.S.-China trade war. Headlines Thursday that China is hesitating to [sign a long-term trade agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/how-the-stock-market-ends-the-year-is-now-up-to-trump-investors-say.html) met with a cool response on Wall Street. On Friday, reports said China and U.S. negotiators have [a broad consensus](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/china-says-its-reached-a-consensus-in-principle-with-the-us-during-this-weeks-trade-talks.html).


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve [cut the fed funds rate](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/small-caps-lag-trucking-stocks-suddenly-skid/), and suggested it may be done cutting rates for now. Again, that did not concern most investors.


Stock Market Indicators Improve
-------------------------------


Market indicators are improving. The Sept. 27 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were erased because of a five-week time lapse. Only a few, manageable distribution days remain. The [Accumulation/Distribution Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 improved to B- as of Thursday.


Last month, the market not only survived a run-up of eight distribution days — some of them serious — but indexes continued rising. That's not to diminish the importance of distribution. From late August to early October 2018, the Nasdaq piled up nine distribution days and the market topped.


If the stock market is settling in for a continued run, it is giving growth investors plenty of opportunities. **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)), **Avery Dennison** ([AVY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVY)) and **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) are part of a diverse group of well-performing [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Payment stocks **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) and orthopedics maker **Stryker** ([SYK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYK)) are in [early-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).

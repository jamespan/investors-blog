The stock market jumped on a strong jobs report Thursday before trimming gains in late-day trade, as the stock market rally continued. The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.5% to record highs, although it had been up as much as 1.5%.




The S&P 500 also moved up 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 followed up with a mild 0.3% gain. Leading growth stocks were also squarely higher, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose 0.5%. Volume was lower on both exchanges vs. Wednesday's session.


Stock Market Rally Extends Gains On Jobs Report
-----------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Nasdaq extended its win streak to four sessions. The tech-heavy composite hit a record high after a [strong jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/june-jobs-report-rocks-record-jobs-unemployment-rate-falls-dow-jones/). The U.S. economy gained a record 4.8 million jobs, while the unemployment rate declined to 11.1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP070220-228x300.jpg)May's jobs report — on June 5 — led to bigger gains than on Thursday. The Nasdaq jumped 2.05% after the May jobs report. Thursday's more tempered response could be due to record daily new coronavirus cases. Last month's jobs report was also a bigger shock. Employment rose by 2.5 million in May, while Wall Street expected a loss of 7.7 million jobs.


Bullishly, the June 26 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the count. When an index rises 5% from the closing price of distribution day, it is considered no longer relevant to the current market trend. The Nasdaq has just one distribution day remaining, while the S&P 500 still has four.

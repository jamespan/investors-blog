The market traded in tight range Monday — something it's been doing a lot lately — as major averages held near highs, refusing to give up much ground.


The Nasdaq gained a fraction, but the S&P 500 ended its six-session winning streak and closed fractionally lower. Volume dropped sharply from Friday's heightened levels, which swelled on options and futures expirations. NYSE volume eased 35% from Friday while Nasdaq volume softened 32%.


The IBD 50 continued its recent outperformance, rising 0.3%. Last week, the index soared 3.4%, more than doubling a 1.4% gain for the S&P 500.


In economic news, May existing-home sales rose 4.9% to 4.89 million units, the fastest pace in seven months, and ahead of expectations for 4.75 million. IBD's homebuilding group outperformed with a gain of around 0.5%.


Group leader **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) gave back early gains ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open. It closed 0.4% lower. Lennar is working on a base-on-base pattern with a buy point of 42.38.


Amid constant chatter of a market that's ripe for a pullback, sell signals remain few and far between. The distribution day count in the Market Pulse to the right is still mild with two for the S&P 500 and one for the Nasdaq in recent weeks. Even better, the market has served up plenty of fresh breakouts, and leading growth stocks are generally behaving well post-breakout.


Still, fearful headlines remain plentiful. Three more made the rounds Monday, including one that said "Stocks are dangerously overvalued." Another asked: "Are we setting up for a 2011-type crash?" And still another warned: "Housing could roil market."


Pundits point toward growing market risk — partly due to instability in Iraq and rising oil prices. But looking at the price and volume in the major averages, the market seems oblivious to those risks. For now, Wall Street seems to be focused on an improving U.S. economy and a dovish Fed.


IBD's Auto-Manufacturing industry group was one of the day's top performers, rising about 3%. **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) provided most of the fuel as shares rose just over 3%. It's only 10% off its high as it works on a cup-shaped base. Group peer **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)) is working on a rare ascending base with a 41.28 entry.


Other cup-shaped bases taking shape among high-rated stocks include **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)).


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM))are nearing buy points of cup-with-handle patterns.

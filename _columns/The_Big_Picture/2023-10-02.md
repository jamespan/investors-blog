If the stock market has just started its best period of the year, Monday's mixed action surely didn't show it.




The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% but it was a deceptive gain. That's because giants such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) accounted for much of the Nasdaq's increase. Even **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) reversed higher despite [missing estimates for its third-quarter deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-q3-deliveries-fell-as-wall-street-stays-focused-on-positives/).


Remove the tech battleships, and a flotilla of thousands of other stocks were adrift Monday. First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) fell 0.2%.


The S&P 500 rose not even one point and also would have been worse off without big caps. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) tumbled 1.1% and is testing the June lows.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by a 7-3 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 4-to-1 on the NYSE. Volume edged up on the NYSE and fell on the Nasdaq vs. Friday's totals.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared losses but still lost 0.2%.


Yields, Small Caps In Motion
----------------------------


A 16-year high in the 10-year Treasury yield no doubt hurt the stock market, although growth stocks fared relatively better. The benchmark yield climbed 11 basis points to 4.68% — the highest since Oct. 12, 2007, based on 3 p.m. ET quotes.


![MarketPulse](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP100223-274x300.jpg)A surprise deal over the weekend to avoid a government shutdown fed into bond selling, which raised yields. Manufacturing data was another reason to sell bonds. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey rose to 49% in September. It was the third straight increase and matched a 10-month high.


Small caps extended a rout. The Russell 2000 slid 1.6% and sank to the lowest level in four months. The index is now down for the year.


The IBD 50 index eased 0.1%.


Technology and Communications Services were the only S&P 500 sectors that rose Monday.


Stock Market Historical Trend More Favorable
--------------------------------------------


Historically, the stock market does best in the fourth quarter of the year. The S&P 500 averages a 2.8% increase, compared with gains of 1.3%-2.3% in the other quarters. The Nasdaq averages a 4.4% fourth-quarter gain, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That compares with 0.4%-3.6% gains for the first three quarters.


October also has [the most follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-october-is-best-month-for-confirmed-rallies-trick-to-that-treat/).


While September is historically the worst month for the stock market, the sun starts to come out in October. The S&P 500 averages a gain of 0.9% and the Nasdaq 0.7%, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. But in pre-election years (such as 2023) those index gains are 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.


The market looks set to rebound in Q4, says Nationwide Chief of Investment Research Mark Hackett. But he sees three reasons for a cautious outlook.


"First, economists' expectations of a recession went from being universally negative to significantly more positive – making it even harder for the market to meet expectations," he said.


"Second, consumer spending power is likely to run out of steam, especially given how consumer credit card usage has increased. Finally, we are seeing margin pressure driven by rising wages and higher costs for companies, which is exacerbated by a strong dollar and high interest rates."


Stock Market Sectors In Rotation
--------------------------------


The energy sector, which had been holding up and leading the stock market, suddenly looks vulnerable.


Energy Select Sector SPDR ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) — which was the only of 11 S&P sectors to rise in September — fell 2% Monday. The exchange traded fund closed below the 50-day line for the first time since July 6.



Nymex crude for November delivery fell 2.2% to $88.82 a barrel. It was the largest single-day decline since Aug. 2.


"The global outlook is quickly taking a turn for the worse and that is both driving the king dollar trade again and weighing on the crude demand outlook," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in an analysis Monday.


Rising Treasury yields also are hurting dividend-rich sectors. Utilities were the worst S&P 500 sector, down nearly 4.7%. Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)) lost 1.8%.


Utility stocks **NextEra Energy** ([NEE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEE)) (down 9%), **AES Corp.** ([AES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AES)) (down 6.8%) and **NiSource** ([NI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NI)) (off 6.1%) were three of the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500.


Attractive yields for Treasuries and CDs are also making it hard for equities to compete for investor capital. Yet the major stock market indexes remain above their Sept. 27 lows. As long as that's the case, a chance for a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) is in play.


For now, look for stocks setting up in bases. It may not be smart to buy now, but when the stock market starts a new uptrend, you'll know what to start buying.

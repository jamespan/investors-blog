The bulls ruled the roost again on the stock market Friday after the September jobs came in well above expectations.




The Russell 2000 small-cap index led the way, up 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8%. Dow component **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) was a top gainer among blue chips, up 3.5% ahead of next week's [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-calendar-jpmorgan-blackrock-delta-air-lines/). Results are due Friday before the open. Fellow Dow player **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) rallied 3% to an all-time high.


The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.2%, helped by news that [nonfarm payrolls](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-sp-500/) increased 254,000 in September, nearly double economists' projections for 132,500, according to Econoday.


Just after 4 p.m. ET, the 10-year Treasury yield was up 12 basis points to around 3.97%. According to CME FedWatch, another 50-basis-point rate cut at the November Fed meeting is off the table. Prior to the jobs data, the market envisioned 75 basis points in rate cuts before the end of the year. Now it expects 50 basis points in cuts.


Stock Market: Nasdaq Volume Slightly Lower
------------------------------------------


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq composite. The Aug. 29 distribution day for the Nasdaq fell off the count due to time. On the Nasdaq exchange, winners beat losers by more than 2-to-1.



The S&P 500 added 0.9%, shrugging off some selling in homebuilding stocks like **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) and **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), which closed with losses ranging from 2.5% to 2.9%.


D.R. Horton and Lennar are testing their 50-day moving averages. Pulte, a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock, paid a visit to its 21-day exponential moving average and is still about 5% above its 50-day line.


Volume dipped on the New York Stock Exchange as well, with advancing stocks beating decliners by less than 2-to-1.


Good News For Bulls
-------------------


The bullish session for the stock market was a reminder that 80%-100% exposure is a good place to be, especially with the Nasdaq composite in position to try breaking out past its Sept. 26 high.


Leadership has broadened out with plenty of setups to consider. **DigitalOcean** ([DOCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCN)), **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) all gave buy signals.


West Texas Intermediate crude oil rallied another 0.9% and settled at $74.38 a barrel, bringing its weekly gain to 9%. **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) climbed 1.8% to an all-time high and extended its winning streak to six sessions.


New issue **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 69.11 entry. The 5% buy zone stretches to 72.57. Reddit's weekly chart shows four straight weekly gains. The stock could try to add another handle as Reddit approaches its all-time high of 78.08.

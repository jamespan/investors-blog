  Stocks Mostly Silent; Will Next Sound Be From Bull Or Bear?

U.S. stock indexes paused to rest Friday, taking a break from both recent selling and the so-called Trump rally.


The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and small-cap S&P 600 were virtually flat. The Dow and the IBD 50 each slipped 0.1%.


![mp120516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP120516-193x300.png)Volume fell across the board. The Oct. 27 [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) was deleted from the count because it is now too old.


The indexes suffered their first weekly losses since the presidential election. This naturally raises the question of whether a bigger pullback is in store, or if the bullish trend is still intact.


While this might seem like a time to force a guess on which way the market will go, the IBD method is to dance to the music the market is playing now.


The standard IBD playbook:


* Cut losses at 7% or 8%. You don't want to see a loss grow to the point where you become the accidental long-term investor. Collecting mistakes is not a strategy.
* Take profits when a stock is up 20% to 25%. That's where most gains from breakouts stall. Perhaps there is one stock in your portfolio with such good action and sterling fundamentals that you intend to hold through a pullback. That's fine, just don't do it with your whole portfolio.
* Increase your awareness. Right now, the Trump trade over the past four weeks has designated steel, oil drillers, heavy construction and banks as the leaders. A surprise winner is the diversified-operations group, which is up 22% in four weeks.



Stocks in that group include **Seaboard** ([SEB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEB)) and **Leucadia National** ([LUK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUK)). Strength in the diversified group could be a sign of caution in the market or a sign of growing confidence in the economy.


On the downside, avoid the following groups, all big losers over the past four weeks: gold miners, dairy, meat and solar.


* Be patient. Maybe you missed some winners when the Trump rally first unfolded. If the uptrend is for real, new breakouts will emerge. Misses are a reminder to build a better watchlist.
* Make portfolio management your focus. This is where performance is most often won or lost.


The Nasdaq lost  2.7% for the week; the IBD 50, 2.6%; the small-cap S&P 600, 1.9%; and the S&P 500, 1%. The Dow managed a 0.1% gain.


**Market footnote**: One statistic that underlines how extreme the market action has been is the trailing 10-day performance for the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq. The difference between the two indexes reached roughly 9% on two days in November. You have to go back to 1999-2002 to find a similar divergence.

Small Caps Surge; 11 Stocks That Could Break Out Soon
======================================================

Small caps led the stock market higher Friday, but the Nasdaq set the pace with the biggest weekly gain.




 The small-cap Russell 2000 hustled ahead 1.2% Friday, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average inched ahead 0.2%.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume rose, according to preliminary data.


For the week, the Nasdaq climbed 1%, the S&P 500 0.9% and the Dow 1%.


Breakouts were unimpressive Friday, with some stocks clearing entries but in slow trade.

**CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)), an October IPO, rattled 6% higher to clear a 35.52 buy point. Volume was heavy. The car dealership chain lost 2 cents a share in 2015, gained 6 cents a share in 2016 and is expected to earn 11 cents a share when the company reports 2017 results.


The other IPO breakout was China-based **Rise Education** ([REDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REDU)). The stock surged above a 15.76 handle entry in heavy volume.


After two years of losses, Rise turned a profit of 15 cents a share in 2016. The Street expects a $1.71 a share profit when 2017 results are reported.


Many stocks aren't ready to break out yet, but are trading in bases, not too far from a buy point.


These are worth attention because they could provide candidates for a near-term watch list. Individual investors should not buy before the breakout. A breakout may not happen.


The one exception is when a stock crosses above a trend line in strong volume. A trend line involves a line drawn along multiple highs within the base.


Stocks that are in bases and could break out include these 11: **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), **General Dynamics** ([GD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GD)), **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Monsanto** ([MON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MON)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Mindbody** ([MB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MB)), **Control4** ([CTRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRL)) and **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)).


Study the stocks' fundamentals before adding to a watch list, and check the earnings reporting date.


Shutdown Standoff
-----------------


In political news the market is watching, Democrats in the U.S. Senate appeared ready to say no to any spending bill unless President Trump offers concessions to avoid a government shutdown.


The most recent government shutdown was Oct. 1-17, 2013. During that shutdown the Nasdaq initially fell 4.4% over six sessions and then rebounded 5% over the next six sessions.


A brief pullback like that might be welcomed by the bulls.

  Stock Market Fades Late; Nasdaq Notches 6th Straight Gain, Helped By Tesla, Facebook

The Nasdaq composite extended its winning streak to six sessions Wednesday. But sellers came into the stock market late, resulting in aÂ [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) for the Nasdaq.




The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 small-cap index hit fresh highs, but early gains faded. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones ended with tiny losses, and the Nasdaq edged up less than 0.1% after rising 0.3% intraday. But the day's narrow price range muted the significance of the Nasdaq's stalling action.


The Russell 2000 added 0.25%. Nasdaq volume came in higher than Tuesday, partly due to heavy-volume gains for Nasdaq 100 stocks like **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) as well as [FANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


The Dow Jones Transportation Average had a tough day, down 0.9%. A 10% plunge in **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) shares after the company [reported weak earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/fedex-earnings-due-china-trade-deal-amazon-fedex-stock-falls/)weighed on the index. The Nov. 12 stalling session for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell off the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) Wednesday because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant. Wednesday's stalling, though, kept the distribution-day count unchanged on the Nasdaq.


Bullish Sentiment
-----------------


Meanwhile, bullish sentiment is still out there, according to the latest weekly survey of newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence. And that's not necessarily a good thing. The bulls rose to 57.7% in the latest week, up from 53.3% the prior week. In mid-July, the bulls were at 58%, just ahead of an 8% pullback for the Nasdaq. Remember, this is a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong when it comes to timing the market.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MP121819.jpg)The new data comes on the heels of a put-call volume ratio that last Friday hit an unusually low level of 0.60. It's another contrarian indication. A high put-call ratio, indicating excessive bearishness, has been seen at market bottoms in the past. And a low ratio has been seen at many market tops. The last time the put-call ratio was at 0.60 was on June 20, about a month before a 6.8% pullback for the S&P 500.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Wednesday's session yielded a couple of solid earnings movers. Uniform maker **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising 2% to 265.88, but gains faded with the broad market. It's still forming a flat base with a 277.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Office furniture maker **Steelcase** ([SCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCS)) gapped up powerfully on [earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/steelcase-earnings-q3-2019-herman-miller-earnings/), clearing a 19.74 buy point. In this case, the stock's open price of 21.40 could've been used as a proper entry.



Among other [stock market movers](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), **Yeti** ([YETI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YETI)) outperformed in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up more than 2% to 34.05. The new issue cleared a 34.30 buy point but ended below the entry.


Other top-rated stocks near buy points include **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)).


There's still a lot to like about the stock market rally that became evident Oct. 15, when IBD changed its market outlook to confirmed uptrend. Sell signals in the major stock indexes, and most leading growth stocks, just aren't there.


Portfolio Management
--------------------


Still, if you've got some nice gainers in your portfolio, some pruning before the end of the year might make sense. Identify the leaders and laggards. Give your leaders as much room as possible to work but don't be afraid to take partial profits. Also don't be afraid to cut the laggards loose. Going into the new year on margin comes with some risk.

Breakouts for several leading stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) have worked nicely, reaching gains from buy points of 20% or more. That's always a good profit-taking level because IBD research has shown it's around the time a stock will pause and build a new base.


After the close, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) brought more good news to the chip sector with a solid earnings report. Shares were up 3% in after-hours trading.


Micron cleared a 50 buy point ahead of its earnings. Other recent breakouts in the stock market look good, including **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)). Results from Nike are due Thursday after the close.

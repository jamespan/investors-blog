  Stock Market Gains After Post-Fed Beatdown, But This Index Lags; Oil Stocks Hammered

The stock market clambered off the canvas after a brutal beatdown but still ended the week well behind on the judge's scorecards.




It was especially disappointing that not all indexes managed to end positive following Thursday's post-Fed meeting bloodbath.


The Nasdaq was the brightest spot of the day after it rallied 1.4%. Nevertheless, its weekly loss came in at 4.8%, with investors being given a black eye after it undercut lows for the year. It has given up 31% since the start of 2022.


The S&P 500 remains on the ropes after posting a measly gain of 0.2%. It ended the week nearly 6% lower and is trading below all of its main moving averages.


[The performance of the S&P sectors](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) failed to provide a crumb of comfort as they ended the day mixed. Consumer discretionary and technology were among the best performers. A dip in oil prices spilled onto the indexes, with energy the worst area by far.

It ended the day down 0.1%, and is now 18% off where it started the year. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among the top performers.


Bloody Nose For Growth Stock Investors
--------------------------------------


The Russell 2000 ended the day up 1%, nowhere near enough to recoup its losses for the week.


But its performance was strong in comparison to the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), which ended the day down 1.6%. The fund has now fallen 40% this year, and sits 33% below its 200-day moving average.


Fed Chair Powell To Get In The Ring
-----------------------------------


Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will have to do some ducking and weaving when he appears before Congress next week.


Senators are sure to press him on the repercussions of the Fed's raising rates by 75 basis points, something he had previously ruled out.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said the Fed's sharp hike on Wednesday underlined "their commitment to restoring price stability is unconditional."


"Fed chair Powell will defend their hawkish pivot, while also doing damage control over the rising credit risks as a result of their aggressive tightening schedule," he said in a note to clients.


Industry Groups: Body Blow For Oil Stocks
-----------------------------------------


Sometimes the losers are just as important as the winners when it comes to industry groups.



And on Friday this was certainly the case, as highflying oil stocks were sent crumpling to the canvas. Drillers, refiners and integrated giants alike fell hard.


**PDC Energy** ([PDCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDCE)) was among the worst losers, falling 10.8% in big volume. It took a dive below its 50-day line in the process.


Many other energy stocks sold off, including [several that hit sell signals](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/oil-stocks-are-fading-fast-inside-ibd-50/).

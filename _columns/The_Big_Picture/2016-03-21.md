The stock market ended with tiny gains Monday, undeterred by weak February existing-home sales data and comments from Atlanta Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, a well-known inflation hawk.


The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.3%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. The IBD 50 inched up less than 0.1%, and small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq dropped off a cliff from Friday’s witching-elevated levels.


Stocks weakened for a bit in the morning after the National Association of Realtors reported that February existing-home sales fell 7.1% in February to 5.08 million units, a steeper drop than the 5.3 million expected by economists. On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 2.2%, the second-weakest in a year. IBD's homebuilding industry group underperformed, falling 0.6%.


Meanwhile, interest rate-hike talk is still an area of focus for the stock market but seems to carry less weight than it has in the past. That was evident Monday when Lacker, the Richmond Fed President, said a rate hike could come as early as the April meeting. The statement didn’t stir much excitement at all.


![MP032116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MP032116-180x300.jpg)Last week, the Fed telegraphed two more rate hikes this year, down from a prior forecast of four. According to CME Group FedWatch, the probability of a rate hike in April is 7%.


The market uptrend confirmed on Feb. 17 still looks fine, although the Nasdaq is still below its 200-day moving average (currently around 4870), which could prove to be a resistance level. The S&P 500 punched through its 200-day moving average last week without much difficulty.


Heavy-volume gainers in the growth space were once again limited, but IBD 50 name **U.S. Concrete** ([USCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USCR)) made the cut. It cleared a 59.50 cup-with-handle buy point in strong trade, rising 4.5%.


Volume also rolled into **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) again as shares rose more than 2%, but the stock is extended after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base.


Other setups to watch for potential breakouts include **Vantiv** ([VNTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNTV)), **Home Bancshares** ([HOMB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOMB)) and **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)).


TransUnion, a provider of risk-management services, went public less than a year ago at 22.50. It’s working on a cup-with-handle base with a 27.15 entry.

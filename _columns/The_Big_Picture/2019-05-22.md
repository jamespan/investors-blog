  Stock Market Dips As Qualcomm Sell-Off Weighs On Chip Sector

A couple of big blowups in the stock market Wednesday and more weakness in chip stocks didn't have much effect on the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, but small caps lagged again.




Shares of **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) plunged nearly 11% after a judge ruled the company's practices violate antitrust law. The judge ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate licensing agreements, saying its patent-licensing practices "strangled competition."


It's been an up-and-down ride for Qualcomm lately. Shares soared 51% in April after the company won a patent infringement suit against **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Qualcomm's weakness weighed on the Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which fell 2.1%. The chip sector was one of Wednesday's weakest.


In the retail sector, home-improvement chain **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) [cratered nearly 12%](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-earnings-q119-home-depot-stock/) on anÂ earnings miss.

In the software sector, **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) and **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, while **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)), **Avalara** ([AVLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVLR)) and **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) did well in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com).


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite eased 0.4% each, and the S&P 500 slipped 0.3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 0.9%. Of the four stock indexes, the Russell 2000 is the weakest. It's now 12% off its 52-week high and mired below its recently converged 50- and 200-day moving averages.


The S&P 500 almost turned positive after the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET, but sellers came back into the market during the final hour of trading.


Volume on the Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume also lower.


The minutes were interpreted as dovish, as committee members once again reiterated that a patient stance on interest rates could last for "some time." That sent the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 4 basis points to 2.39%. The Fed's next meeting is June 18-19.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


All three indexes remain below their 50-day moving average lines, a potential resistance level to watch. Despite weakening technical pictures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, both indexes remain close to highs and the charts of leading growth stocks overall look pretty good. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) outperformed Wednesday, rising 0.1%.


No doubt stock market bulls are encouraged by a lot of healthy stock charts out there, but the bull camp also realizes that the risk level is elevated. It's hard to make new buys with conviction at this point. Remember that breakouts have the best chance of succeeding when new institutional money is coming in from the sidelines. It's not happening yet, with the stock market still in a correction.

Will earnings fuel a breakout for **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK))? It's just below a 140.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) also reports Thursday after the close. It's trading tightly above its 10-week moving average and still in buy range from a 169.15 entry.


Big Breakout
------------


Wednesday's session didn't yield much in the way of technical breakouts, but **Hexcel** ([HXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HXL)) delivered one. Shares jumped 3.6% to 74.10, good for a breakout over a 72.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)*,* after the company updated its financial guidance through 2021. The company makes structural materials, including carbon fiber and specialty reinforcements for the aerospace industry. 


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) also had a good day as it gets into position for a breakout try. Shares jumped 3% to 38.58 as it vies for a breakout over a 41.02 handle buy point.


Crude Oil Falls Hard
--------------------


U.S. crude oil futures settled at $61.42 a barrel, down 2.7%, after weekly data showed a second straight rise in U.S. crude supplies. The weakness in oil fueled declines of 3% or more in several oil and gas-related industry groups.


Headed into Wednesday, **Cabot Oil & Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)) was just below a 27.74 buy point, but shares slumped 2.7% Wednesday. The oil and gas producer was featured in Wednesday's [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) column.

Earnings reports took a back seat to the Fed Wednesday, and the end result was pretty darn good. Major averages yo-yoed to a bullish close after the Fed, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged but left the door open for a rate hike in December.


Small caps outperformed after a period of lackluster performance. The Russell 2000 jumped 2.9%. The IBD 50 gained 1.6%.


The Nasdaq rose 1.3%, the S&P 500 added 1.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 1.1%. Volume was tracking close to Tuesday's levels for most of the session but picked up the pace late and ended higher. Two distribution days for the Nasdaq on Oct. 13-14 fell off the count because the market has rallied enough past them to make them no longer relevant.


The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to hold off on a rate hike, but the tone of the statement led Wall Street to believe a rate hike in December could be in the offing. Stocks turned lower soon after the Fed announcement but eventually found their footing.


Headed into Wednesday, fed funds futures traders put the odds of rate hike at the December meeting around 33%. After Wednesday's announcement, the odds closed in on 50% but backed off to around 43%.


Recent economic data haven't exactly supported the hawks. Job creation in October was weak at 142,000, and recent manufacturing data have been sluggish.


On Tuesday, consumer confidence data came in well below expectations.


Slowing growth in China is also on the Fed's mind although the Fed downplayed it in Wednesday's statement.


Breadth was solid ahead of the Fed, with advancing stocks beating decliners by about 4-to-1 on both exchanges. At the close, the ratio was roughly the same.


Investment banks and super regional banks outperformed, but headed into Wednesday both groups ranked in the bottom half of IBD's 197 industry rankings.


In the Northeast banks group, **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)) gained over 4%. It's near the top of a base that shows a 155.94 buy point.


Meanwhile, Chicago-based **PrivateBancorp** ([PVTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVTB)) rose about 5%. It's in the early stages of a breakout from a cup-shaped base.


And Nashville, Tenn.-based **Pinnacle Financial Partners** ([PNFP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNFP)) added nearly 3% as it works on a base with a 56.10 entry.

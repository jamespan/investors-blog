The stock market continued to get over its coronavirus anxieties, ascending to close at or near session highs after a dull start. Leading stocks are rocking, with [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) now on top of the major indexes.




Indexes slumbered in the morning, but woke up around 11 a.m. ET. The stock market hardly paused from then on.


Even before the alarm clock went off, leading stocks were already working hard. The IBD 50 outperformed from the starting bell, and closed with a 1.2% increase.


The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.1% and closed above 10,000 for the second time this month. The previous time was June 10, right before the composite [plunged 5.3% on coronavirus worries](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-plunges-coronavirus-fears-top-growth-stocks-dive-apple-stock-falls/). At a close of 10,056 Monday, the Nasdaq is inches away from the record high of 10,086.

Although it's less of an indicator, the Dow Jones Industrial Average faces resistance at the 200-day moving average. The Dow rose 0.6% Monday.


The S&P 500 climbed 0.7%. Small caps performed well, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%.


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq. It's always preferable when index gains happen on higher volume. But it was almost impossible for the stock market to beat the heavy volume totals from Friday — a quadruple witching day of options and futures expirations. Still, it was the 15th consecutive day of above-average volume on the Nasdaq.


IBD 50 Beating The Stock Market
-------------------------------


The IBD 50's 15.2% year-to-date gain beats the major indexes. The IBD 50 has been keeping abreast of the Nasdaq this year, but now is beating the composite's 14.1% increase. The S&P 500 is down 3.5%.


Investors using the IBD 50 to pick stocks should be doing even better, with a number of components off to solid runs post bear market. **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) are just a few of those.



IBD 50 stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) broke out of a five-week base Monday, clearing the 459.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But volume was meek, and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) has not caught up to the stock price.


A few breakouts in health care also stood out, even if not part of the IBD 50.


**Corcept Therapeutics** ([CORT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CORT)) gapped up as it broke out of a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in about triple the usual volume. Corcept, which was [discussed Friday in Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/stocks-to-watch-top-biotech-stock-corcept-therapeutics-near-buy-point-offers-big-growth-potential/), was the most impressive breakout in the sector, if not the whole market.


[IBD Live on Monday](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) noted that Corcept's average dollar volume is thin; liquidity risk is less when a stock trades on average $25 million in dollar volume or more.


**Teladoc** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) broke out past a 203.95 buy point of a cup base. But the breakout had the same deficiencies as Netflix; turnover came in 13% below its 50-day average. Sleep apnea respirator maker **ResMed** ([RMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RMD)) rose to a new high at 180.14; its [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was at 172.16.


**Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** ([ALNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALNY)) topped the 151.94 buy point of cup base in robust volume that showed a 52% increase vs the stock's 50-day average. **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) announced on Friday positive trial results for fitusiran, a drug for hemophilia that uses Alnylam technology.


Stock Market Heeding Headlines
------------------------------


The market remains sensitive to headlines on coronavirus. If Covid-19 is making a comeback, investors are doing some hedging already. The price of gold rose to the highest price since October 2012. Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.8% to $1,759.30 an ounce. Economic uncertainty due to Covid-19 and expectations for low interest rates are fueling gold prices.


SPDR Gold ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) rose nearly 0.7% after finding support at the 50-day moving average last week.

The stock market dived Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump offered a dire outlook over the coming weeks for the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq crumbled as much as 5.2% before slightly paring losses to close 4.4% lower.




The S&P 500 stumbled 4.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 4.4%, or 973 points. Leading growth stocks fell sharply: [The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) lost 4.35%. Volume on both main exchanges was mixed vs. Tuesday's session. NYSE volume rose, while Nasdaq volume fell. The small-cap Russell 2000 plunged 7%.


Stock Market Rally Stumbles, After Trump Offers Dire Outlook
------------------------------------------------------------


With the stock market correction over one month in duration (IBD changed its market outlook Feb. 25), investors should still be waiting patiently for the next confirmed uptrend signal — a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). A big drop below the March 23 lows would end the current rally attempt. For now, the follow-through can still happen any day.


On Monday, the Nasdaq's sharp gains nearly confirmed a new uptrend, but volume was barely lower than the previous session.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP040120-274x300.jpg)The coronavirus outbreak continues to spread rapidly in the U.S., with confirmed cases topping 211,000, along with 4,713 deaths by Wednesday, according to [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) data tracker. New York continues to be the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., with more than 83,000 total cases, or about 40% of the country's total. Meanwhile, global Covid-19 cases topped 927,000 with over 46,000 deaths.


Late Tuesday, President Trump offers a [grim outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-trump-coronavirus-stock-market-correction-amazon-microsoft-netflix/) for the coming weeks, saying the country is facing a "very, very painful two weeks."

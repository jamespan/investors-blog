Stock market bulls and bears alike found neither direction nor energy Friday, as the indexes headed toward a three-day holiday.




The Nasdaq lost 0.1%, while the large-cap S&P 500 gained 0.1%. Blue chips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average clung to a 0.2% gain. Small caps tracked in the Russell 2000 faded to a 0.1% loss.


Volume was down on the Nasdaq, and early data showed volume lower on the NYSE. The U.S. exchanges are closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.


August proved to be a difficult month for the bulls, especially growth investors. Of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks, the top five performers for the month told the story.


August Leaders
--------------


The gold miner group led, up 15% for the month. A dart thrower could've done pretty well taking aim at the group. According to preliminary data, **AngloGold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) popped 34% in August; **Pan American Silver** ([PAAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAAS)), 21%; **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)), 20%; **Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), 19%; **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), 18%; **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)), 17%; and **Seabridge Gold** ([SA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SA)), 16%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP083019-237x300.jpg)Kirkland Lake Gold has been No. 1 on the IBD 50 list published in IBD Weekly for more than three months. But even before that, Kirkland was on IBD's radar.


On Dec. 6, IBD reported the stock was setting up for a possible breakout past 23.96. The stock broke out Dec. 11 in heavy volume and is now extended 103% from the buy point.


Stock Market Additional Leaders
-------------------------------


Other groups that led in August included major discount retailers, up 8%; homebuilders, up 7%; soft drinks, up 7%; and water utilities, up 6%.


This isn't the kind of lineup that dazzles. There's a streak of pessimism inherent to gold. Beverages, discount retailers and water utilities have a defensive reputation.


The past two sessions have given aggressive growth investors some hope. On Thursday, China said it would not retaliate against President Donald Trump's most recent tariff plan. On Friday, China waived a 10% auto tax on **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).


Trump's latest round of tariffs was expected to be implemented Sunday. Bulls are hoping China and the U.S. alike will come to an agreement sooner rather than later. Many companies have noted on earnings calls that tariffs are taking a toll.


Precedent In August 1998
------------------------


Investors looking for a precedent to the Nasdaq's current chart might want to look at August 1998. The dance below the 50-day line but above the 200-day line looks similar. How did it end? The Nasdaq pierced the 200-day line and then pegged a low in October. From there, the Nasdaq enjoyed a big run to a high in February.

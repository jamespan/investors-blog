  Stocks Rise Modestly As Financials Continue To Surge

The stock market rose modestly Tuesday as it kept shaking off last week's weakness.


The Nasdaq added nearly 0.5% as the composite continued rising from the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% and is less than 1% from a new high. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq got the worst of last week's slump because bears took their pitchforks directly to technology stocks, so the Nasdaq has more catching up to do.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE.


So far, this week's recovery has been insufficient to dislodge the market from its uncertain direction, so IBD's [market outlook](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) remains at "uptrend under pressure."


![mp120616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MP120616-178x300.png)While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are still finding their footing, other indexes are hardly showing any fatigue.


Oddly, it's been the opposite ends of market capitalization — the small caps and Dow megacaps — that are leading the market. The Dow is up 7.7% from its November low, and the Russell is up 17% — a remarkable run for the small-cap benchmark. The index made a record high Tuesday, and the Dow nearly did as well.


The Dow — usually at a performance disadvantage because it's laden with mature companies — has surged largely thanks to its oil and financial components. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is acting like a hot social media stock, up 34% from a 172.52 buy point, with most of that surge occurring after the Nov. 8 election.


By comparison, the Nasdaq is up 5.7% and the S&P 500 is up 6.2% from the November lows.


The fact that two Dow components — **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and Goldman Sachs — are now part of the IBD 50 growth screen gives you an idea of just how powerful the financial rally has been since Donald Trump won the election and Republicans kept control of Congress.


On Tuesday, some 130 regional and superregional banks made 52-week highs, in addition to 52 major banks, insurers and other financials. Combined, they accounted for about half of all 52-week highs.


More than a half-dozen financials in the IBD 50 already have reached 20% profit targets from their November buy areas. Eighteen of the 50 stocks are financials.


Infrastructure and industrial stocks — another sector that got hot after the election — also followed through. But pharmaceuticals have failed to follow through from the postelection burst. The ethical-drugs group is down 5.8% from its Nov. 10 high. The generic-drugs group is off 4.5% and biotechs are off 7.3% from their Nov. 14 highs.


Indeed, one complaint about the monthlong advance is that there haven't been many new stock opportunities since the first half of November. Investors trying to increase exposure haven't found many secondary buy areas, such as good pullbacks or tight patterns.


**Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) is one of the few new opportunities. It broke out and is in buy range from a 49.07 buy point. The stock is in the IBD 50, which rose 0.4%.


Because the market uptrend is under pressure it's not a great time to be increasing exposure, anyway. And outside the leading sectors there are some breakouts faltering. **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), **Veeva** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Microchip** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are examples, and some are close to sell signals.


There wasn't much economic news Tuesday, but the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index surged to a 10-year high this month. Confidence improved on the presidential election and the subsequent stock market rally.

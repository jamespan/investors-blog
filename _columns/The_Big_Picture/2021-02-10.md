Stock Market Fights Back After Early Downdraft; Tesla Slumps 5%, Gives Up 21-Day Line
======================================================================================

It looked like Wednesday would be rough day for the stock market after a wave of selling hit stocks in morning trade. But the Nasdaq composite was able to shave a 1.2% loss to nearly 0.3% by the close.




Several growth stocks came under selling pressure, but the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks held up relatively well. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eased 0.1%, helped by strength in **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)), **Cerence** ([CRNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRNC)), **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)). The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities EFT ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) more than halved a 4.1% early loss.


Veeva Systems tried to clear a long consolidation with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 314.09. Shares rose 2%, but VEEV stock closed off session highs and below the entry. Nvidia fared a little better. After rising above an early entry Monday, Nvidia hit an all-time Wednesday, rising 3.5%.

On the downside, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) slumped 5% and pierced its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). A break below the 800 level and its Jan. 29 low could pave the way for a test of the 50-day moving average. Nvidia and Tesla are both [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq got turned away at the 14,000 level early but closed nicely off lows. Resistance at 14,000 came as the index bumped up against an upper channel line. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.7%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, resulting in a mild [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the composite. It's the sole distribution day currently for the Nasdaq.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by fewer than 2-to-1. NYSE gainers outnumbered advancers by a small margin.


The Nasdaq didn't have any problems moving above the 13,000 level in January, but it had plenty of problems moving above the 12,000 level in the second half of last year. The Nasdaq got turned away at 12,000 in early September and then pulled back 13%. It happened again in mid-October, and the Nasdaq pulled back nearly 10%.


The Nasdaq today is extended more than 7% above its 50-day moving average. But with the index still comfortably above its 21-day exponential moving average, the stock market remains in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/).


The distribution-day count in the Market Pulse table is still light. Of the S&P 500's four distribution days, the only one that had the feel of meaningful institutional selling was on Jan. 27. Some were removed recently, either because enough time had passed to make them irrelevant, or because indexes rallied 5% from the closing price of the distribution day.

A tame distribution-day count isn't a problem for the stock market currently. But as noted in this space repeatedly, there are enough yellow flags to give investors pause. Preserving portfolio gains at this point makes more sense than aggressively starting new positions.


Playing offense is tougher now with actionable setups getting harder and harder to find. They're still out there but certainly not as plentiful as in early November.


Signs Of A Top?
---------------


What's easier to find is extended stocks, and leading stocks showing topping action. There's an increasing number of growth stocks that have made powerful gains and are gapping up after already being very extended. Many are more than 100% above their 50-day moving averages.


**MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)) is a good example. After surging more than 140% in nine days, sellers hit MicroStrategy hard, sending shares lower by 23%. It was an unequivocal sell signal for those with a big profit in the stock.



3D printing firm **ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)) is another good example. The stock gapped up and soared nearly 22% on Jan. 19, good for a breakout from a 16.99 buy point. Less than a month later, the stock hit a high of 66.48 on Feb. 9, up nearly 300% from the buy point. ExOne also flashed a sell signal Wednesday, slumping 16.5% in heavy volume.


Excessive euphoria and exhaustion gaps have also been seen in fast movers like **Futu** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)), **EXP World** ([EXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPI)) and **Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)).


Tilray, which is set to merge with **Aphria** ([APHA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APHA)), was a topic of conversation on Reddit's WallStreetBets message board. It's a heavily shorted stock, with about 29% of the stock's float held short.


Tilray stock soared 41% on Tuesday on news of an agreement with Grow Pharma to distribute medical cannabis in the U.K. Shares jumped another 51% Wednesday.


Fed Speech, Oil, Stock Market Sentiment
---------------------------------------


Federal Reserve Chairman gave a speech to the Economic Club of New York on the U.S. labor market. Citing a bleak jobs picture, Powell said policy will need to stay "patiently accommodative."



Oil and gas stocks outperformed again as benchmark crude oil futures close in on $60 a barrel. After soaring 8% last week, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) added nearly 2% to 44.71. It's up another 5% this week and just below a 45.10 buy point.


The Investor's Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a slight bump up in bullish sentiment to 58.6% from 57.8%. It was the second straight week below the 60% level, which is considered excessively bullish.


Before that, bullish sentiment topped 60% for nine straight weeks. Excessively bullish sentiment has been seen near several market tops in the past, including last year, when the bulls were at 61.5% on Sept. 1. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms.

Dow Jones Falls 6th Week In A Row, But These Blue Chips Defy The Correction
============================================================================

The Dow Jones Industrial Average illustrated how blue chips, in general, are slowly joining the black and blue.




Certainly, the Dow Jones industrials held up better amid a fresh round of selling Friday. A 0.3% dip outperformed vs. drops of 0.6% by the S&P 500, 1.4% by the Nasdaq composite, and 1.7% by the Russell 2000.


A 428,000-person lift in April U.S. nonfarm payrolls mildly beat the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), indicating there's no economic slowdown — at least on the jobs front. Some economists concluded that the preliminary Q1 U.S. GDP reading of a 1.4% annualized drop is a fluke. With a stronger economy, then, the Federal Reserve has ample reason to keep ratcheting up the cost of money. Perhaps for these reasons, the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year bond jumped 5 basis points to 3.12%.


In a commentary titled, "The Labor Market Is Unsustainably Hot," Ned Davis, founder of Ned Davis Research, points out "the growth rate of temporary jobs (a leading indicator) has fallen." Also, NFIB hiring plans remain strong, "but they have slowed. I see this as a leading indicator suggesting hiring will slow," Davis added.


"The payroll report this morning was a bit weaker under the surface than the headline appears," Matt Peron, director of research at mutual fund giant Janus Henderson Investors, wrote in an email sent to IBD. "This is probably not a bad thing for equity markets, in that some cooling of strong trends could help calm fears of inflation. That said, it's not yet appearing in wage growth, which is still strong."

Dow Jones Today
---------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MP050622-300x277.jpg)The Dow Jones' 0.2% drop for the week wasn't exactly a gut punch to the 30-stock index. Yet the Dow industrials suffered its sixth straight down week and is not far from tripping below its year-to-date low of 32,272.


At 32,901, the Dow sits nearly 13% off its all-time peak of 36,952.


Take an IBD ratings X-ray of the Dow's 30 blue chip stocks, and remarkably 13 show a Composite Rating of 80 or higher. Six own a 90 or greater, including global energy play **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), pharmaceuticals titan **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and insurance behemoth **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)). The median Composite is 75 — not great, but not terrible.


Meanwhile, a look at the industry groups' action appears to reflect a penchant among investors to put more money into defensive stocks. Heading into Friday's trading, the top 40 industry groups included diversified utility at 19th vs. 38th six weeks ago; tobacco (No. 25 vs. 47th); foreign telecom (29th vs 50th); alcoholic beverages (31st vs 118th); and meat (34th vs. 113th).


In short? Unless you are actively trading strength in the oil and gas sector and defensive areas such as the ones mentioned above, your best bet to avoid losing money on the long side is to not go long. A failed breakout by new IPO **European Wax Center** ([EWCZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWCZ)), which went public at $17 a share, offers yet another example.


The [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) (VIX) appeared as if it were aiming to close at its highest level in 2022. Instead, the VIX reversed for a 3.2% drop to 30.19.

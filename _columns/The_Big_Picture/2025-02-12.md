  Stock Market Highlights Vulnerable Spot In Cyclicals: Why This Veteran Money Manager Focuses On AI Plays

Interest rate-sensitive companies in the stock market? They were slippery like a beginner skater on ice Wednesday. Less sensitive firms? They provided a much more bullish fight.


That's essentially the message the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)Â gave IBD readers after investors received vital, yet not so surprising, data on prices.




U.S. consumer prices rolled 0.5% higher in January vs. the prior month, above the [Econoday consensus forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of a 0.3% rise. Other measures, including core prices, also came in hotter than expected early Wednesday. The news sent a chill through the futures market. At one point, while bondholders sold Treasuries to send yields climbing, the Nasdaq 100 futures slid more than 1%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


But minutes after the regular session of the stock market began, the bulls began to dig in their heels.


The Nasdaq composite turned an early loss of more than 1.2% into a tiny 6-point gain, or up less than 0.1%. More important than the gain, obviously, is the way in which the tech-clad index climbed bullishly off its intraday low and closed close to session highs.


In a strong stock market, you want to see stocks brush off weakness at the start and finish high in the day's range. The explanation does not need a rocket scientist or a quantum computer. This chart move indicates institutions with the real buying power took advantage of the early dip to start new positions or pad existing ones.


Amid that bullish reversal, the Nasdaq closed slightly above its 50-day moving average after spending most of the session below it. In another positive sign for growth leaders, the IBD 50 index outperformed with a 1.1% increase.


Not As Strong A Reversal
------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MP021225-227x300.jpg)In large-cap land, stocks saw a similar trading pattern.


The S&P 500, down 1.1% in the early going, failed to streak into the plus column. But it closed down nearly 0.3% as turnover on the New York Stock Exchange climbed 7% vs. the prior day.


Such a decline in higher volume translates into a fresh [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) for the large-cap index. However, as it was a mild drop, the damage to the current uptrend is understandably less concerning.


Notice on the daily chart how the S&P 500 also refused to pierce 6,000, perhaps a psychological level in the stock market today.


The positive reversal is all the more impressive, considering that the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year government note spiked 10 basis points to 4.63%. At one point, the 10-year note yielded 4.66%. Meanwhile, bond traders are not seeing any real chance of a trim in the fed funds rate (currently at a target range of 4.25%-4.5%) until the September meeting.


Small caps underperformed again. The Russell 2000 gave up 0.9%. Meanwhile, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average sat in the middle of declining stock market averages. The 30-stock index fell 0.5%.


Notably, industrial and cyclical companies fell harder than even the small caps.


Consider the 10 worst performing groups among 197 industries tracked by IBD. Preliminary data showed the transportation equipment group getting pounded 6.3%. Fertilizer companies, which have costly inputs, got slammed for a 3.5% loss. (See the full list of industry performance at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/?_gl=1*v0kgmh*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljk3NDU5MzM4My4xNzM4ODY5Mjc4LjE3Mzg4NjkyNzg.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczOTM5ODUzOC4yMzMuMC4xNzM5Mzk4NTM4LjYwLjAuMA..) under the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.)



Homebuilding, U.S. and Canadian oil and gas exploration, heavy construction, telecom infrastructure and metal product distribution stocks also sold off, losing 2.5% or more. Generally, these companies must borrow heavily to fund operations and growth.


Will Small Caps Continue To Lag?
--------------------------------


Stephanie Link, veteran money manager and chief investment strategist at New York-based Hightower, primarily focuses her research efforts on large-cap growth companies. But she believes there's a place for smaller equities in the current stock market. Why? Even though small-cap firms typically show higher financing burdens vs. cash-rich megacap companies, they also benefit from the fact that the U.S. economy is still running at an above-normal pace.


"If the long-term trend in GDP is 1.5% to 2%, we're still running hot," Link told IBD. "I will take stronger growth in the economy with a little bit of sticky inflation, and the reason is earnings." Link added that even though inflation is running mildly above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2%, "consumers will stay fine" so long as employment and wage growth remain robust.


Hightower serves 144 teams of registered investment advisory firms that together held $166 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30. In December, Hightower acquired NEPC, which handles $1.7 trillion in assets for large institutional funds including pensions and endowments.

Stock Market Theme: Don't Ignore AI
-----------------------------------


Link, who has also worked in active portfolio management positions at Nuveen and CNBC star Jim Cramer's charitable trust, thinks long-term investors should also not count out strong fundamental companies associated with the build out of infrastructure needed to enable artificial intelligence to all aspects of business.


"I think the AI infrastructure stocks are underappreciated, " she said. One point: Link says that among the 11,800 data centers operating globally, 5,400 are based in the U.S. and "we'll need to get to 11,000 in three or four years. DeepSeek or not, you still need data centers."



Link says she's held **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) for nearly four years. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company holds a pristine 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).


The sharp rise in the semiconductor giant's forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio (now at 37 times future 12-month earnings, according to MarketSurge) gives her some cause for concern.


Why? Link's tactic among tech companies is to look for a discount in the stock price. But they cannot simply be any tech firm. A solid track record of sales and earnings, and top-notch management are both critical selection criteria in addition to valuation. Hence, she also picked up shares of **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) after its 40% correction because she concluded the cybersecurity giant is best-in-class in terms of management.


CrowdStrike has acted very well in the stock market lately since clearing a deep first-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 323.94 in the week ended Nov. 8. The stock tacked on a [six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) that began forming in December and revealed a 389 buy point. The megacap tech is up 3% for the week at 434.63 and aiming for a fifth straight up week.


CrowdStrike's [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) has also notched a new high.


"Cybersecurity is directly related to AI, and none of the vendors are talking to each other (in terms of interoperability)," Link said. "AI only introduces companies to more risk. I've interviewed many CTOs, and have learned that spending growth is double digits in AI and cybersecurity."

Nasdaq Up; Why The Sloppy Second-Half Start For Stocks So Far?
===============================================================

Techs and medicals helped the Nasdaq composite stage a decent rebound Wednesday, but the mixed results among major indexes hinted that investors are still not that eager to jump back into stocks.




 While the Nasdaq composite, boosted by a broad rallyÂ in the semiconductor sector, rose nearly 0.7% and halted a three-day losing streak, small caps suffered the worst decline among the key indexes. The S&P SmallCap 600 lost 0.7%. The Russell 2000 fell almost 0.5%, giving back more than half of its 0.8% gain during Monday's half-day session.


The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average ended virtually flat, hurt by weakness in the energy patch and select retail stocks. Auto parts retailers were the worst hit in the stock market, falling 10% on an earnings warning from one of its leaders, **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)).


The drop among auto stocks coincided with the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting on interest rates, showing concern about the state of the automotive industry. "Participants generally continued to expect that ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, and improved household balance sheets would support moderate growth in household spending over the medium term," the minutes wrote. "However, District contacts reported that automobile sales had slowed recently; some contacts expected sales to slow further, while others believed that sales were leveling out."


In other markets, crude oil dropped more than 4%. U.S. government bonds moved little.


Back to U.S. equities, volume grew on both main exchanges vs. Monday, but at least on the Nasdaq, volume was likely below its 50-day average. (See the big daily chart of the Nasdaq via the link at the end of this article to a page showing the major indexes' daily price-and-volume action.)


After the market close on Monday, an influential industry group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, reported a 22.6% jump in global semiconductor sales for May vs. the year-ago period. In the current era of slow global economic growth, such an increase is stunning. No wonder, then, among the day's top 10 industry groups, three came from the chips sector (semiconductor manufacturing, up 2.1%; semiconductor equipment, up 1.9%; and fabless chips, up 1.6%).


When the market rallies, you'd like to see more stocks rising than falling. That wasn't the case on Wednesday. Despite the Nasdaq's decent rise, losers topped winners by roughly a 3-to-2 margin, according to early data. On the NYSE, down-stocks beat up-stocks by almost 2-to-1.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MP07051717-181x300.png)The top 10 groups (see the ones highlighted in blue in the table at the bottom of the market charts page, once again via the PDF link below, or via the entire Industry Sub-Group Rankings at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com) also showed a healthy scoop of computer software and medical groups. These and other industries, in fact, are primarily responsible for the Nasdaq's nice gains since the start of the year.


However, as noted in recent Big Picture columns, distribution has returned to the market in recent weeks, and some of the bouts of professional selling have been unusually intense. Among the six distribution days noted in the Market Pulse table, three of them caused declines of well more than 1% for the Nasdaq composite (-1.8% on June 9; -1.6% on June 27; and -1.4% on June 29).


Given the fast shrinkage in the number of new breakouts and problems with stocks that recently tried to shoot to new highs, it's very sensible now to continue taking a cautious approach in the market. On the other hand, keep watching the Nasdaq as it tries to retake its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and S&P 600 remain above their 50-day lines for now.


The continued threat of a North Korean nuclear bomb may be helping the advance of defense firms, but one has to wonder how it could impact the spending habits of consumers both in the U.S. and in East Asia. On Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark dropped 1.5% and pierced its rising 50-day line. It reclaimed a third of those losses on Wednesday in lower yet above-average turnover.


At 25,521, the Hang Seng is up 16% year to date, much more than the S&P 500's 8.7% gain. With a large number of Chinese-bred internet and consumer-oriented firms in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), it's important to view the overall health of Chinese equities via the Hang Seng.


Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June 13-14 meeting, which came out around 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, appeared to show little change in bankers' thinking on balance-sheet assets and inflation. While the members of the Fed's interest rate policy committee see continued improvement in jobs, spending and business investment, they are still showing concern about the path of inflation.


There also appeared to be no fresh detail on how the U.S. central bank will take specific steps in reducing the bond and mortgage-backed security assets on its bloated balance sheet, said to be around $4.5 trillion.


Chris Gaffney, head of world markets at EverBank, noted that, based on the minutes, some Fed members wanted to announce the start of balance-sheet trimming within a couple of months while others preferred the end of 2017.


"The markets continue to price in both a rate increase and balance-sheet reduction by the end of 2017; but the question remains on which comes first," Gaffney said. "Investors are now betting that we will get balance-sheet reduction beginning in August and the rate increase postponed to the December FOMC meeting."


Indeed, traders will be watching to see if the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year government bond, currently around 2.33% and up nearly 100 basis points from the July 2016 low, eclipses its recent May peak of 2.42%. If it does, it may provide an opportunity for banking firms to reap bigger profit margins on their interest-rate-sensitive lines of business.


Meanwhile, the latest readings on the CME FedWatch futures analysis indicate only a 20.6% chance that the Fed will push the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans to a target range of 1.25%-1.5% at its Nov. 1 meeting. Yet the probabilities of at least a 1.5% fed funds rate rises to 57.5% by the final FOMC meeting of the year on Dec. 13.

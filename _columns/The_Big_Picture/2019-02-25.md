New signs that the U.S. and China are closer to a trade agreement sent stocks higher, but the early gains faded and left the S&P 500 today with a minor symptom of institutional selling.




The S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.7% in the first couple of hours of the session Monday. But the market started giving back gains around midday and into the afternoon, leaving the S&P 500 near session lows, up only 0.1%.


The Nasdaq faded from a 1% early gain to close just 0.4% higher and also around session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also retreated, ending with a 0.2% gain.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq but rose on the NYSE. The higher volume on the NYSE resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500. In this case, the heavy institutional selling [came in the form of stalling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/). Certainly, stalling days are not as serious as big index losses in heavy volume, but they must still be taken into account in the market analysis.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MP3x1_022519-238x300.jpg)The S&P 500's three distribution days in the past few weeks are nowhere close to an alarming rate. Indexes normally endure twice as many distribution days or more before they top in a significant way.


The Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.1%.


The S&P 500, Nasdaq Are Due For A Break
---------------------------------------


If the market goes down from here, it won't be from distribution but from, metaphorically, the law of gravity.


The Nasdaq has gone up nine weeks in a row and the Dow and S&P almost as much. It's hard to imagine the market extending that streak.


Guessing the top, however, isn't smart. A few weeks ago, investors easily could have concluded the market was due for a pullback. Yet, it kept going up.


The current optics on the market show no disruption in the market's upward momentum. Indexes are still in rising price channels. The advance-decline line of the Nasdaq is closer to a new high than the index itself. The NYSE's A/D line is at new highs already, a reflection of the uptrend's good breadth.


Test Of November Highs
----------------------


In the loftier parts of Monday's session, the Nasdaq and Dow rose above their Nov. 7-8 short-term peaks. (The S&P almost reached its Nov. 7 peak.) But both indexes closed slightly below those highs.


That was noteworthy in the context of the market's strong ascent, and investors should make a note to watch that level in the short term. Often, the market's recovery is slower than its decline. But the two-month rebound so far is going at a better trajectory than the October-to-December decline.


For weeks, the stock market has been rising largely on hopes that the U.S. and China would reach an agreement on trade issues. Those hopes seem to be crystallizing with the latest headlines.


Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said he is [delaying new tariffs on Chinese imports](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/25/stock-market-investors-focus-on-us-china-trade-talks.html) because of progress in negotiations. The tariffs were set to go into effect March 1. On Monday, he tweeted that [negotiations are in "advanced stages."](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100126391729774592)


Chinese stocks rallied on the news. In China, the Shanghai composite soared 5.6% and the Shenzhen index rallied 5.4%. The iShares China Large Cap ETF ([FXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FXI)) rose 2% to the highest level since mid-June.


U.S. Stocks Lag China's
-----------------------


But while U.S. stocks started off well, gains faded through the session. Even Trump's "advanced stages" tweet failed to bring new buyers in the afternoon. Perhaps it was a case of selling on the news, as U.S. and Chinese negotiators continue talks and those discussions reach higher-level officials.


[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) rose less than 0.2%. The IBD 50 is further from new highs than the major indexes, about 14% from its 52-week high, while the big indexes are 3% to 6% away. Of course, the IBD 50 fell a lot more than the indexes, nearly 34%.


There were a few good breakouts Monday. **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)) rose above the 61.07 buy point of a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Volume was double its usual pace, and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/) made a new high — two good signs. The fintech stock was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


U.S. crude oil fell 3.5% to $55.24 a barrel after Trump complained on his Twitter account, "Oil prices getting too high," and urged OPEC to "relax and take it easy." Exploration and production, pipeline and drilling industry groups were lower. Coal, solar and alternative-energy groups also were weaker.

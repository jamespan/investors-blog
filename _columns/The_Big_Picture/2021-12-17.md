Stock Market Falls, But Health Care Stocks Lift Russell 2000 To Big Gain; Watch These Networking Stocks
========================================================================================================

Small caps outperformed the stock market Friday, and the Nasdaq composite held up relatively well, but a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 cast a pall on the market uptrend.




Selling was most pronounced in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which slumped 1.5% and closed below its 50-day moving average. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) took the biggest hit in the Dow, down nearly 4%, while **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) gave back 2.3%. Financial stocks outperformed during Thursday's sell-off. But after rising 1.3% Thursday, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) slumped just over 2% Friday.


Meanwhile, a big breakout in the financial sector Thursday fell apart Friday. Small cap **Customers Bancorp** ([CUBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUBI)) vaulted over a 61.58 buy point Thursday, rising 8%, but shares crashed more than 12% Friday.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The S&P 500 fell 1%, ending the week just above its 50-day line. Volume rose on the S&P 500 as options and futures expired, giving the benchmark index a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) — not a good sign for the uptrend so soon after Wednesday's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MP121721-296x300.jpg)The Nasdaq composite fell 1.4% early but pared its loss to less than 0.1% by the close. But the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fell 0.5% and closed below its 50-day line for the first time since mid-October. The weak close for the Nasdaq 100, along with a distribution day for the S&P 500, is enough to put the [stock market uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/).


If you've been raising cash in recent days, that's a good thing. The risk level is still elevated at this point and there's no need to rush back into the market. Watching from the sidelines makes perfect sense until new setups present themselves. It's very difficult navigating a whipsaw market.

Money flowed into bonds early, sending the 10-year Treasury yield lower by 5 basis points to 1.37%. But the yield recovered to 1.4% by the close.


The big question on a lot of investors' minds these days is why the 10-year yield hasn't been rising more in light of an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve. On Wednesday, the majority of Federal Open Market Committee members signaled three rate hikes in the cards for next year. That would bring the Federal funds rate to a range of 0.75% to 1%.


There are several interpretations as to why the 10-year yield can't get out of its own way. A big one is that the bond market is worried about what the U.S. economy might look like in the second half of next year, especially if the delta and omicron variants continue to spread and inflation stays stubbornly high. That's a recipe for slower growth.


Small Caps Outperform
---------------------


Weakness in financial stocks didn't have much impact on the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which rose 1%. The index was boosted by another day of outperformance from health care stocks, the highest-weighted sector in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) at nearly 18%. Financial services stocks make up nearly 15% of the index.


Health care stocks continue to outperform across a variety of sub-groups. After six straight gains, **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) gave back nearly 3% but still showed an inside day by the close. **West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)) had a good week, up 4% as it trades just below a 458.09 buy point. **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) is still in buy range from a 120.89 entry.



Oil and gas stocks led the downside in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com). Homebuilders also lagged, but real estate investment trust **Invitation Homes** ([INVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVH)) is holding gains nicely and near highs after a breakout; so is **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)), tracked in IBD's data storage group.


Networking Strength
-------------------


Meanwhile, IBD's networking group has also been a pillar of strength amid a recent sell-off in software stocks.


Dow component **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) has moved nicely higher after an earnings sell-off. Recent up days have been fueled by strong volume as the stock trades near a 58.73 entry after a breakout from a double-bottom base. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) bounced back after Thursday's sell-off. The stock surged past a 134.24 entry. **Extreme Networks** ([EXTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXTR)) is another strong performer in the group.


Meanwhile, sector ETFs like the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLRE)), the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLV)) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLB)) continue to show relative strength.

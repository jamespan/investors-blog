U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range most of Thursday but perked up in the final 15 minutes of the session.




 The market lingered near the break-even line most of the day, apparently as it waited for more details on President Trump's tariff policy.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rallied to 0.4% gains. The Dow Jones industrial average also added 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 eased less than 0.2%, after outperforming the other indexes earlier in the week.


Volume increased on the Nasdaq. According to preliminary data, NYSE volume fell.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP030818-231x300.png)The Nasdaq hasn't seriously tested resistance at the 7500 level since late January, while the S&P 500 has found resistance at its 50-day moving average.


Trump's stance on tariffs has hurt the stock market's efforts to make a run at those resistance levels.


On Thursday, Trump convened a meeting at 3:30 p.m. ET at the White House, and announced that he would sign orders to slap tariffs on imported steel, while exempting Canada and Mexico from the penalties.


The [exemptions for Canada and Mexico](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/donald-trump-trade-remarks-add-to-confusion-dow-jones-sp-500-fall-as-details-still-in-flux/) were Trump's only concessions, and tariffs on specific nations will be announced later. Countries expected to be hit include China, Brazil, South Korea, Japan, Germany and Turkey.


Congress could vote to retake the tariff powers the U.S. Constitution grants it, but that would take a willingness to fight Trump.


With U.S. policy decided, will that settle the issue and let the stock market rise?


Not necessarily. The problem with going down the tariff path is that it can easily move from one uncertainty to the next. Other countries can come up with their own countermeasures, which inspire further U.S. actions in a vicious cycle.


For the stock market, the best realistic outcome Thursday would've been a policy weak enough that other nations could overlook it.


That isn't exactly what the market received but it could've been worse.


Where does this leave the stock market?


Despite all the negatives noted, the stock market is known for going the opposite way of what logic might suggest.


So, individual investors are best off letting the price and volume action of the stock market guide their decisions. As [E.F. Hutton founder Gerald Loeb](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/why-gerald-loebs-battle-for-investment-survival-rings-true-in-todays-markets/) observed, the market does a better job predicting the news than the news does of predicting the market.

The individual investor does not have to resolve all the uncertainties surrounding Trump and his advisors. The investor only needs to know the market's action.


With the uptrend under pressure, investors are largely in a wait-and-see mode.


On Thursday, a few stocks weren't waiting to break out.


They included **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)), optical inspection systems provider **Orbotech** ([ORBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORBK)), chip equipment maker **Rudolph Technologies** ([RTEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTEC)) and chip designer **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)). After the close, Marvell reported small beats on earnings and revenue. The stock fell 1% in after-hours trade.


Economic Data
-------------


Economic reports Thursday were mixed.


First-time jobless claims rolled in at 231,000, about 5% more than expected. Claims were 210,000 the previous week, which was the fewest since December 1969.


Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a nearly 21% drop in announced job cuts in February at U.S.-based companies.


On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its employment situation report before the market's open. The Street expects nonfarm payrolls to come in at 205,000. The range of estimates runs from 152,000 to 230,000. The jobless rate is expected to edge down from 4.1% to 4%. But the focus will likely be on wage gains.

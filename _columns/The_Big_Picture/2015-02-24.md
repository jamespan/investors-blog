Stocks took comfort in the latest comments from Fed chief Janet Yellen Tuesday, as the Nasdaq continued an unusually long winning streak.

  

With a 0.1% advance, the composite made it 10 up days in a row. That's a long time to go without a single decline, although most of the gains have been small.

  

The S&P 500 added 0.3% to a new record high.

  

The Dow led with a 0.5% rise, as **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) jumped 4% to a new high. The home-improvement retailer gapped up to a new high after its earnings topped expectations. Also, **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) climbed 2.5% and broke out of a cup with handle. The bank said it will shutter 5% of its branches.

  

Yellen's testimony gave the market plenty to parse, so trading picked up across the board.

  

The Federal Reserve chairwoman told a Senate committee it is "unlikely" that rate hikes will come at its next two meetings. That leaves the Fed on track for an earliest possible hike in June. (See [story](http://news.investors.com/economy/022415-740655-yellen-wants-option-of-rate-hikes-any-meeting.htm).)

  

What indexes lacked in percentage gains, they made up for in breadth. Winners topped losers by 8-to-5 on the NYSE and by 4-to-3 on the Nasdaq. Solar, building, semiconductor and cyclical stocks led.

  

Of course, the longer the indexes rise, the sooner a pullback will happen. Some indicators are showing the indexes overbought, and some type of retracement should be expected now.

  

The signs so far don't suggest a barrage of institutional selling is lurking.

  

The number of distribution days is quickly diminishing. On Tuesday, the distribution days of Jan. 27 on the Nasdaq and Jan. 30 on the S&P 500 got deleted from the count because the indexes have climbed substantially from those days.

  

Meanwhile, there hasn't been a distribution day — a significant drop in higher volume — in more than two weeks.

  

A steady diet of breakouts among highly rated stocks is keeping the market uptrend well fed. Most are holding above their buy points.

  

The stream of breakouts continued Tuesday. **Drew Industries** ([DW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DW)), which makes components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes, soared 5% in heavy volume as it cleared a nearly yearlong pattern. The company's Q4 results beat expectations. RV maker **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) has broken out, too.

  

**Cracker Barrel** ([CBRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBRL)) continued a trend of breakouts in restaurant stocks. Quarterly results topped estimates and management raised its full-year outlook.

  

It's been mainly the smaller-cap restaurants that have led the charge, such as **Kona Grill** ([KONA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KONA)), **Fiesta Restaurant Group** ([FRGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRGI)) and **BJ's Restaurants** ([BJRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJRI)).

  

But the most impressive has been big-cap **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)). Shares of the coffee chain are up 6% from 88.22, the closing price on Jan. 23, when the stock gapped up on earnings.

  

The strength in these stocks is part of a larger leadership in the retail and consumer sectors. An improving economy and lower gasoline prices are helping. That's causing a bit of sector rotation, in which techs also are emerging.

  

About a dozen stocks in the IBD 50 are consumer- or retail-related. The IBD 50 rose 0.3% Tuesday.

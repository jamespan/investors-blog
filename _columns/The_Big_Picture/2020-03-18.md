Stock Market Dives Again; Russell 2000 Plunges 10.4%, S&P 500 Triggers Another Circuit Breaker
===============================================================================================

The stock market was hit with another round of relentless selling Wednesday as Wall Street continued to worry about a prolonged economic downturn due to the spreading coronavirus. Major stock indexes moved off lows during the final minutes of trading on news the Senate has the votes to pass an initial coronavirus relief plan to expand paid leave, among other things.




The White House is trying to push through a stimulus package of more than $1 trillion that includes direct payments to Americans and financial relief to small businesses and the airline industry. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warned of 20% unemployment without action.


The Dow Jones plunged 6.3%. The blue-chip index is now below the level from President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. The S&P 500 slumped 5.2%, after triggering the second circuit breaker in three sessions. The Nasdaq composite gave back 4.7%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index plummeted 10.4%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq undercut their lows from Tuesday, killing another rally attempt.


Headed into Wednesday, the S&P 500 had moved 4% or more in either direction for seven consecutive sessions. That topped the previous record of six days from November 1929, according to LPL Financial.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP031820-262x300.jpg)Trading was halted just before 1 p.m. ET when the S&P 500's loss hit 7%. That was around the time the Big 3 automakers — **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Fiat-Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) — announced they were [shuttering operations](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-gm-stock-fall-coronavirus-hits-production/). **Tesla**'s ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) California plant continues to operate despite a legal order to stop.


In the U.S., the [coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) has spread to all 50 states, with 8,304 reported cases. New cases were 1,893 as of 4:45 p.m. ET. Confirmed cases in Italy had been flattening out in recent days, but the country reported 4,207 new cases Wednesday, an acceleration from new cases of around 3,500 in recent days. The death rate in Italy is high at 8.3%, but Italy has an older population that's more vulnerable to the virus.


U.S. crude oil futures hit a 17-year low, settling at $20.37 a barrel, down more than 24%. A sharp drop in oil prices was no help to **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) in the Dow. Shares slumped 22%.


Boeing Dives Again
------------------


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) took another big hit in the [Dow Jones today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/dow-jones-today-dow-stocks-stock-market-news/), down nearly 18% to 101.89. Shares are down more than 60% so far this month as the company faces a cash crunch. Boeing on Tuesday asked for $60 billion in aid for the aerospace industry. The airline industry is seeking $50 billion in aid. IBD's airline group plunged around 25% Wednesday. Nearly half of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD fell 10% or more.


Meanwhile, more coronavirus stock plays emerged. Inside the Dow Jones, **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) outperformed, rising nearly 3%. But it backed off highs after topping a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 125.48.

**General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) held up better than the broad market but still lost 3% after reporting earnings. The stock broke out over a 56.50 buy point Tuesday and is still above the entry.


Grocery chain **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) was one of the top gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), up nearly 3%. Group peer **Grocery Outlet** ([GO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GO)), which debuted in the IBD 50 Top 10 Tuesday, eased 1% to 33.38 after jumping nearly 8%. It's trying to clear a bottoming base with a 36.46 buy point.


**Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) reversed lower after a strong start. It's still toying with a breakout over a 130.65 buy point. Citrix, Wednesday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/citrix-stock-coronavirus-work-from-home/), has been a beneficiary of the coronavirus stock market correction, along with **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)). Both companies enable remote connections.


General Mills and Citrix Systems are in select group of stocks in the MarketSmith Growth 250 whose relative strength lines are at or near new highs. Others include **AMN Healthcare Services** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)), **Flowers Foods** ([FLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLO)), **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)), **Repligen** ([RGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGEN)) and **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)).


It's tempting to buy "story stocks" during a stock market correction, but the best strategy at this point is to sit in cash and wait for signs of a market bottom. IBD changed its outlook to "market in correction" on Feb. 25, one day after the S&P 500 gapped below its 50-day moving average. It turned out to be the right call, and it was a signal for investors to start raising cash and move to the sidelines.


Excessive fear has been seen at market bottoms in the past — and there's no shortage of it now. The put-call ratio clocked in at 1.28 Wednesday. But the ratio has been flashing extreme readings like this for several days now.


The best course of action now is to identify the first day of a new rally attempt. Then look for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) after that. Follow-through days don't always work, but they've been seen at every stock market bottom in the past.


Stock Market Falls, Bonds Fall
------------------------------


Money had been flowing into bonds and out of stocks since Feb. 20, but that narrative has changed in recent days. Since March 9, the 10-year Treasury yield has moved sharply higher, from around 0.5% to its current level of 1.18%. Weak action in both markets means that cash is officially king right now.


Higher interest rates and a slowing economy aren't exactly a match made in heaven, but the Federal Reserve has been doing all it can to keep rates low, including two emergency rate cuts that lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%.


But concerns about a sharp economic slowdown and a very weak corporate earnings environment are real. Deutsche Bank on Wednesday said that U.S. GDP could contract by as much as 13% in Q2. That's on the heels of a Goldman Sachs note Tuesday, which called for a 9% contraction in China's economy for Q1.

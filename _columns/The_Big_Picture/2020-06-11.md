The stock market sold off sharply Thursday on rising coronavirus fears, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite plunged 5.3% to close at session lows.




The S&P 500 plunged 5.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average crumbled 1,861 points, or 6.9% — dragged down by a 16% plunge in shares of **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). The Dow Jones industrials had the worst day since March 16, during the teeth of the coronavirus stock market crash.


Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 suffered a 7.6% fall. Leading growth stocks were also beat down, as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) slid 4.4%. Volume was barely higher on the Nasdaq vs. Wednesday's session and much higher on the NYSE.


A rise in Covid-19 cases in California, Arizona and Texas alarmed health officials and investors, just as more businesses reopen.


Nasdaq, S&P 500 Add Day Of Institutional Selling
------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MP_3x2_061120-240x300.jpg)The Nasdaq's 5.3% dive was its biggest loss also since March 16, when it fell 12.3%. Thursday's action could be viewed as a shot across the bow that could signal the at least temporary halt of a record-breaking streak. Be on the lookout for clusters of distribution days, which are consecutive [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) or several in a short period of time. Often, clustering can quickly cause a shift in the stock market trend.


Thursday's sharp losses came in higher volume than Wednesday, adding a distribution day to both the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The Nasdaq's overall count is two, while the S&P 500 has three distribution days.


Even with just two distribution days on the Nasdaq, investors should be taking preemptive actions with their holdings. You don't have to wait for a change in market trend to start doing some selling. It's never an all-or-nothing decision when it comes to buying and selling stocks. Given the magnitude of the recent run and Thursday's massive losses, taking some profits off the table is prudent. Meanwhile, continue to follow sell signals, like breaks of the 50-day moving average and [the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Stock market leaders also sold off sharply. Chip stocks were among the weaker performers on the day. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) declined 6.1%, while Wednesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) tumbled 8%. AMD stock triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule from a 58.73 buy point in a cup with handle, although the breakout was mild.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) sold off 3.6%, 5.8%, 5.2% and 6.6%, respectively. Even tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stumbled 4.8%.



Stocks To Watch: Amazon, Netflix
--------------------------------


Coronavirus plays **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) were stronger than the major stock indexes amid rising second-wave fears. Amazon stock lost 3.4% but is still holding above a 2,525.55 entry in a three-weeks-tight pattern.


Netflix moved down 2% and is still holding above its key 50-day support level after a strong rebound Tuesday. Netflix stock boasts a highest-possible 99 IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), placing it in the top echelon of growth stocks.

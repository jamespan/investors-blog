Stock Indexes Peg 3rd Gain In A Row, But Here's What's Wrong
=============================================================

U.S. stock indexes seesawed to a solid gain Thursday, notching a third up day in a row, though in progressively lower volume.




The Dow Jones industrial average posted a 1% gain. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.


Small caps coasted as the Russell 2000 added 0.7%.


Volume fell vs. the previous session's pace on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume also fell, according to preliminary data.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP040518-250x300.png)The lower volume has dampened the bulls' hopes. Price gains in falling volume suggest that funds remain cautious.


None of the major indexes has been able to retake the 50-day moving average line. But recent tests at the 200-day line appear to have been successful.


Breakouts
---------


On Thursday, breakouts provided some bright spots and a bit of a Texas theme.


Houston-based tank and barge operator **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) jumped about 5%, clearing a buy point at 81. Volume was heavy.


Midland, Texas-based oil and gas explorer **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) gapped up 4%. The stock crossed above a 26.29 buy point in hefty volume.


Home décor chain **At Home** ([HOME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOME)) advanced 4%. Volume was heavy for the small cap based in Plano, Texas.


Restaurant chain **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) bobbed above and below a 60.53 buy point in subpar volume. The company's Texas link, though, is indirect. The company is based in Louisville, Ky., but has more restaurants in Texas than in any other state.

Some breakouts occurred in companies based outside the lone-star state. Apparel maker **PVH** ([PVH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PVH)) rose nearly 3%. The stock broke past a 158.06 buy point in above-average volume. PVH is based in New York. Its brands include Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.


Industrial distributor **W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)) crept above a 292.57 handle entry in soft volume.


Five of the six stocks have a [Composite Rating](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 90 or better. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is in the top 10%.


Kirby is the stock with the lower rating. The stock's Composite Rating is 82.


On the downside, chip equipment makers encountered stiff headwinds. **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)) dropped 3%.  **Coherent** ([COHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COHR)) shook off 2% and remained near 14-month lows. Volume was below average for both stocks as well as for most others in the chip-equipment space.


Time To Negotiate On Tariffs
----------------------------


Fears of a trade war with China lingered, but market watchers apparently decided that time makes a deal possible. The U.S. must go through a public-comment period before the tariffs can be implemented. That process could take weeks, [the Associated Press reported](http://www.leadertelegram.com/News/Daily-Updates/2018/04/05/div-class-libPageBodyLinebreak-U-S-China-threaten-tariffs-as-fears-rise-div.html).


Meanwhile, China has vowed to counter the U.S. moves, but Beijing has not said when the tariffs for 106 U.S. products would go into effect.


These two factors add up to an opening to get things settled without a trade war.


Coming Up Friday
----------------


The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report will be released before the market's open. Payrolls will rise 175,000, according to the consensus view. The range of estimates runs from 112,000 to 225,000.

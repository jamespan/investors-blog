Stocks Finish Near Break-Even, But Breakouts Keep Coming

Stocks wrestled with the break-even line Thursday, finally settling for a virtually flat close.


The Nasdaq lost less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 gained less than 0.1%.


The IBD 50, which outperformed the major indexes in the previous four sessions, rose 0.1%.


Volume came in higher on both major exchanges.


The action on the S&P 500 met the technical definition of stalling, which is a form of distribution on an up day.


In practical terms, the new distribution has little effect, merely bringing the S&P 500 even with the Nasdaq on the distribution-day count.


Bulls have watched the S&P 500 move mostly sideways in recent weeks. The uptrend has been under pressure now for more than two weeks. However, there have been positive developments in recent sessions.


Breakouts among stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or better were reduced to a handful or two early this month. Since mid-month, the pace has picked up.


Even better, the breakouts represent a broadening of the uptrend. Not long ago, the oil and medical sectors owned the uptrend. Recently, retail, apparel, computer and Internet stocks have joined the party, though this party so far seems rather quiet.


On Thursday, breakouts included apparel marketer **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), up 15% in volume 401% above average; paper and packaging maker **Graphic Packaging** ([GPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPK)), up 7% in 74% faster turnover; and retailer **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), up 2% in volume 106% above average.


Starbucks topped the Street's estimates on earnings and revenue, but the stock slipped after hours.


Other leaders nailed down good gains in the regular session, and here again the sectors showed variety. The Market Pulse below includes gainers from the Internet, transportation and finance sectors and more.


Many recent gains are occurring in the wake of strong Q2 results, which at least for now has taken the spotlight away from the troubled international scene. Friday will be a thin day for companies reporting quarterly results, but that provides market watchers with another test to watch.


Individual investors should track recent breakouts to see how strong or weak the follow-up action is. Even if an investor doesn't own the stocks, post-breakout action is a clue to market strength or weakness.


Economic news was mixed Thursday.


On the plus side, first-time jobless claims were the fewest since 2006. On the negative side, new-home sales for June slid 8.1% and the May figure was reduced from a 19% increase to an 8% pop.

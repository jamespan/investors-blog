A quiet start for the stock market Monday was far from quiet at the close as the major averages ended with solid gains.


The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.9%. The S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 0.9% and the IBD 50 picked up 1.1%. Volume on the Nasdaq rose from Friday's levels. NYSE volume fell.


On the NYSE, advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by nearly 2-to-1. The ratio was weaker on the Nasdaq, at 15-to-11.


The market shrugged off the latest reading from the closely watched ISM manufacturing index. It dropped to 50.8 in April from 51.8 in March. Economists expected a smaller decline to 51.5. New orders remained the strongest point of the data, registering 55.8. Readings above 50 signal expansion, below 50 contraction.


The good news for manufacturers and corporations is that the dollar has been weakening, which ultimately helps U.S. exports. Late Monday, the U.S. dollar index was trading around 92.50, its lowest level in about 16 months. The euro, meanwhile, rose above $1.15 for the first time since August. The dollar has been weak as Wall Street scales back its rate-hike expectations for the rest of the year.


![MP050216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MP050216-192x300.jpg)The distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 remains high and has been a thorn in the side of growth investors. The stock market can put up with sporadic signs of institutional selling, but seven distribution days for the Nasdaq and six for the S&P 500 make for a difficult environment for growth stocks to succeed.


Institutional-quality names like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) are the exceptions after reporting strong earnings last week. Amazon followed though nicely after Friday's breakout, rising nearly 4%. Facebook is holding gains after its breakout over a 117.09 buy point.


The same can't be said for other Nasdaq 100 bellwethers like **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). All three have been under pressure after reporting earnings.


Year to date, the performance of the Nasdaq composite is nothing to write home about. Through Monday, the index was down 3.8%, lagging a 1.8% gain for the S&P 500.


It makes sense to have some exposure to stocks at this point, but not aggressive exposure. If you're scanning through multiple screens looking for buy opportunities, and they're just not yielding much, listen to the market's message. It's OK to be patient. In healthy markets when it's clear that big money is moving in from the sidelines, new buy opportunities are the rule, not the exception.


Among stocks acting well, **Fortune Brands** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)) is seeking support at its 10-week moving average for the first after a breakout in mid-March.


**TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) has the look of an emerging leader after a March 29 breakout. Shares surged 9% last week, fueled by strong earnings.


Among financials, **Western Alliance Bancorp** ([WAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAL)) is trading tightly just below an all-time high after a breakout above a 34.46 cup-with-handle buy point. Earnings growth has accelerated for three straight quarters. It's also a liquid name with an average daily dollar volume of $31 million.

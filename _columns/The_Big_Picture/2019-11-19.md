Nasdaq, Small Caps Win In Mixed Day; Stock Market Paints This Unique Picture In Q4
===================================================================================

Growth stocks and value stocks moving up in harmony? Come on. That's like asking die-hard Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears football fans to share a long taxi ride and get along blissfully the whole way, right?




But the stock market today is showing a funny mix of bullish colors. So-called growth stocks and value stocks keep hammering out gains in the fourth quarter of 2019.


On Tuesday, stocks ended mixed. But the losses by the S&P 500 (less than 0.1%) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%) proved trivial. Within the 30-stock Dow Jones, **Home Depot**'s ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) 12.99-point skid on [disappointing quarterly sales](https://www.investors.com/news/home-depot-earnings-q3-2019-lowes-earnings/) offset a 3.11-point gain in **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and a rise of at least 1 point by two other components.

While volume edged higher on both main exchanges, the S&P 500's small loss would not qualify as a [fresh distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). The Nasdaq rose 0.2% on Tuesday. The Russell 2000 lifted 0.4%. Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) punched out a 0.7% gain in its ninth up day in a row.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MP111919-178x300.jpg)The distribution day count on the S&P may be double that of the Nasdaq. However, keep in mind that one of those four sessions of intense professional selling came in the form of a [stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) on Nov. 12. That day, the large-cap benchmark actually gained 0.2%. But it finished well within the lower half of the day's trading range after making a new all-time high.


Bull markets do not die of old age, nor do they meet their demise at the hands of stalling days.


Up And Down Performance
-----------------------


Meanwhile, Tuesday's session truly showed mixed tints at the industry group and sector levels.


While biotech, medical and software stocks enjoyed a rosy session, many of their retail counterparts did not. On Monday, [medical stocks dominated the new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-18-2019/) of stocks marking 52-week or all-time peaks. [No. 1 in the IBD 50, lately](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)? For a long time, it used to be a gold miner. Now, it's cosmetic surgical systems innovator **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)), [discussed nearly every day on IBDLive](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=icmhpbrdcstmsg|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|707596&src=A00387A) over the past week.


Just one look at **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) and its 19% plunge in heavy turnover is all the information you need to surmise that numerous retailing shares fell in sympathy.


A preliminary look at the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD points to heavy selling in department store, consumer electronics, home furnishings, apparel and shoe, discount and variety, office supply, and specialty retailing stocks. All of these groups fell 1.4% or more. (Check the final tallies at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), then click on "Industry Group Rankings.")


Lately, you probably don't see or hear many news headlines trumpeting the notion that "value" has overtaken "growth" in U.S. equities. It seemed all the rage during the summer. Truth is, though, both types of stocks are actually doing pretty well.


For instance, Ned Davis Research noted that the Invesco Pure Growth and Pure Value ETFs "both made all-time new highs on a total return basis." Go to page A12 in the current issue of IBD Weekly, and you'll see the Growth Funds Vs. Value Funds graph showing an upward tilt since early October. However, that line has a long way to go to hit the near-term August peak; in September, value funds torched growth.


Stock Market Today: What Does The S&P 500 Show?
-----------------------------------------------


Looking at the companies within the S&P 500 (there are more than 500, by the way, due in part to dual-class shares in companies such as Fox and Google owner Alphabet), the average price-to-earnings ratio on a trailing 12-month basis is 22, according to data from IBD sister company William O'Neil + Co. Of course, that 22 ratio stands in the upper end of the historical spectrum.


So, naturally you could find a somewhat meaningful number of companies that are faring well amid a broad market advance, yet still show a lower than P-E ratio of 22, and hence are considered "value" stocks.



[Within the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full), **NMI** ([NMIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NMIH)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), **Spirit Realty** ([SRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SRC)) and **Leidos** ([LDOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LDOS)) all show P-E ratios lower than the S&P 500. Obviously, low interest rates have helped most of these leading stocks. On Tuesday, the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note yielded a still paltry 1.79%.


What's more important for growth stock investors, however, than trying to decide between growth and value? Earnings.


If you considered market value as a measure of performance instead of P-E ratios, then it's clear that profit growth is making a strong impact on the makeup of the S&P 500. The average [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) among the top 50 companies in terms of market cap (share price times total diluted shares outstanding) of 75 truly eclipses the 59 average [Earnings Per Share score](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) among the bottom 50.


So forget about growth vs. value.


Bigger is better — that is, bigger earnings.

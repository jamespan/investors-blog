Stock Market Succumbs To Late Selling Again Ahead Of Inflation Data, Fed Minutes, Retail Sales
===============================================================================================

The stock market faced another round of selling Tuesday ahead of a busy week of inflation data and the release of the minutes from the Sept. 20-21 Federal Reserve meeting.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.4% intraday, helped by strong showings from **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN))Â and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)).


But the blue-chip index started to fade badly around 2:45 p.m. ET and ended with a gain of just 0.1%. Amgen closed off highs but still rose nearly 6%, helped by a [positive note from Morgan Stanley](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amgen-stock-the-big-name-you-need-to-know-in-the-multibillion-dollar-obesity-treatment-realm/). AMGN stock showed bullish action by gapping above its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.

Sellers dictated the action again Tuesday as the stock market remained in the throes of a correction. At some point, new institutional money will start to come in from the sidelines again. But until that happens, it doesn't make sense trying to make money on the long side when the market tide is flowing decidedly negative.


Since the Dow is still holding above its Sept. 30 low, Tuesday marked the seventh day of a rally attempt for the index, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still looking for the first day of their rally attempts. The S&P undercut its Sept. 30 low with Tuesday's loss.


[Follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-identify-stock-market-bottoms-use-this-key-signal/) tend to happen when they're least expected, so it's important to recognize when one occurs. Just keep in mind that the best follow-through days in the past have always been accompanied by a healthy number of bullish stock charts. But growth stocks with bullish technical setups are the exception, not the rule, these days.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite extended its losing streak to five sessions, falling 1.1%. Four straight closes near session lows brings the possibility of a trip down to the 10,000 level into play. It's a key support level to watch, especially since it's pretty close to the Nasdaq's breakout area in June 2020.


Chip-equipment stocks bore the brunt of the selling again in the stock market, with names like **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) down more than 5% each. IBD's chip-equipment group was the day's worst performer, down around 5.5%. For the week, it's already down around 9%.


The S&P 500 gave back nearly 0.7%. The index still has a ways to go to get down to the 3400 level, also a logical support level because it's near the S&P 500's breakout area in August of 2020.

The Russell 2000 small-cap index eked out a gain of less than 0.1%. Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed higher volume on the NYSE. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by less than 2-t0-1.


The down session in the stock market came ahead of the release of the producer price index on Wednesday. The Econoday consensus estimate is for wholesale prices to be up 0.2% compared to August's reading of -0.1%. Year over year, prices are expected to fall slightly to 8.4% from 8.7% in August.


Also on Wednesday, the minutes from the Sept. 20-21 Federal Reserve meeting are due at 2 p.m. ET. The consumer price index is due Thursday, with September retail sales due Friday.


For now, federal funds futures traders think there's an 80% chance of another 75-basis-point hike at the Nov. 1-2 Fed meeting. Traders are still leaning toward a 50-basis-point hike in December. But the odds of a fifth straight 75-basis-point hike, though still low, have been increasing.


Market Movers
-------------


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Cardinal Health** ([CAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAH)) had a fine day, up just over 2%. It's closing in on a 72.38 buy point after surging out of a cup base in August. The gain from the earlier buy point of 64.63 hit nearly 12%. That means the current pattern qualifies as a base-on-base structure.

Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Molina Healthcare** ([MOH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOH)) faded off highs but still rose 0.6%. The health insurer was featured as Monday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/moh-stock-why-it-is-not-a-good-time-to-buy-this-ibd-stock-of-the-day-yet/) pick as it forms a flat base with a 361.35 entry.


After an orderly pullback, **World Wrestling Entertainment** ([WWE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWE)) reclaimed a 75.33 entry early in the session, but the stock closed off highs and slightly below the buy point. Volume was heavy.


After two straight weekly closes near its 10-week line, **Elf Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) is making a good case for support at the line this week. Shares jumped 6% Tuesday after Piper Sandler upgraded the retailer to overweight from neutral and raised its price target to 46 from 35. Support at the 10-week line comes after ELF soared out of a deep cup base in early August.

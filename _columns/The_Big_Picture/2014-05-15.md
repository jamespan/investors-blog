Bears Slam Stocks Early, But Bulls Erase Part Of Loss

Bears took control Thursday morning but lost part of their grip as the indexes bounced off their lows.


The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.9%. The IBD 50 carved off 1.1%.


Volume rose sharply, a clear footprint of institutional selling.


However, that footprint didn't look as big at the end of the day as it did in the morning. The Nasdaq fell as much as 1.6% by noon and then erased half the loss. The S&P 500 dived 1.4% by noon and then trimmed a third of the loss.


Apparently, bulls came out in the afternoon, deciding it was time to do some discount shopping.


With the market in correction, individual investors shouldn't play the discount game. Buying on dips can be a trap, and it's best to let the market confirm a new uptrend before risking capital.


The S&P 500 added another page to its tale of persistent support. While the index violated its 50-day moving average in the morning, it retook the line in the afternoon. The Nasdaq, which lately has been the weaker performer, approached its 200-day line but reversed higher before touching it.


However, the small-cap S&P 600 revealed where the risk in this market is centered. The index punctured its 200-day line and closed below it for the first time since November 2012. This suggests a low appetite for risk in the market.


Meanwhile, the Market Pulse is nearing a negative signpost. On Thursday, the Pulse tied two other pullbacks for the longest time wearing the correction label since the 2009 start of the bull market.


Twice in 2012, the Pulse stayed in correction mode for 29 sessions, which the current Pulse matched Thursday. If the condition remains the same Friday, it will be the longest time in that mode since May-July 2008.


A statistic like that has no special meaning by itself, but it underlines the market's weakness.


Yet, some things remain intact. The market has not undercut recent lows and technically is still attempting to rally. A follow-through day could come any time.


Stubborn bulls might find a thread of hope in the put-call volume ratio. A fear gauge, it closed at 1.02 Thursday. The last time it closed higher was a 1.15 reading April 11 â€” marking a short-term low for the S&P 500 and two sessions before the Nasdaq's low.


The put-call ratio is a contrarian gauge. When it's working, high readings foreshadow a market about to rally. The ratio, though, is a secondary gauge, which means its reliability as a bottoming signal is less than that of follow-throughs.


Economic news was mixed. Jobless claims and several factory surveys had a bullish tint. Industrial production and a survey of homebuilders were disappointing.

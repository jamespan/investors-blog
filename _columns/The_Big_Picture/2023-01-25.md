Stocks Shake Off Big Early Losses As This Nasdaq Index Rises; Is A Global Rally Underway?
==========================================================================================

The stock market's January rally is showing resilience. And it just isn't the U.S. market. Plus, the Nasdaq declined but one could also argue that the result was not as bad as one might think.




No doubt, the Nasdaq composite's nearly 0.2% drop, by itself, hardly dents the budding uptrend in place since a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on [Jan. 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-higher-in-first-rally-of-2023-these-groups-fare-best/).


Out of a total six down days since the start of 2023, Wednesday's drop marks the smallest single-day slide. The index was down more than 2% early in the day before it made its rebound.


Concentrate on the megacap techs, and the Nasdaq 100 fell only slightly more than 0.2%. That's encouraging, especially given the brutal decline of 2022. But an equal-weighted view of the Nasdaq on Wednesday proved even more positive.


Nasdaq Today: Beyond QQQ
------------------------


The Direxion Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) exchange traded fund only trades 122,000 shares a day on average. Yet this ETF actually edged up less than 0.1%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MP012523-228x300.jpg)At 68.65, QQQE stands up 7.5% since Jan. 1.


And that gain shines quite well in comparison with other broad measures of U.S. stocks.


The S&P 500 edged less than 1 point lower to 4016, resulting in a 4.6% gain year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up less than 10 points. At 33,743, it's notched merely a 1.8% rise over the same time frame.


Yet the real winners so far, at least domestically, appear to be in "smid-cap land." The S&P SmallCap 600 rose almost 0.3%, extending its advance since Jan. 1 to 6.7%. That's slightly less than QQQE's gain for sure. Yet go back to Jan. 1, 2022, and the S&P 600's 11.9% pullback sharply beats a 19.5% drop for QQQE. The Nasdaq composite has dropped 27.7%.


SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) erased an early 1.2% dip to move almost 0.3% higher Wednesday.


Also, iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) rose 0.3% on Wednesday for its third gain in four sessions. The popular ETF boasts a gain of almost 7.5% since Jan. 1, neck in neck with QQQE.


Nasdaq volume edged 3% lower vs. Tuesday. On the NYSE, composite volume totaled 3.72 billion shares, up 12% from 3.32 billion a day earlier, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged down less than 1 basis point to 3.46%.


The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by just a quarter point at its first policy meeting of the year next week, to be held on Jan. 31-Feb. 1.

Megacaps In 2023
----------------


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), meanwhile, repeated an important refrain for all IBD readers: What you see in the post-session or in the pre-session does not reflect the true balance between supply and demand.


The business software, cloud computing and video gaming titan saw wild trading after Tuesday's regular market close. An early 5% after-hours gain shrank to a minor loss when [Microsoft CFO Amy Hood issued disappointing sales guidance for the fiscal year](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/msft-stock-microsoft-cloud-services-fuel-earnings-beat/) that ends in June. Before Wednesday's regular session open, MSFT dropped as much as 3%. For a megacap growth stock, that's a volatile ride.



Yet look at a daily chart and Microsoft's 0.6% dip for the day did not really change the overall complexion of the stock.


MSFT continues to hold above its November low of 213. Yet it continues to struggle to regain its 50-day moving average. The [200-day moving average's downward slant](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) reaffirms that the Nasdaq-listed megacap is not a leader right now.


No doubt, more big-cap techs and non-tech firms could impact the major indexes later this week and during the next few weeks. So too, will Friday's report on the monthly price consumption expenditures index, a favorite inflation gauge of the Federal Reserve.


To find the new leaders, it's time to use IBD screens and accept the results for what they are. This means checking the [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) table, seeing what is making waves inside [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), and surveying the leading sectors within the [daily New Highs list in IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) â€” just to name a few lists.

International Stocks Today
--------------------------



Outside the U.S., most equity indexes also took a pummeling in 2022. The reasons were pretty much the same: inflation had raged and central banks sought to fight these fires with big interest-rate hikes. Yet so far in 2023, the mood to buy stocks seems to have improved greatly.


Across the Atlantic, iShares MSCI Germany ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)) has marked one of the strongest rallies in recent months. The exchange traded fund, up 0.7% for the day, holds a 13.3% gain since Jan. 1. From its low in September, EWG has leapt 44%, beating the pants off the Nasdaq.


Across the Pacific, East Asian bourses showed solid gains overnight. The Shanghai Composite finished Wednesday's trade up 5.7% since Jan. 1, mildly above a 5% bulge for Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark. South Korea's KOSPI index has coasted 8.6% higher. Yet curiously, India's key S&P BSE Sensex index holds only a 1% gain.


On Wednesday, the Eurozone Flash PMI index, a measure of manufacturing activity, noted a surprising return to expansion in the region's factories in January. The composite PMI index rose to 50.2 following a 0.9-point gain in the services index to 50.7 and a 1-point rise in the overall manufacturing index to 48.8, which remains in contraction. A 50 score signals neutral activity.


"In particular, Germany's services PMI and France's manufacturing index both experienced larger than anticipated increases and returned to expansion," BCA Research noted in a report sent to IBD.


Finally, iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)) eked out a tiny gain on Wednesday, good for its 13th gain in 16 sessions. At 42.10, EEM has rolled ahead 11% in January alone so far.

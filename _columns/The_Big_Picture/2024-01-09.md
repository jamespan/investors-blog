The stock market showed grit to battle back from lows even if there was a negative skew to Tuesday's action. But it was a rewarding day for holders of stock market leaders and growth stocks.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day with a slender gain of 0.1%, a moral victory after it rallied out of the red. Bulls will point to the fact it held above the 10-day line and the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) as positives. The tech-heavy index is holding a solid gain of 2.3% so far this week.


In contrast the S&P 500 ended the day down nearly 0.2% despite closing comfortably off session lows. The benchmark index remains up more than 1% this week and sits a hair above its 10-day moving average.


It was a lower-volume session on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. Decliners outnumbered advancers by more than 2-1 on the NYSE and nearly 2-1 on the Nasdaq.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off lows but still fell 0.4%. While component **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was again among the worst performers, it was **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Dow Inc.** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) that lagged the most. **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) led the index with percentage gains. **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) gave the Dow its most points.


Small Caps Slapped But IBD 50 Excels
------------------------------------


The bears shook down small caps, sending the Russell 2000 1.1% lower. It was a good day for growth stocks though, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rising 0.7%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MP010924-217x300.jpg)The IBD 50 index was helped by noteworthy outperformance among some highflying names. **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) was the top performer as it soared 7.3% in high volume with **GigaCloud Technology** ([GCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GCT)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) following closely behind with lifts of 6.7% and 4.8%, respectively.


Economic data has been somewhat light on the ground so far this week, a calm before the storm because inflation data is due Thursday and Friday. Earnings season is also set to kick off in earnest Friday, when a number of big banks will post quarterly results, including **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)).


Wholesale inventory data is set to be released Wednesday, while New York Fed President John Williams is slated to speak on the economic outlook in the afternoon.


3 Stock Market Groups Shine
---------------------------


A slight majority of the [S&P 500 sectors ended the day in negative territory](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/). Technology and consumer staples, unusual bedfellows, were the best performers while energy and materials lagged.


As ever, the relative performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper insight into the action in the [stock market today.](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/)


Computer hardware plays, security software stocks, coal companies and fiber optics firms were the among the top performers.


In contrast, mail order companies, metal products distributors, steel producers, specialty alloys firms and shipping transportation companies were among the worst laggards.

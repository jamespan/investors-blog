Monday was another ugly session for the stock market, but buyers came in during the last hour of trading, helping the Nasdaq recoup nearly half of a 3% intraday loss.


Make no mistake, though. It was another day of unequivocal distribution -- enough to put IBD's market outlook  back into a correction. The Nasdaq undercut its Aug. 24 low, another bearish sign. After an ugly gap down at the open, the Nasdaq ended near its session high but still lost 1.8%. The S&P 500 finished in the top half of its intraday range but fell 1.4%. The Dow gave up 1.1%. Volume rose from Friday’s above-average levels.


![MP-020916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP-020916-159x300.jpg)A put/call volume ratio of 1.05 Friday and 1.16 Monday points toward a market where fear is on the rise. As the number rises, it means that more bearish put options are being bought than call options. Excessive fear has been seen at many market bottoms in the past.


The Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 fell mostly in line with the main indexes, but massive selling continued in several Nasdaq 100 names, including **Adobe Systems** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Cognizant** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Earnings from Tesla are due Wednesday after the close.


Money continued to flow into bonds as the 10-year Treasury yield caved in 9 basis points to 1.75%. The yield is at its lowest level since January 2015. The precipitous drop in the 10-year yield is the market’s way of saying it has concerns about the health of the U.S. economy.


April gold settled at $1,197.90 an ounce, up $40.20, or 3.5%. It was gold’s highest settle since June.


Gold miners outperformed again. Compelling charts in the group come from the likes of **Agnico Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)) and **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), although both names hardly fit the mold of a classic growth stock.


Despite a modest bounce for the major averages Monday, the selling in former market leaders was once again indiscriminate. Some are falling due to questions about companies' health (see **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), but others are dropping because waves of institutional selling tend to take the very last stock down.


Earnings from **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) were a sight to behold recently, but both names haven’t been immune to the market sell-off.


Favoring liquid, defensive names is good strategy in a down-trending market, but exposure should be limited. Favoring cash makes sense until the selling runs its course. Cutting losses short is critical, too.

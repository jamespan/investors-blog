On days when trading volume simulates melt-on-contact snowflakes rather than a fast-accumulating blizzard, the adept stock market investor focuses even more attention on this key aspect: price action. And Monday's action proved bullish.




Thirty minutes into the regular session, the stock market slipped on some icy economic data.


Consumer confidence in December slid to 104.7, well below the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 113. The Conference Board survey revised its November reading a shade higher, to 112.8 from 111.7. Strong consumer confidence translates to robust spending, giving a boost to the economy overall. Meanwhile, durable goods data offered a mixed picture. The headline number fell 1.1%, a much bigger decline than the 0.2% dip expected.


Stock Market Today
------------------


However, excluding both transport and defense-related equipment, core capital goods orders expanded 0.7%. That smashed the 0.1% growth estimate.


Yet the stock market shook off the numbers, and the Nasdaq composite led the recovery in prices. Down nearly 0.4% in the early going, the tech-enriched index quickly mopped up that minor loss and steadily rose the rest of the session. The Nasdaq closed a sprightly 1% higher and just 8 points off its session high of 19,772.


On [past episodes of IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?_gl=1*1543wax*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2Ljc3NzYwNzQ3OS4xNzM0MzkyNjE0LjE3MzQzOTI2MTQ.*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDk4Njk3Ni4yNC4xLjE3MzQ5ODg1NjQuMi4wLjA.), special guest Mark Minervini, a two-time winner of the U.S. Investing Championships, has often remarked that the key to success in the stock market is a piece of advice veteran trader Bill Berger told him: Don't buy eggs. Buy tennis balls.

Be A Tennis Ball
----------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP122324-248x300.jpg)For two sessions in a row, the Nasdaq decided to act like a bouncy tennis ball, not a cracked egg.


The S&P 500 also showed a bullish intraday bounce.


Down nearly 0.5% at around 10:15 a.m. ET, the large-cap benchmark snapped back like a bull after taking a power nap. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 5,974, coming within 5% of its all-time peak of 6,099.97.


The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) ETF edged up 0.1%. Having fallen 7.7% from its Nov. 29 peak, the exchange traded fund needs to rally a significant amount just to test upside resistance at its [cresting 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


A decent array of industries helped the cause. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, fabless semiconductor, automaker, chip equipment, internet content, airline, home furnishings retail, solar, managed care and ship transport stocks all posted price-weighted gains of 1% or more.


A host of oil-related industry groups also rallied in the 0.7% to 0.9% range, even though crude oil futures on the NYMEX had just a mild gain.



Nonetheless, IBD's industry-specific analysis of the stock market showed numerous areas of egg-like action.


Drugstore, mobile building and RV manufacturing, airfreight, alcoholic beverages, super and mini market and leisure product firms were among the groups that backtracked 1.5% or more. Generally, banking, utility, electrical power and some cyclical stocks sold off. Hence, from this perspective, it's easy to see why the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 lagged. The former gained less than 0.2%; the latter dipped 0.2%.

These Stock Market Indexes Underperform
---------------------------------------


Volume fell rapidly on both main exchanges, as to be expected when Tuesday is scheduled to be only a half-day session ahead of the Christmas holiday. Turnover plunged 56% vs. Friday's trading on the NYSE and shrank 38% on the Nasdaq. The triple-witching expiration of weekly and monthly options and futures boosted Friday's volume.



Notice on a daily chart that the Dow Jones, despite gaining ground a third straight session, has only scraped back a portion of last Wednesday's 2.6% sell-off that followed a strong signal from the Federal Reserve that it's now leaning to fewer trims in the cost of money in 2025. On that day, the U.S. central bank reduced the fed funds rate for the third time this year to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%.


Overall, action in the stock market has been superbly bullish since two key junctures: the Nov. 1, 2023, [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) by the Nasdaq; and bullish action on Nov. 6 this year that IBD described as a "subsequent" follow-through.


Despite Monday's positive action, keep in mind that last week's sell-off was strong enough to lower the recommended exposure in the stock market to 60%-80% from 80%-100%. Plus, [IBD's Market School analysis](https://leaderboard.investors.com/?_gl=1*6zmmgx*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTM0NS40NC4wLjA.#/market/marketschool) currently shows that the [power trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-power-trend/) is under pressure.


While we're now entering the phase where the Santa Claus rally, as coined by Yale Hirsch, founder of the Stock Trader's Almanac, begins on Dec. 24 (or the fifth-to-last trading session of the year), what are some risk factors that investors should be on the lookout for? Here are several to munch on as you consider that second cup of eggnog or extra Christmas cookie.

Risks To The Stock Market
-------------------------


One, small caps sour further. Further drops by smaller issues may indicate that the economy is rapidly contracting, or a credit crunch could be on the horizon. That said, this area of the stock market has advanced. From the Nov. 1, 2023, follow-through day, the Russell 2000 has gained a healthy 47.7%.


Two, market breadth worsens. Keep an eye on the advance-decline lines for the NYSE and the Nasdaq. If the major indexes power to new highs but the A-D lines keep heading south, this divergence usually sets up a serious correction in the future. Meanwhile, [MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF&_gl=1*1r3utpm*_gcl_au*MTM0OTMxNTg3OS4xNzMzODU4NDg2LjY0NTg3ODExLjE3MzM5NDk2ODAuMTczMzk0OTY3OQ..*_ga*MjA3NTg4MzU4OC4xNzM0MDY0MTIz*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTczNDA5OTMyOS4zLjEuMTczNDA5OTMzNi41My4wLjA.) shows that the 10-day average of new lows has now doubled the 10-day average of new highs. Go to "NYEXG" to see a graph of both new highs and new lows.


Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, noted in a Monday comment that "as expectations about the number of cuts in 2025 recently began to come into question, the market returned to favoring a small subset of large technology names that it believes will grow regardless of the economy. The upshot is that every trading day from Dec. 2 through Dec. 19, more individual stocks saw their prices decline than those that rose in price."


"For further context, this is the longest stretch of negative breadth in data going back to 1990," Schutte added. "Despite this, the S&P 500 posted positive performance from Dec. 2 through Dec. 17. It wasn't until the sell-off sparked by the Fed's latest dot plot that the index turned negative."


The 500 edged up a mere 18 points over that Dec. 2 to 17 time frame, yet it was still a gain.

Also, go to the General Market Indicators PDF link at the bottom of each day's Big Picture to analyze the advance-decline lines of both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


Now, even leading stocks can go into corrections and switch into basing modes. That's normal. **Cava** ([CAVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVA)) is clearly working on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/). **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) has undercut its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and might test buyers at its rising 50-day line.


Risk No. 3
----------



Three, emerging markets start to outperform. It's not hard to find a financial advisor publicly touting exposure in non-U.S. equities. In 2024, European equities have been a disappointment. Japan has cooled off. China equities are still trying to bottom out. Some Argentine stocks have been excellent, but only a limited number trade on the U.S. exchanges. So if U.S. companies underperform, it's a little trickier for individual investors to create alpha.


Four, serious distribution smothers the charts. On Monday, the Nov. 15 decline in higher volume on the S&P 500 expired due to time. Thus, it and the Nasdaq currently hold the same number of distribution days on the rolling 25-session count.


Still, the count remains a bit elevated. Plus, the Nasdaq has seen all four of its distribution days cluster over an eight-session period (Dec. 9, Dec. 12, Dec. 17 and Dec. 18). Past stock market tops, such as in March 2000, showed a cluster of heavy-duty declines in increasing volume. Investor euphoria often is unsustainably high at market tops as well.


Additional Risks
----------------


Five, earnings disappointments in January and February could spark sell-offs. In a bearish scenario, you'll see breakouts by highly rated stocks fail quickly and miserably, and leaders [plummet through their 10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


Six, the cost of borrowing could spike. Keep an eye on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. On Monday, the yield jumped seven basis points to 4.59%, marking the highest close since May 29. Higher yields have historically impacted valuations of stocks. A prolonged rise could force institutions to reassess their projections for corporate earnings, the ability to pay down debt, make acquisitions, and buy back shares.


Seven, a Black Swan event in 2025 is always a possibility. Will it be an expanding military conflict that engulfs Europe? A terrorist event? A serious trade war caused by tariffs? Veteran investors know to expect the unexpected.

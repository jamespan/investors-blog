The stock market can be a counterintuitive place, and that was certainly the case Monday as major averages ended with solid gains in lower volume.

  

There was no shortage of market chatter over the weekend that Monday was going to be a tough session for the stock market in light of the terror attacks in Paris. But it didn't turn out that way.

  

The S&P 500 fared the best, rising 1.5%. Oil and gas stocks buoyed the index as December crude oil futures settled at $41.74 a barrel, up 3%. Of the S&P 500's 10 best percentage gainers, seven hailed from the oil and gas sector.

  

The Dow wasn't far behind, rising 1.4%. The blue-chip index was led by **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) and **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), which rose 4% each.

  

The Nasdaq lagged for the better part of the session but ended with a gain of 1.2%. It picked up the pace late as Nasdaq 100 leaders like **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reversed higher and closed near session highs.

  

Small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. The IBD 50 picked up 1.3%.

  

On the NYSE, winners beat losers by more than 5-to-2. Breadth was a little weaker on the Nasdaq with gainers topping losers by about 3-to-2.

  

The rally in defense stocks and selling in travel-related stocks Monday wasn't counterintuitive at all on the heels of Friday night's terror attacks in Paris.

  

In IBD's aerospace and defense group, big gainers included **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)) and **Northrop Grumman** ([NOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOC)), up 4% each, and **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)), up 3.5%.

  

In the online travel space, **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) got walloped again. It paid a visit to its 200-day moving average, falling another 2%, bringing its seven-day decline to just over 13%. Shares slumped nearly 10% on Nov. 9 after the company offered up disappointing guidance.

  

The distribution day count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remains elevated, and a lot of stocks have moved out of buy ranges already, but that doesn't mean it's time to head for the hills and go to 100% cash, especially in light of Monday's strong showing.

  

Continue to monitor base-building stocks for possible breakouts. Stocks of this ilk include **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)), **Fortune Brands** ([FBHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBHS)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)).

  

**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) bounced back in heavy volume, rising 3%. But Ulta' s weekly decline of 10% last week caused some chart damage that will likely take some time to repair.

  Growth Stocks Lag Value In Stock Market Rally; This Asset Class Fell The Most In October

The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) finished a month of severe selling with mediocre gains on Tuesday. Growth stocks still showed a relatively weaker pulse than their value-oriented siblings.




The Russell 2000's 0.9% rally beat out gains of nearly 0.7% for the S&P 500 and 0.5% for the Nasdaq composite.


The Nasdaq, meanwhile, moved higher for a third straight session to close above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) for the first time in four sessions.


Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), up 0.5%, also rose three days in a row. But it had remained above the long-term technical level during the current spill in the stock market.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Growth definitely underperformed Tuesday.


The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) exchange traded fund rose 0.4%, trailing a 0.9% advance by iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)). However, the former has a stronger 12-month [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) for now, 86 vs. 51.


When it comes to the three-month RS Rating, visible in the Technicals panel for each stock and ETF in MarketSmith, both funds are laggards, however. IWF's 3-month rating of 57 fares only mildly better than a 45 for IWD.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, just as it pretty much has all year long. The blue chip gauge mustered only a 0.4% gain. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) got hammered on a [third-quarter report that included a limp outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/cat-stock-digs-a-hole-ahead-of-dow-jones-bellwethers-q3-report/). Its 16.11-point drop, or 6.7%, to 226.05 in massive volume, weighed on the price-weighted index.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MP103123_2-231x300.jpg)CAT has not only made a nasty round trip of a 17% gain from a breakout past 250.89 in a [five-month cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The construction, mining and oil equipment behemoth fell further below its 200-day line, a sign that its longer-term uptrend is in danger.


Elsewhere, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond was flat at 4.87%, according to Cboe data.


Volume rose moderately on both main stock exchanges vs. Monday. Breadth was positive. Early data showed winning stocks outweighing losers by slightly more than a 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq, and nearly 7-3 on the New York Stock Exchange.


Blood-Red October
-----------------


Monthly results for the stock market, meanwhile, may have given even the most ebullient investor a ghoulish feeling.


The Nasdaq composite suffered its third straight monthly decline. A 2.8% drop this past month to 12,851 sent the premier index for growth stocks 21% below its all-time high 16,212.


This situation makes it reasonable to judge this year as the Nasdaq's continued attempt to recoup sharp stock market losses since the start of 2022.


Elsewhere, the S&P 500 fell 2.2% in October â€” relatively better than the Nasdaq and a 6.9% drubbing of the Russell 2000. Indeed, the Russell appears in danger of crossing into price territory last seen in October of 2020.

Beyond Stock Market: Worst Asset Class In October?
--------------------------------------------------


Yet none of these indexes fared as badly as crude oil.


Light sweet crude oil futures plunged 10.8% for the month to $81.02 a barrel on the NYMEX, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


With the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that has led to a strong counterattack in Gaza and thousands already killed, one might have thought that energy commodities, including oil, would keep rising. The Russia-Ukraine war shows no signs of ending anytime soon as well. But technically, perhaps oil needed to cool off after months of strong gains. The October decline halted a four-month winning streak.


And certain industry groups did not drop as hard. IBD's international oil and gas exploration group ended October down 3.2%. That follows a four-month, 23% ascent.


Some individual names within the energy sector had a pleasant October.



Oil drilling equipment and technology firm **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)) added 1.8% to 93.09 on Tuesday and finished the month up 3%. It may be carving a narrow and shallow cup with handle that pinpoints a 97.88 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The midcap stock market leader holds an 83 Earnings Per Share Rating and a 98 RS score. The new base is at least third stage, however; [the higher the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/), the higher risk of a future breakout failure.

Even though the session wrapped up October with a win for the day, there's certainly plenty of news and data to take in for the rest of the week. Plus, the overall action points to a strategy of high caution and sitting mainly in cash to avoid the possibility of another leg down in prices.

What To Watch On Wednesday
--------------------------


CME's FedWatch survey on Tuesday showed zero chance of any rate hike when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday. In fact, the survey of fed funds interest rate speculators went so far as to show a 3% probability that the central bank will trim short-term rates, currently in a 5.25%-5.5% target range, by a quarter point.


In addition to what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says on Wednesday, the stock market will be watching closely the results of another huge auction of Treasury securities of varying durations. News reports note that more than $113 billion in various government bonds will be sold. A poor auction could send interest rates higher, hurting stocks.


The strong ascent in long-dated U.S. government bond yields has dampened enthusiasm for equities in recent months. Three months ago, the 10-year Treasury yield sat at 3.95%. But during October, the 10-year yield almost closed above 5%.


Will The Flight Out Of Treasuries Continue?
-------------------------------------------


This flight out of U.S. government bonds certainly hasn't helped stocks.


The stock market seems to be sending the message that higher interest rates may act as a stiff headwind for economic growth in the future. Certainly, corporate stock buybacks, a big source of demand generated in stocks, have gotten more expensive. And higher borrowing costs could pinch profit margins across a wide swath of industries.


Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, noted that investors would like to see signs of a stronger rebound in revenue growth in the latest quarter. But from her vantage point, that so far hasn't been the case.


Sonders also thinks the key to the end of the current stock market correction lies in improved breadth in the stock market.


Headed into Tuesday's session, indeed, [fewer of IBD's 33 market sectors](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-30-2023/) show a double-digit gain since Jan. 1 than during the first six months of the year.

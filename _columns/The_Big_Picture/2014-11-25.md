The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have made a habit of touching fresh highs in recent days. It was more of the same Tuesday, although early strength faded and the Nasdaq showed stalling action.

  

At the close, the Nasdaq edged higher by 0.1%; the S&P 500 eased 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE rose slightly from Monday's levels.

  

Oil lost $1.69 to $74.09 a barrel ahead of a key OPEC meeting on Thanksgiving Day.

  

Investors were cheered early by news that third-quarter gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.9%, above an earlier estimate of 3.5% and also above the consensus estimate of 3.3%. In the second quarter, economic growth was 4.6%.

  

A fresh reading on consumer confidence, however, wasn't so good. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 88.7 in November from 94.1 a month earlier. Economists expected a gain to 96.5.

  

The session marked a day of stalling action for the Nasdaq. Stalling, defined as higher volume with little price progress, can be a sign that buying is drying up.

  

In some cases, it can count as a distribution day, but Tuesday's stalling does not immediately add to the count.

  

The Nasdaq also shows three straight weekly gains in lighter volume. New highs in waning volume don't mean trouble is right around the corner, but it's worth noting alongside the few days of recent churning action.

  

Despite some yellow flags, the market uptrend is still intact. The IBD 50 has been lagging the market of late, but the number of breakouts that are working easily have the upper hand over those that aren't.

  

Stocks like **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) are holding gains just fine. **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), meanwhile, is setting up in a cup-shaped base while **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) could try to reclaim a prior buy point.

  

For now, it's an environment where conservative buying makes more sense than aggressive buying.

  

Many stocks have already left the gate after the Nasdaq's follow-through on Oct. 21, but investors still have the green light to buy high-quality growth name breaking out of a well-formed bases.

  

Among Tuesday's gainers, **Century Aluminum** ([CENX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CENX)) reclaimed a 29.64 buy point, rising 6%. After three straight annual losses from 2011-2013, full-year earnings of $1.09 a share are expected in 2014 with annual profit ramping up in 2015 to $2.80.

  

IBD's jewelry industry group outperformed Tuesday, fueled by earnings reports from **Tiffany** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)) and **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)).

  

Tiffany gapped up over a 105.76 buy point but closed off its session high. Shares rose 2.5%. Earnings per share missed expectations, but investors' focus was on better-than-expected same-store sales growth and strong U.S. sales.

  

Signet soared 7%. Strong results were helped by its acquisition of Zale earlier this year.

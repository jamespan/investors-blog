title: Stocks Sputter As Indexes Struggle To Cross This Key Level

Stocks tried to snap out of their funk Monday, only to watch most gains disappear just as the market started another one of the busiest weeks of earnings reports.




The Nasdaq fell more than 0.2% after wiping out a 0.7% gain. The S&P 500 closed a fraction higher but surrendered a 0.5% increase. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%.


Monday's dubious action left the market with new concerns. For two days in a row, indexes have approached the 50-day moving average, only to get turned back down. That raises the possibility that indexes are meeting resistance at that level.


On balance, there's more reason to believe the market is trending upward. Distribution since the [April 10 bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-surge-tariff-relief-bullish-shift-market/) has been minuscule and leading stocks are largely acting well enough. A reduction in April's stock gains is normal following the rebound in the first half of April.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP042318-265x300.jpg)Yet, with each day that indexes stay below the 50-day line, the harder it gets for the market to resume making gains. The 50-day lines themselves have been trending down since late March, though they flattened a bit last week.


Volume was lower Monday, which was a relief. It's always better when stock losses occur in lower trading. Friday was an options expiration day, which tends to cause more trading than usual. Except this past Friday, in which Nasdaq volume fell.


In fact, overall volume has slowed in April. Just by simple measurements, the selling in the second half of March saw more volume than the rebound in April. That soft trend shows up also in the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Both are at a dispirited D-.


If the analysis of the major indexes is mixed, investors can feel better about the leading stocks. Few are breaking down, such as **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) and **Smart Global** ([SGH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGH)), which have sold hard after recent breakouts. However, many [are in buy areas](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) or forming bases.


The IBD 50 is closer to a new high (about 5%) than the major indexes are. The IBD 50 fell 0.6% Monday.

In the energy sector, **Viper Energy Partners** ([VNOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VNOM)) is cruising from a breakout April 5 at 26.29. **Warrior Met Coal** ([HCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HCC)) is forming a base with a 26.53 buy point.


The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is near a four-year high at 2.97%. That's been a new worry for Wall Street, heavily indebted companies, and the financial managers who suddenly face higher costs for borrowing. On the plus side, financials are growing in leadership.


From the IBD 50, **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **Total System Services** ([TSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSS)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) are forming bases. **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) soared on earnings Friday, then gave back a portion of its recent winnings on Monday.


The top group was toy makers, a laggard among the 197 industries ranked by IBD each day. **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) missed expectations for Q1 as the [liquidation of Toys R Us hurt performance](https://www.investors.com/news/hasbro-reports-earnings-sales-stock-sink-toys-r-us-liquidation/). Hasbro shares opened lower but made a bullish reversal that eventually hoisted the group. Other consumer stocks led, including department stores, apparel and specialty retail.


Earnings season is in full bloom, so investors should expect moves that in some cases will spill over to the general market.


**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) was the headliner on Monday after the close. Shares seesawed in after-hours trading after the parent of Google and YouTube [beat profit and revenue estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-earnings-boom-on-investment-gain-revenue-beats/). Alphabet is the second largest stock on the Nasdaq, and one of the largest by market capitalization in the entire U.S. market. As such, it can influence the broad market.

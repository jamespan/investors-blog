Tech Stocks Trigger Bullish Market Signal; Boeing, Cleveland-Cliffs, Microsoft Near Buy Points
===============================================================================================

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite stormed higher Wednesday, triggering a bullish stock market signal. The S&P 500 hit a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed lower.




The Nasdaq rallied as much as 2.1% before paring gains to 1.5% by the close. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4%, while the Dow 30 fell 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added to Tuesday's gain with a 1.1% rise.


Leading growth stocks advanced, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 1% Wednesday. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 13-ranked **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) advanced 6.7%, but remains below its 50-day moving average. The payment system provider is forming a base.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq compared with Tuesday's figures; NYSE volume appeared to be higher also.


Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP033121-265x300.jpg)On Friday, IBD's market outlook [was upgraded](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-late-extends-rebound-leading-stocks-improve/) to a confirmed uptrend following strength in the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500. The latter made a follow-through signal. On Wednesday, it was the Nasdaq's turn to finally show signs of strength after a few dismal weeks. The Nasdaq staged a [bullish follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), giving investors more conviction in the current uptrend.


Despite Wednesday's bullish action in tech stocks, the stock market remains choppy, with a solid number of distribution days. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each still carry five days of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). Typically, a follow-through day will reset the distribution-day count back to zero; however, IBD's market outlook had already been upgraded to a confirmed uptrend.


Volume was unusually heavy in the Nasdaq during the final hour when the index lost some of its gains. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) closed slightly above the 50-day line, but still needs to get above the nearby [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).

While such index action is something to consider, investors should be looking for stocks that are setting up and nearing new buy points. Don't focus on stocks that remain below their 10-week line, or far from their old highs. For example, look at the key differences in tech favorites **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Apple is below its 10-week line and about 15% away from new highs. The stock could be forming a new base, but it's way too early to know for sure. Meanwhile, Microsoft is trying to decisively reclaim its 50-day line and is just 4% away from a [flat base's](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) 246.23 buy point. If tech stocks continue to move higher, Microsoft is far more likely to break out than Apple.


Microsoft is also an [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock.


Stock Market Earnings: Micron Technology
----------------------------------------


Late Wednesday, **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) reported strong fiscal-Q2 results and upbeat guidance. The stock rallied about 3% in overnight trade. Shares closed just above their 50-day line Wednesday.

Breakout Stocks To Watch: Boeing, Cleveland-Cliffs
--------------------------------------------------


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) is still in the 5% buy area past a 244.18 buy point in a cup base. The buy zone ends at 256.39. Shares closed at 254.48 amid Wednesday's 1.1% rise.


Per Leaderboard commentary, "The latest base showed a much shallower drop than the huge consolidation resulting from the 2020 coronavirus crash. At the same time, Boeing could afford to keep building the right side of the mega-cup pattern and offer new entry points."


Top steelmaker **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) surged past an 18.06 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stock-market-double-bottom-inphi-stock-earnings/) after the company guided first-quarter and full-year EBITDA estimates above Wall Street expectations. Shares closed extended from the entry.


According toÂ [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), CLF stock shows an 86 out of a perfect 99 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), but that will surely improve following Wednesday's surge.


Cleveland-Cliffs was featured as [Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/clf-stock-top-steelmaker-cleveland-cliffs-gives-strong-q1-2021-guidance/).

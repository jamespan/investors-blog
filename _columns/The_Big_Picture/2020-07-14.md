  Stocks Today Show Bullish Resolve; Why This Technical Level Matters For Leaders

You know that hackneyed phrase, "All's well that ends well." Well, that certainly wasn't the case Monday. But it painted the picture of [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) just about perfectly.




In Monday's final hour of trading, the Nasdaq squandered its remaining gains in a waterfall-like sell-off and closed down 2.1%. The tech-heavy composite recorded a new [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). Bad closes always leave a bad taste in an investor's mouth, right?


That's why Tuesday's session offered refreshment.


Those who desired to sell late on Monday likely ditched their shares early Tuesday. So, 45 minutes into the session, the Nasdaq sank to as low as 10,182. That marked a nose-dive of 642 points, or 6%, from a new all-time peak of 10,824. So, was Tuesday's session going to mirror this bearish action?


Turned out that this afternoon gave fund managers a chance to respond bullishly.

The final 40 minutes of trading Tuesday belonged to the bulls, and the Nasdaq rallied into the session close, up 0.9%. That did not recoup all of Monday's losses. But at 10,488, the leading index for growth companies sits just 3% below its peak. For now, the Nasdaq shows reluctance to head into a significant pullback.


Coronavirus Fears Won't Go Away YetMP071420
-------------------------------------------


News late in Monday's session about California's decision to re-close certain businesses offered the perfect excuse for portfolio managers to nail down profits. But limited declines in the coming days and weeks would hint that cash won't stay on the sidelines long.


The S&P 500 gained 1.3%, recouping all of Monday's 0.9% decline and more. Small caps echoed this bullish reaction.


The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), which lost 1.3% on Monday, hammered out a 1.7% advance. As seen in a daily chart, the popular ETF respected its now-rising 50-day moving average.


Volume dipped vs. the prior session on both main exchanges. See this as a minor blemish. Breadth was bullish; winners led losers by a 5-3 margin on the Nasdaq, and nearly 2 to 1 on the NYSE.



New economic data offered some encouragement.


The NFIB small business optimism index showed a stronger-than-expected gain in June (100.6 vs. a consensus estimate of 96.1). Meanwhile, core U.S. retail prices exceeded the [Econoday view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for a 0.1% month-on-month gain, up 0.2%. The CPI headline number rose 0.6% vs. May, also above the consensus forecast.


The economy and corporate earnings have not changed dramatically in the past 24 hours. Stocks are climbing a wall of worry built on Covid-19. Some sectors are leading growth in new ways of how we conduct work and play.


Stocks Today: A New Wall Street Habit?
--------------------------------------


For years, IBD stories have noted the importance of the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Good stocks behave in an interesting way when they penetrate this medium-term technical level. A bounce off this line — or its cousin, the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) — following a breakout suggests mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are taking the pullback as an opportunity to build out their positions.


Lately, [the 21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) has served as another pinpoint level of institutional buying support in the near term.


Consider **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)), **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)). All six stocks today tangled with their respective [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) before hustling higher. ([MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) allows users to plot a 21-day exponential moving average.)


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF briefly cut below its 21-day line before reversing higher for a 1.3% gain.


Dynatrace Stock
---------------



Few big winners have fallen hard enough to test the 50-day line. **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), discussed often on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) since November, made its first such test since it surged past a 30.91 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a deep [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on May 7. Earnings have blossomed from a penny a share in 2017 to an expected 41 cents this year, up 32% vs. 31 cents in 2019.


Among seven stocks making the [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) list headed into Tuesday, four rose and three fell. The biggest advances topped the sharpest declines.

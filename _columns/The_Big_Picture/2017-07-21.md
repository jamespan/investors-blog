Nasdaq Ends Win Streak; PetIQ Debuts With Nice Gains
=====================================================

U.S. stock indexes posted small losses Friday, as the Nasdaq ended its win streak at 10 days.




The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each eased less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 retreated 0.45%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The 10-session win streak for the Nasdaq was the best since 2015. However, the importance of such streaks is arguable.


The Nasdaq's streak involved three sessions with gains of 0.2% or less. A little less buying here and a little more selling there and the streak could've ended sooner.

In all, it was a decent way to end the Nasdaq streak, with minimal losses. Looking forward, it will be significant if the composite can stay above 6340, about where it peaked before last week's new highs.


Also, shifts in market leadership are crucial since they can help position investors correctly.


In the past three weeks, groups keeping their rankings in the top 40 include telecom, biotechs, homebuilders and solar.


Groups rising sharply either within or into the top 40 include soft drinks, home furnishings and chipmakers.


Groups sinking fast include hospitals, gold miners and restaurants.


Among restaurants are some troubled former leaders. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), now a laggard, will report quarterly results Thursday. The Street expects a 12% EPS pop, which would be the smallest in at least 19 quarters.


On Friday, homebuilders technically led the pack. The group rose 7%, but that was largely because of an 8% thrust by **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)). The industry group performance is price weighted, and NVR's share price of 2,648.45 gives it an outsize influence on the group.


The lopsided weighting can mislead investors. On Friday, the average gain excluding NVR was 0.3%.


The true leaders of the day were fiber optics, which had plenty of gainers within the group.


**PetIQ** ([PETQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETQ)) made its debut on the Nasdaq. Priced at 16, the stock closed at 22.95. PetIQ makes and distributes veterinarian-grade medications for pets. According to PetIQ's SEC filing, Americans' spending on pets has nearly tripled since 2001.


The pet trend is turning political. The Fairness to Pet Owners Act is pending before Congress. The legislation would boost the migration of prescription drugs for pets to the retail channel. If enacted, the law would likely increase sales for PetIQ.

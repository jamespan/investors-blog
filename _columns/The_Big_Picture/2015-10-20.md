The stock market gave back a bit of its October rally Tuesday, but certainly not enough to derail it. The Nasdaq lost 0.5%, as renewed selling in biotechs and other Nasdaq-residing medicals dragged the composite. **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) said at its earnings announcement late Monday that controversy over high drug prices is leading the company to consider new strategies. Investors no doubt took it as a bad sign for industry profits.

  

The S&P 500 and the small-cap Russell 2000 eased 0.1% each. Yet winners beat losers by about 3-to-2 on the NYSE, a curious divergence. Decliners edged past advancers on the lagging Nasdaq.

  

Volume rose across the board, which gave the Nasdaq its fourth distribution day of the past few weeks. While that's an acceptable number of higher-volume declines, Tuesday's selling came just as the composite has reached a key level on its chart: the 200-day moving average.

  

The Nasdaq met resistance at that long-term price indicator on Sept. 17. That coincided with resistance at the 50-day moving average, which led to a 10% slide.

  

But the Nasdaq last week was able to fight its way back above the 50-day average — a triumph, at least for the short term.

  

No doubt, the main indexes have slowed their ascent. That's a necessary digestive step if the market is to continue climbing.

  

While chart watchers wait to see how the next test of resistance goes, a favorable shift is occurring.

  

In the earlier days of the market uptrend, smaller stocks were the ones breaking out. **Ultimate Software** ([ULTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTI)), **Autobytel** ([ABTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABTL)), **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) and **Heartland Payment Systems** ([HPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPY)) were part of that small- and mid-cap wave.

  

But now more big caps have joined the breakout orbit, such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)) and **Ecolab** ([ECL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ECL)).

  

That type of broadening participation can only be a plus for the market as it tries to continue its advance.

  

It's not just among breakouts where bigger stocks are getting stronger. IBD's graph of small-cap vs. big-cap growth funds (today on Page A11) shows small caps trending lower since July.

  

The main risk for stock investors now is earnings season, which is in full swing.

  

After the close, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) plunged after the restaurant chain's third-quarter earnings were unpleasant.

  

**Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) was down modestly in extended trading following profits that missed estimates and an outlook that was weaker.

  

But homebuilder stocks were one of the day's leaders — up more than 2% — after the Commerce Department reported a 6.5% jump in September housing starts. Several stocks in the group climbed above the 50-day moving average, yet most are still forming bases. The industry group ranked sixth out of 197 groups in Tuesday's IBD.

  

The IBD 50 fell 0.7% Tuesday.

  

**Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) led the IBD 50 with a 5% surge to a new high. The Arkansas-based multi-state lender said late Monday it will acquire Community & Southern Holdings in an $800 million deal. Regional banks remain a hot area of the market.

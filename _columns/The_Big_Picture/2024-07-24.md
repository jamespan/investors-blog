  Nasdaq Pummeled As Stock Market Outlook Gets This Downgrade; Alphabet Triggers Sell Rule

The first batch of earnings news on significant [stock market leaders](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx), delivered late Tuesday, sent quite a bearish message on Wednesday. And one of the true torch bearers of the eight-month-long uptrend, Google operator **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), showed a negative change in character.




The big, broad declines came amid a perhaps too-high optimism among newsletter pundits. This is the seventh straight week in which the bullish ratio was 60% or higher, typically a level in which the market takes a break.


And volatility, as measured by the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), spiked 24% to hit a three-month high at 18.32. (You can view more stock market sentiment indicators on the [Psychological Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) under Market Trend at Investors.com.)


On Wednesday, the Nasdaq gapped lower at the market open, and kept dropping throughout practically the entire regular session. At 17,342, the composite index lost 3.6%, finishing almost at session lows.


The Nasdaq composite also recorded its biggest hit since Oct. 7, 2022, and since a [follow-through day on Nov. 1 flagged a new confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-marks-this-bullish-shift-after-fed-chief-powells-decision-to-leave-rates-unchanged/).


Notice on a daily chart how the Nasdaq also closed beneath its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since May 2.



In general, healthy bull markets show the major indexes rising above their 50-day lines, not cratering below them.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The NYSE composite lost just 1.1%, much less than the Nasdaq's terrible mauling. But the NYSE composite also dropped in five of the past six sessions. It has now backtracked 2.5% since posting a closing high of 18,781 on July 16.


The S&P 500 also got whacked, falling 2.3%. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) dove 1.2%. It now shows a mild gain of 1.8% in the current quarter.


Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1.3%, much less than a 2.1% punch to the gut of the Russell 2000. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) exchange traded fund slumped 1.9%, cutting its gain in 2024 to 7.9%.


Volume surged on the NYSE and Nasdaq, another strong hint that institutional investors took profits exuberantly.


Nasdaq turnover jumped 36% to 6.74 billion shares. The NYSE saw 3.95 billion shares switch hands, up 13% vs. Tuesday.


Breadth in the stock market floundered, understandably. According to early data, losers topped winners on the Nasdaq by a 3-1 ratio. On the NYSE, falling stocks led rising ones by more than 4 to 1.


Change In Stock Market Outlook
------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MP072424-206x300.jpg)Due to extensive damage seen in recent sessions, it may come as no surprise for veteran Big Picture column readers to see the suggested exposure to the stock market drop to 40%-60%. This means for active investors, raising a good amount of cash serves to add some shock absorbers to the portfolio in the event that the decline deepens.


Just five sessions earlier, IBD's outlook got lowered to 60%-80% from the maximum range of 80%-100%.


This change means active traders and investors would benefit from quickly taking gains in some existing positions, cutting losing stocks, and sitting on one's hands for the most part. In the increasingly rocky environment, playing more defense and keeping one's guard up is key. It will likely take time and patience before the high-probability trade on new breakouts works out well.


Year to date, the Nasdaq's gain has shrunk to 16.3%. That's still quite healthy, though. The S&P 500 holds a 14.2% advance.


According to stock market historians Jeff Hirsch and Christopher Mistral in the 2024 edition of the Stock Trader's Almanac, the week after the July expiration of options is prone to wild swings. Monthly options on stock and index options expired last Friday.


Hirsch noted, however, that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has actually risen in 15 of the past 25 occasions during this time frame.


They include a 4.3% weekly drop back in July 1998 after the monthly options expired; a 3.1% rise in 2002; a 4.2% swing lower in 2007; and gains of 4% and 3.2% in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Not-So-Magnificent Seven
------------------------


All Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks got bruised badly on the heels of two of its key members. And Alphabet, the web advertising and cloud computing giant, gave recent buyers its first clear-cut sell signal in months. The stock, which reported weaker-than-expected revenue from its YouTube video service, dropped nearly 5% in heavy trading. It also sank as much as 3% beneath the 10-week moving average, which has been rising sharply since mid-April.



That break of the 10-week line in heavier-than-usual volume marks a [highly useful sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/), especially for holders who are seeing their profits in the stock get squeezed.


The average loss by the Magnificent Seven stocks? A severe 4.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


In the meantime, not all breakout attempts by other companies in the stock market have fared well.


Consider **GE Aerospace** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)). On Tuesday, GE Aerospace looked like it was ready to rocket to big gains after reporting a 62% jump in second-quarter earnings. The stock rose more than 5% in spirited turnover, the heaviest in at least 13 weeks for an up day. At the day's high of 177.20, GE also climbed as much as 4% above a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 170.80.


But the stock reversed course badly on Wednesday. It dived 5.6% to 162.30, back into its base. The stock remains above key moving averages. But that's not the kind of action you'd expect on Day 2 of a new breakout.


Sales at the jet engine maker rose 4% to $9.1 billion, a deceleration from year-over-year rises of 20%, 15% and 14% in the prior three quarters, [according to MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF).


On the bullish side, **Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) padded its gains after breaking out past a 331.08 entry on Tuesday. The entertainment firm got plenty of airtime during [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A).

Industry Group Leaders
----------------------


Even before Wednesday's bloodbath, IBD's industry group rankings have reflected a rotation into other areas in the stock market beyond the tech realm.


IBD's Medical-Long Term Care group ranked No. 1 as of Tuesday's close in terms of six-month relative price performance. Up 37.9% year to date, the group is not large in terms of the number of stocks, but it has plenty of small-cap and midcap firms with sharp IBD ratings. No wonder, then, its [Group Composite Rating stands tall at 91](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jul-23-2024/). Keep an eye on future changes by going to [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


In other financial markets, gold stumbled after hitting a peak of $2,433 an ounce, finishing off 0.4%. Silver cooled 0.8% while copper futures sank 1.9% to $4.08 a pound.


The yield on the key U.S. government bond edged up four basis points to 4.28%, ahead of Friday's inflation report.

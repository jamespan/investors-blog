Stock market indexes rebounded Monday in a decidedly mixed day for the major gauges, while there was little to change the market's overall tone.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average led with a 1.2% gain courtesy of support at the 21-day exponential moving average.


The S&P 500 bounced 0.9% and closed barely back above its 21-day line. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%, its closing price nearly matching the 21-day average.


At 13,994, the Nasdaq could look to find support around 13,840. That was an area of resistance in June and early July.


Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 rose only 0.1%. The IBD 50 index outperformed 2.7%, thanks to rallies of 4%-6% in travel leaders **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), **Carnival** ([CCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCL)) and **Royal Caribbean** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)).


Some Reasons For Skepticism
---------------------------


Volume fell on the NYSE and Nasdaq from Friday's levels, a sign that institutions didn't go whole hog on Monday's rebound.


From studying charts, there are four other reasons to believe the stock market has more unwinding to do.


* Bearish price reversals July 27 and Friday on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were concerning, especially when some of those reversals engulfed prior price bars.
* With last week's lows, the Nasdaq is no longer in a trend of higher highs and higher lows. Its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) has deteriorated to D.
* Both the S&P and Nasdaq fell last week below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), which had offered support to both indexes since May. Regaining those levels would be crucial for a rebound to continue.
* The stock market's largest stock, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), is breaking down. The stock gapped below its 50-day moving average Friday and extended losses Monday.


Apple stock seemed invincible before Thursday's earnings report, but now it's wiped out two months of gains. That's not a good look for a stock responsible for so much of this year's bull market. And Apple [no longer has the fundamentals](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-drops-as-iphone-maker-sales-decline-again/) to justify big gains.

For now, however, the [pool of stocks in bases is pretty dry](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/pool-is-drying-up-on-growth-stock-set-ups/). Support at the 10-week line and three-weeks-tight patterns provide some follow-on opportunities right now.


Stock Market Faces Inflation Data
---------------------------------


On Thursday, the consumer price index for June comes out, and the next day the producer price index is announced.


Over the weekend, Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman said the Fed will likely need to raise interest rates some more to bring inflation down to target levels.


Unlike the Fed, government agencies do not telegraph their moves ahead of time. So there's more of a surprise factor in inflation reports than with Fed policy announcements.


Last week, IBD moderated its stock market outlook to "uptrend under pressure" and cut the suggested exposure to 60%-80%. After a smashing performance in the first seven months of 2023, the stock market almost deserves a break.


The Nasdaq just had its [best first seven months](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-caps-another-good-month-with-gains-sp-nasdaq-havent-done-this-in-decades/) of any year since 1975. The S&P 500 had its best first seven months since 1997. What can investors expect after such a strong performance?


Historically, market gains moderate after such strong starts to the year. Each year the S&P 500 climbed more than 15% in the first seven months, the next five months saw average gains of 7%, according to Ned Davis Research. The good news? The S&P fell over the final five months in less than 14% of those years.


Stock Market Laden With Earnings Reports
----------------------------------------


While most of the S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter earnings, hundreds of quarterly reports are being filed each day.


**United Parcel Service** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)), an economic bellwether, will [announce results Tuesday before the open](https://www.investors.com/news/ups-stock-to-face-financial-headwinds-due-to-labor-deal-earnings-on-deck/). **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) and **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) (both Wednesday) will provide some insights on U.S. consumers.



According to a FactSet report, nearly 85% of S&P 500 companies have reported Q2 earnings. Of these, 79% topped EPS estimates, which is above the five-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. On the whole, the S&P 500 is beating views by 7.2%. That's below the five-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.


And here's the more interesting data: On average, even the stocks that beat expectations aren't getting any love from investors.


Companies that beat profit estimates saw their shares *drop* an average 0.5% in the two days before the earnings release through the two days after the release. This is well below the five-year average price *increase* of 1% for earnings winners.


Stock Market Not Cheering Earnings Winners Much
-----------------------------------------------


FactSet's senior earnings analyst, John Butters, says the S&P is on track for the largest average negative price reaction to positive EPS surprises since the second quarter of 2011, when they fell 2.1%.Â S&P 500 companies that missed Q2 profit estimates are falling 2.4% in the four-day window FactSet measures. That's also worse than the five-year average of -2.2%.


Why the gloom?


Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, believes the S&P 500's 2023 rally anticipated strong Q2 earnings. Also, companies are beating views because managers are cutting costs.


"Revenue growth is, in the aggregate, almost zero (+0.6%)," Colas said in a report Monday. "Investors rightly pay less for margin management-fueled earnings surprises than those driven by stronger-than-expected top-line growth."


Expected Q3 and Q4 revenue growth is just 1.3% and 3.4% respectively, which limits the possibility of large upside earnings surprises.


"We don't see anything inherently worrisome about the market's odd behavior around Q2 earnings surprises, but it is a good reminder that margin management only goes so far in supporting investor sentiment," Colas added.

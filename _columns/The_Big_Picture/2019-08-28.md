Blue Chips, Small Caps Lead Market Rally; Walmart Sets Up In Bullish Base
==========================================================================

The stock market recovered nicely after a soft start Wednesday. But the gains didn't do much to improve the market's technical picture, and a weak outlook from **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) weighed on the software sector.




The Russell 2000 small-cap index and Dow Jones industrials led the way, up 1.15% and 1%, respectively. Bullish charts in the Dow include **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)). Home Depot is back in buy range from a 219.40 entry; Walmart is crafting a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 115.03 buy point and Merck is trading just below the 87.17 entry.


The S&P 500 picked up 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in lower than Tuesday's levels. Stock market bulls want to see indexes rising in higher volume and falling in lower volume, but it's generally been the opposite since the Aug. 13 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MP082819-248x300.jpg)Energy stocks outperformed as oil prices rose. U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.6% to $55.78 a barrel after U.S. supply data showed a big decline in crude inventories.


Software stocks faced another round of selling. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) slumped 2.1% early but pared losses. Shares fell 1.2%, weighed down by a 6.7% plunge in shares of **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)). **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), the second highest-weighted stock in the ETF, slumped 2.5%. Earnings and sales at Autodesk topped expectations, but [the company guided lower](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/autodesk-earnings-q2-2020-adsk-stock/) for the current quarter and full year.


Software-related industry groups were among the day's worst performers, and the biggest decliners in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) all hailed from the software sector. **Anaplan** ([PLAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAN)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) ended with losses of 2% to 7%.


Bond Yields In Focus
--------------------


Bond yields stayed in focus as the 30-year Treasury bond hit a record low. The yield hit a session low of 1.905% but ended off lows at 1.94%. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield hit its lowest level since July 2016. It traded around 1.47%, still below the two-year yield at 1.5%.


Stock Market Health
-------------------


The distribution-day count has been rising for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500, but headed into Wednesday both indexes were only 5% to 6% off their highs. That means it's still too early to fully embrace a bearish thesis. The stock market could still go either way from here.


The S&P 500 is range-bound, basically trading between its 50-day moving average around 2945 and 2800, a round-number support level to watch. The S&P 500's 200-day moving average is around 2803. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's 50-day moving average remains a significant resistance level to conquer.


Wall Street is dealing with uncertainty on many fronts. The China trade war and fears of a recession for the U.S. economy remain focal points.


Meanwhile, the British pound fell sharply Wednesday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson implemented a procedural attempt to suspend Parliament for several weeks ahead of Britain's scheduled exit from the European Union at the end of October. The move raises the odds of a no-deal Brexit, which could throw the U.K. economy into recession and send ripple effects throughout the euro zone.

With the stock market uptrend under pressure, it still makes sense to limit exposure. It's OK to nibble conservatively if new setups are there for the taking, but it's still a market under mild distribution, which is generally a tougher environment for stocks to make headway in and for breakouts to succeed.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) continue to attract buyers, but an early jump faded for Costco after a powerful breakout Tuesday. New Oriental, meanwhile, cleared a 110 buy point Wednesday in volume 13% above average.



Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) performed mostly in line with the broad market, up 0.7%.


**MasTec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)) was a top gainer in the IBD 50. Shares jumped nearly 3% to 61.49. It completed a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) last week. MasTec was analyzed in [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-mastec-infrastructure-play-shakes-off-resistance/) this week.

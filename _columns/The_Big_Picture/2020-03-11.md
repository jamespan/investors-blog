Just one day after the stock market started a rally attempt, indexes made new lows Wednesday after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. A bearish market call from Goldman Sachs didn't help matters.




More than 70 groups in IBD's database lost 6% or more. The Dow Jones tumbled 5.9% and is now 20% off its high. The blue-chip index is officially in bear market territory along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which dived 6.4%. The S&P 500 lost 4.9% and the Nasdaq composite slumped 4.7%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in slightly lower than Tuesday.


Goldman Sachs expects a "collapse" in second- and third-quarter profits and set a midyear S&P 500 price target of 2450, down from 2741 at the market's close Wednesday.


Fear was on display in the stock market again Wednesday, with the put-call ratio hitting 1.39. Excessive fear has been seen at market bottoms in the past, but it's been a fearful market for a while now.

That was the case Wednesday as sellers finally came into shares of **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)).


Stock Market Today: Boeing Dives
--------------------------------


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) cratered 18% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on reports the company plans to use the full amount of a $13.825 billion loan, while [taking steps to preserve cash](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-orders-february-2020-737-max-boeing-stock/). Not only is Boeing dealing with 737 Max issues, but plane deliveries will likely suffer as a result of the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak


But some large-cap stocks are holding up well, including **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)). The drugmaker is testing support at its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) after a breakout from a base in December. Goldman Sachs added Eli Lilly to its conviction buy list Wednesday. Selling pressure was muted in **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) as well. The biotech and **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)) are testing a rheumatoid arthritis drug for use as a possible Covid-19 treatment. Sideways movement for Regeneron in coming weeks could give an alternate entry.



According to data from Johns Hopkins, global Covid-19 cases now total nearly 125,000, with 1,135 in the U.S. In related news, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) unit Google on Wednesday said it wants North American staff to work from home. After the close, the NCAA said its national basketball tournament, known as March Madness, will be played without fans.


Profit-Taking Hits Bonds
------------------------


Bond yields have been falling with stock prices lately, but profit takers came into the bond market Wednesday, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 7 basis points to 0.87%.


The Federal Reserve meets next week, and the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to cut interest rates again. But whether it will be enough to bring buyers into the stock market remains to be seen. The Fed stepped in with an emergency rate cut last week, but major stock indexes reversed lower on the news. The Bank of England also cut rates Wednesday, but European bourses faded from early gains.


The Nasdaq composite pulled back 19.5% in 2015-16 and nearly 24% in the second half of 2018. The first pullback took seven months to play out. The second one took four months.


The current pullback is not even two months old, but the Nasdaq composite is already 19% off its prior high. The main uncertainty is what a slowdown for the U.S. economy will ultimately look like. Will GDP growth slow from 2% to 1%, or is the U.S. economy headed for a recession? Or is it already in one?


It bears repeating that a stock market correction is not the time to be buying stocks. IBD put the [market outlook in correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) on Feb. 25, the same day the Nasdaq decisively undercut its 50-day moving average. Many IBD readers had been raising cash before then, but the stock market's weak action on Feb. 25 was another reminder that raising cash was the right strategy.


Building Watchlists
-------------------


The point has been hammered home recently in this space, but it bears repeating. Instead of looking for stocks to short, spend time building a watchlist of stocks that have potential to be stock market leaders. Many will have [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) near highs, while holding key price support levels.

One interesting name mentioned on IBD Live Wednesday is new issue **1Life Healthcare** ([ONEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONEM)). Shares got dragged down with the broad market Wednesday, but it's still working on an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) also deserve a spot on the watchlist.


The resilience of select China stocks has been a noteworthy development amid broad-based weakness in most other areas of the stock market. Good names now for the watchlist include **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), **ZTO Express** ([ZTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZTO)), **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)), **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Bilibili** ([BILI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BILI)). Some of those still need to set up new patterns.

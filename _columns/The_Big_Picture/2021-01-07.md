  Stock Market Rally Hits Record Highs As Congress Certifies Biden Win; 3 Top Stocks To Watch

The major stock indexes powered higher Thursday as the stock market hit all-time highs. Early Thursday, Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden's win, while President Donald Trump vowed an "orderly transition" of power.




The news brought some calm after a day of rioting on Capitol Hill over election results. Indexes faded Wednesday afternoon as images of the political strife emerged.


The Nasdaq advanced 2.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.9%. The S&P 500 ascended 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average followed up with a 0.7% rise.


Meanwhile, leading growth stocks outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up 3.1% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 12-ranked **Monolith Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) surged 6.3% to reclaim a 358.79 buy point in a cup base. Shares ended the session out of the 5% buy zone, which goes up to 376.73.


Volume was sharply lower compared with Wednesday's session on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


Nasdaq, S&P 500 Hit Record Highs
--------------------------------


![MP010721](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MP010721-241x300.jpg)After a rough start to 2021, the stock market again powered up. All three major stock indexes set record highs. (Be sure to check out [IBD's 2021 Stock Market Forecast](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-2021-could-be-bumpier-than-you-think/).)


Bullishly, the Nasdaq's Dec.3 distribution day fell off the count. When an index rises 5% or more from the closing price of the distribution day, then the distribution day is no longer considered relevant to the current stock market trend.


There are now three [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) on the Nasdaq, while there are still four on the S&P 500. Amid a moderate amount of institutional selling, investors should still feel confident buying strong breakouts.


Keep in mind the Nasdaq is sharply extended from its 50-day moving average, ending more than 7% above it on Thursday. Historically, when the Nasdaq is about 6% above its 50-day line, it will typically begin to pull back.


Pullbacks, even sharp ones, would be considered a natural part of a sustained uptrend. But it's not an imminent sell signal by any means. Indexes can remain extended for a long time. Ahead of the September correction, the Nasdaq closed 11.6% above the 50-day line on Sept. 2 after being more than 6% above that level for weeks.


Instead of trying to predict what the stock market will do from here, it's better to interpret the daily price and volume action of the major stock indexes and the stock market leaders. For now, the trend is upward, and investors should be positioned accordingly.


Lastly, always be mindful to lock in gains on the upside. Taking profits on the upside can help you stomach some of the eventual sharp breaks that occur during a stock's natural price move. Investors should take at least some profits when a stock rises 20%-25% from its buy point.



Notably, [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is off to a strong start in 2021, after surging 743% in 2020. Year to date, Tesla is already up 15.6% amid a 10-day win streak. Tesla CEO Elon Musk [dethroned Jeff Bezos](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-surge-makes-elon-musk-worlds-richest-person-topping-jeff-bezos/) as the world's richest person.


Shares set a record high at 816.99 Thursday, advancing as much as 75% above a 466 buy point in another [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).

[Dow Jones leader](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is adding a handle to a cup base in the wake of a sell signal from a 138.08 buy point. On Jan. 4, shares fell more than 7% below the buy point, triggering the key loss-cutting rule. The new [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is 138.89. The stock advanced 3.4% on Thursday, but is still about 6% away from the new entry.


[IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) regained its 1,366.76 buy point as it bounced off its 50-day line. Shares rose 1.8%.


Chip stocks were among the best performers on the day. 5G leader **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) is in the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) above a 171 buy point in anÂ [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-rare-ascending-base-pattern/). Shares advanced 3.8% Thursday, ending squarely in buy range following Wednesday's breakout move. The buy area tops out at 179.55.


Qorvo was discussed in [Thursday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).


Elsewhere in the semiconductor industry, **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) added 5.35% and 5.8%, respectively. AMD stock is rebounding from a test of its 88.82 double-bottom entry, while Nvidia continues to trace a flat base with a 587.76 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis.

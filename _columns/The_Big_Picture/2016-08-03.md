Stocks Rebound Mildly As Small Caps Lead; Is The Bull Still Resting?
=====================================================================

Tuesday's sell-off among stocks doesn't look as bad now, given the broad rebound on Wednesday. Yet one key ingredient was missing: higher volume.


The Nasdaq composite prevailed in a snaillike race by the major indexes, up 0.4%. The S&P 500 gained 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrials inched ahead 0.2%, ending a seven-day losing streak.


The Russell 2000 looked healthier, as judged by its 0.9% lift on Wednesday. Yet perhaps it had more lost ground to make up, losing 1.4% on Tuesday. The Russell 2000 is up 6.8% since Jan. 1, beating a 5.9% gain by the S&P 500.


As noted in this column on Tuesday, a significant pullback would not be surprising at this point, given the surprising rally by stocks following the panic attack that shook Wall Street for two days following the U.K.'s decision to depart the European Union. Yet for now, growth investors can maintain a "glass is half-full" mentality. Why? Here are a few observations.


![MP080316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MP080316-184x300.jpg)One, all of the major indexes, including the Russell, are trading above their 50-day moving averages, and these moving average lines are rising. So the intermediate trend is up.


Two, the market is supplying anecdotal evidence that mutual funds, pensions and other deep-pocketed portfolio managers are coming to the defense of their favorite equities as they test support at either the 50-day or 10-week moving averages. Note that these two tools can slightly diverge, because the former takes into account 50 days' of closing prices while the latter only relies on 10 separate closing weekly prices.


Cases in point: **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) (99 Composite Rating on **[IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-installed-building-prod-ibp.aspx)**), **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) (97 Composite), **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) (93) and **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) (85), the Leaderboard member that reports Q2 results on Thursday after the close. All four stocks have found support at the 50-day line.


Three, energy stocks are stabilizing, except perhaps for the solar firms. Go to the link at the bottom of this article and check out the bottom 40 groups within IBD's daily ranking of 197 industries. Last year, oil stocks commanded the bottom. No longer. In fact, **Southwestern Energy** ([SWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWN)), **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) and **Pioneer Natural Resource**s ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) are among a small yet growing group of oil and gas producers that are now basing. Given that energy makes up a large portion of the S&P 500, this is significant.


Four, the market's technicals remain sound. Except for Tuesday's session, the number of [stocks making new highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-august-2-2016/) on the Nasdaq and the NYSE continue to exceed 100 on both major exchanges and dwarf new lows.  On Wednesday, gainers beat losers by a 2-to-1 margin on both markets.


What is the caveat to all the above arguments?


Few seasoned investors would disagree that the market has been unusually jumpy -- not jumpy in the sense of a 10% swing in prices from week to week or even month to month, but in the sense that some highly rated stocks have been bobbing and weaving around their proper buy points.


So, if your frustration level in 2016 is above your 10- or 20-year moving average, take solace in the fact that you're likely not alone. The market reflects uncertainty over what the Fed will do, how bad things could get in the EU sans Britain, who will take the Oval Office in January, and whether the doomsday scenarios given by pessimists on Wall Street regarding China's huge debt mountain will actually happen.


One possible way to see if China is going to tighten its fiscal belt: Watch the yields of U.S. government bonds, particularly the 10-year Treasury bonds. China, along with debt powerhouse Japan, are gigantic buyers of American bonds. A sudden urge by the Chinese to raise cash and sell U.S. bonds could disrupt financial markets here. The 10-year yield, at 1.54% after Wednesday's close, has edged higher in recent weeks yet is still locked in a downward spiral.


What is definitely true today? We are not seeing sensational headlines about the Chinese equity markets, unlike last summer. Remember the market's gyrations in August 2015, when it seemed almost a daily occurrence for the Shanghai or tech-heavy Shenzhen composite indexes to fall 5% or more? Mainland Chinese stocks are still in a bear market, yet the Shanghai composite is up almost 13% from its late-January low.
